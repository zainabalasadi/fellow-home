# Week 1
Formed the group. Discussed with team the skills each member had and what project we wanted to do.
Ended up choosing Project 3 - Accommodation Web Portal. Made Google docs and a Facebook group to 
communicate ideas and features for the project. Did research on competitors (i.e. other rental sites)
and made a list of their advantages and disadvantages.

# Week 2
Decided on making a student accommodation site for finding housemates. Did more research on competitors 
(i.e. other student accommodation sites) and started finalising features of the project. Assigned 
different roles to each member. I was assigned to be a back-end developer. Discussed software (GitHub 
Project Board)to help manage the project and software (python/js)to be used to build the project.
Started working on the technical depth section of the proposal. Did research on setting up REST APIs
and relational/non-relational databases.

# Week 3
Continued working on the technical depth section and epics section of the proposal. Finished off the 
proposal at the end of the week and had a group call discussing what we would do next. We decided that
the next spring would be focused on accounts and front page stuff. I setup Docker, React, Postgres, and
Flask so that everyone could start working on the actual project.

# Week 4
Started doing research on authentication methods and eventually settled with using JWT to authenticate 
users. Also started creating a basic UML diagram to model the backend portion of the system and split up 
tasks that needed to be completed by the next sprint. I was tasked with scraping fake data for the 
system and working on other parts of the backend. I also helped the others with problems they had with 
setting up Docker.

# Week 5
Continued adding features to the authentication module such as registering users and logging them out. 
Started scraping fake user data for the system. Also continued to help with problems concerning Docker 
and working locally. Updated the models such that they would work properly with SQLAlchemy.
