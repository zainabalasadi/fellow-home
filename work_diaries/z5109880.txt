# Week 1
Formed the group. Discussed with team the skills each member had and what project we wanted to do.
Ended up choosing Project 3 - Accommodation Web Portal. Made Google docs and a Facebook group to 
communicate ideas and features for the project. Did research on competitors (i.e. other rental sites)
and made a list of their advantages and disadvantages.

# Week 2
Decided on making a student accommodation site for finding housemates. Did more research on competitors 
(i.e. other student accommodation sites) and started finalising features of the project. Assigned 
different roles to each member. I was assigned to be a back-end developer. Discussed software (GitHub 
Project Board)to help manage the project and software (python/js)to be used to build the project.
Started working on the technical depth section of the proposal. Did research on setting up REST APIs
and relational/non-relational databases.

# Week 3
Continued working on the technical depth section and epics section of the proposal. Finished off the 
proposal at the end of the week and had a group call discussing what we would do next. We decided that
the next spring would be focused on accounts and front page stuff. I setup Docker, React, Postgres, and
Flask so that everyone could start working on the actual project.
