Group was formed. Project 1 was most preferable with the group, but I was not confident in being able to deliver as much so
we settled for project 3, creating a website for property rentals. We created a google doc and began listing out our ideas, 
positives and negatives of current websites created for renting properties to prepare for our proposal as wel as the main
components that we need to work on for the website's functionailty.
