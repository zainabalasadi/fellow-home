Group was formed. Project 1 was most preferable with the group, but I was not confident in being able to deliver as much so
we settled for project 3, creating a website for property rentals. We created a google doc and began listing out our ideas, 
positives and negatives of current websites created for renting properties to prepare for our proposal as wel as the main 
components that we need to work on for the website's functionailty.

We had a group meeting and discussed important user stories, the depth of the project, what language we were going to code in
and refined our focus and aim. We decided to change our focus to student accomodations and build a community to help them share
flats. We looked at competing competitors and discussed about the advantages and disadvantages of each system. We set roles
for each person for the proposal and made a deadline to have everyone finish their parts by next week.

We all managed to get our parts of the proposal done. I helped out with the epic stories as well as writing up the background.
We all collaborated our work through Google Doc so that we could all work together simultaneously. Once finalised we decided to
have another group meeting to talk about our sprints and what we were going to get done by the next week. It was confirmed to
get a base for the backend and have a bit of the frontend done, with testing done throughout.
