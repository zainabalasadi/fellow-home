# Week 01
Group was formed. Discussing with the team, we decided to go with project 4 as the scope of the project best fit all the
team member's skills and areas of expertise. I created a shared Google Drive folder where we will store and collaborate on
documents. I also created a Facebook group to communicate with the team. During the lab, we made a list of all the features
we would need to build for the project. I formed the basic files of the GitHub project (such as the README and student 
diaries) and the kanban board for storing all our user stores. I also scheduled a meeting with the team for the following 
week.

# Week 02
In this week, we met up to refine our system scope. We came up with a variety of ideas but ended up deciding on a student 
accommodation site for finding potential housemates as we saw a business opportunity in this area. We then assigned each 
team member to a specific role. I nominated to be the general developer and UX/UI designer. We also discussed the language
and software APIs we will be using to develop the website. Additionally, we assigned each person to a specific section of 
the report. I nominated to work on the epics/user stories, the system modules and flow, team skills + project choice, the
bibliography as well as the formatting of the final document. At the end of the week, I contributed 30 user stories to the
GitHub kanban board.

# Week 03
This week, our team spent a majority of our time working on the project proposal that was due this week. Following the
plan we made last week, my key priorities were writing up the project choice and team skills section, completing the user
interface and system flow section as well as completing a section of the user stories and background. I also completed the 
bibliography and formatting of the document. After submission of the proposal, we had a quick call with the team to
discuss the next steps forward. These were to get started on the back-end as soon as possible as well as begin to create 
the interface design, which is my responsibility.

# Week 04
Since the proposal is done, we have began working on the back-end and front-end of the system. I volunteered to work on the
user interface and UI components for the system. I am currently working on these components and will be set to complete
them the following week. During the tutorial, I also began creating a basic UML Class diagram with the team so that we all
have a clear idea of what to program. We also split tasks that we needed to complete for the next two weeks. I am in charge 
of the initial interface design and dummy front end whilst the rest of the team is in charge of the back-end. We also 
scheduled a meeting for next week so we can all catch up on each others progress.

# Week 05
This week, I continued working on the user interface and experience. This involved drawing very low-fidelity wireframes on 
paper and then translating them to high-fidelity interfaces using Figma and Material Design guidelines. So far, I have 
completed the Login, Sign up, Guest homepage, Registered-user homepage, saved listings, messages, seach and refining search,
profile views (both own and other users) and editing profile screens. I have also developed a preliminary list of all the
questions and information requests needed from the user when listing a new spot. I have left this flow and interface for last
as it is the most crucial. After the final interface is completed, I have been allocated the responsibility of implementing
this interface into the system.

# Week 06
This week, we held a meeting to update each other on our progress. Both Anna and William have been working on the back-end
and have recently merged their work into the master branch. During this meeting, we made some paper wireframes for the
interface and discussed how we would handle exceptions and error messages. During the tutorial this week, we presented our
UI/UX to Ali and recieved some great feedback to push the project to the next level. I also created a new github project and
opened various issues and assigned them to each person with a due date so that the interface can be developed in an organised
manner. Towards the end of the week, I spent my time learning more about React and JSX which allowed me to create the grid
uploaded the svg icons and favicons to the front-end branch.
