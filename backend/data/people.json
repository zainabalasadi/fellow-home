Honestly, I am a very tidy and extremely respectful person that you will ever know. I am an easy-going person, I love to hang out with people on Friday night and at the weekend. Bar, club, restaurant? It doesn't matter for me as long as we grab a glass of wine or champagne. Other places are super fine because I'd love to explore new places, so why not. However, I am looking for a single room (if it is not expensive), a share-room is super fine as long as it is a tidy and respectful roommate. If you want a super nice roommate, I am the one you are looking for. Please, don't hesitate to ask if you want to know more about me. Hope to hear from you- Ciaooo!!!!. Best regards, Jacky.",

At the moment we are looking at a budget of $300-400 per person per week, and ideally each person would have their own private room. We are aiming to sign a lease by the end of august/start of September. \n\nWho are we?\nI am a 25 year old Australian from Perth and Ben is 29 year old from France. We are both working professionals in the tech/finance industry. Very easy going people who like to socialise but also enjoy our own space. We can generally get along with anyone as we are friendly and laid back. Weekdays we are both pretty busy at work and afterwards sometimes exercise. \n\nWe are looking for people who enjoy having a chat and are open to socialising, in and outside of the house. Saying that we also respect each others space. I am fine with having people over and meeting your friends and we would also like to be able to have our friends over as long as it does not disrupt anyone. \n\nJust a few ground rules for the house, keep the communal areas nice and tidy. We are not total neat freaks but we just think it\u2019s important to keep some order. That being said happy throw a real party once every now and then (without losing our deposit).\n\nHappy to meet you if you are serious about living with us. Let\u2019s have a beer together and go from there! PM if interested.\n\nPS: We already have a few houses that we have our eyes on and a few inspections coming up next week. You\u2019re more than welcome to come along to these as well!\n",

    "description": "Hello, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Uri.  A pleasure to meet you! I am in my early 30's, originally from Canada. I moved to Australia (Gold Coast) five years ago to study law and immerse myself in the Aussie culture. Needless to say, I fell in love with Australia, its people, and natural landscapes. I recently completed my education and presently looking at Sydney as a future place of living.\r\n\r\nHaving grown up in a European home,  cleanness, tidiness and hygiene are extremely important to me. I love food, meditating and exploring new places. However, also appreciate a quiet time at home UNDISTURBED, CALM, PEACEFUL, TRANQUIL ENVIRONMENT with no loud noises or unnecessary interruptions. I DON'T DRINK generally, rarely socially, prefer housemates who are not into drinking and/or smoking. Undisturbed sleep is VERY IMPORTANT to me (i.e., noise from television, constant music, especially after 10 PM, constant visitors, would not work for me). If you want to party, by all means go for it..., just do it AT THE CLUB.  I have no interest in being someone's mother, maid or cook. Accordingly, common areas would need to be kept clean by some sort of mutual arrangement or agreed upon schedule (i.e., floor/carpets, bathroom/s if not your own, kitchen, rubbish). I can be fun to be around and love a nice captivating chat over coffee, however, pillow talk - probably not so much, time &amp; place. :) At the end of the day, this is a business arrangement and it's in everyone's interest to maintain and keep an environment that is cohesive, considerate of personal space and amicable for all tenants. Zero tolerance for mind games, passive-aggressive behaviour or deflection of responsibilities. \r\n\r\nI also understand that this is a two-way interaction and where comfort, familiarity and trust are essential. Accordingly, I invite you to call me via phone/skype/zoom/facetime to have a chat and to ask me any questions, to see if this arrangement would be of interest to us both.\r\n\r\nInitially, my preference would be to commit to 2 to 4 weeks (NO BOND) to test it out. If everything runs smoothly, happy to extend and negotiate rental term on a more permanent basis. I am willing to provide Australian national police clearance certificate as well as rental/character references.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read my intro and I look forward to speaking with you.\r\n",

I will be studying at UNSW for 5 months, for which I am moving to Sydney in the second week of August till mid-January 2020. I am looking for a room in a shared house preferably close to university or Coogee beach. Now a bit about me!.. I am very sociable, I am used to share the house with other people and I like to create good relationships with my flatmates but I also understand that everyone needs his/her space in the house to just relax. I am very tidy and respectful, I hate to have discussions and I'd rather talk about any misunderstanding to keep a good vibe in the house. I love cooking so if you want to try some nice Italian food you have found the right flatmate!! :D I also like to \"try\" to be fit and I am dreaming of waking up in the morning for a run on an Australian beach!

All this hard work means that I like to sit down and have a fun relaxing chat every now and then. Admittedly, I'm not home all that often. However, when I am I like to cook new foods, whilst making sure the kitchen isn't left in a state. I love to get out and explore during weekends. I'm interested in pretty much everything except for heavy metal and gherkins. I'm half South African and half Spanish, so if you're from there too, HOLA! I enjoy meeting people from different cultures and intently listening to their stories. I like to rollerskate, pet all the dogs and joke around most of the time. Despite being easy-going and playful I will always pay the bills on time (if not in advance) and treasure the happiness of my housemates and myself. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I work in Sydney's CBD so a place that's close to Museum station/Surry Hills/Central is preferable. \r\n\r\nExcited to join a happy home, message me if you're looking for a chill easygoing roommate who isn't a slob and will respect your boundaries and privacy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

So basically, I just need a room to store my belongings and spend the occasional night at home for when I don\u2019t have any house sitting jobs booked. I will barely be at home!  ",

I'm a GP, so that means pretty much Monday to Friday, with the odd early and late, and occasional weekend shift.  Its just me looking for a room, ensuite would be amazing but not essential. My work is in Kirrawee - I dont mind a commute though for the right place. I'm very tidy and considerate. I have house shared in Sydney before and it was amazing, and I made some great friends that way too. So I'd like someone who doesnt mind hanging out and having a catch up and a drink too and watching rubbish TV, but also respects privacy too.  I'm a terrible cook but am trying to get better!  To relax I like reading, music, pubs (less clubs these days), I love squash and kayaking. Oh and I love coffee.  I am a single gay guy.  I dont have any preference in terms of sexuality of my future housemates, as long as they dont have any issues with mine.  Any questions, get in touch! ",

Some of Jaz's hobbies include going to the gym, walking her Mums dog, looking at dog videos online and pole dancing!\r\nLuke works full time in the construction industry as a technical estimator (fancy!). Luke loves keeping fit and active, is an awesome skateboarder and ocassionally goes to the gym when Jaz drags him along. \r\nBoth of us are fun and easy-going and have that classic British banter. We are both *fairly* spiritual, absolutely adore animals (therefore both vegetarians) and love discussing the universe and everything weird and wonderful. We both love to socialise, meet new people, get the drinks in, go to festivals etc but we also love having time to ourselves and respect everybodys personal space/time. :D on the weekdays we're both chill because of work/ui commitments. \r\nWe're new to Sydney so we don't know many people here (apart from Jaz's mum who lives in Newtown :P), we're hoping to flat/house share in the Newtown area with likeminded people who like the occasional sesh but are also chilled out and respectful of space - all about that balance!\r\n\r\n**As per the above - we are flexible with move in date and length of stay.

I have played and travelled with soccer professionally for the last 10 years, in the US, Iceland, Sweden, South East Asia and now in Australia:)\r\nWe are both consciously aware of peoples space and privacy when living together. Always clean and tidy with respect for others. Generally when at home we will be found relaxing. \r\n",

Love hanging at home with a glass of wine too. I keep to myself quite a lot but also love a good chat with the housemates or hanging out on the odd occasion :)\r\nI also have a 7yr old cat who has lived with me in many sharehouses and she is a super shy cat, toilet trained and mainly hangs outside in the sun if there is the opportunity.

I am quiet and keep to myself. I'll be just staying the night, using the bathroom, and maybe the kettle/coffee machine and microwave. \r\n\r\nBasic needs are:\r\n\r\n- A small, private room (Will need hold a single or double sized bed, small desk and a chair. Furnished would be great but I'm able to supply if unfurnished)\r\n- A spot to park my car (On street is fine if it is free)\r\n- Access to a bathroom (Shared is fine, ensuite better)\r\n- Able to use the kitchen as needed (But I probably won't leave much food there except for coffee and tea)\r\n- Internet included\r\n\r\nI would be ideally suited to someone wanting to lease a room, but reluctant to have a full time housemate! I won't tell you if I am coming and going through the week, but I'll give you a heads up if I am going to be there on weekends, so you will really get quiet time on those days. \r\n\r\nI love dogs (my fur baby will be staying in Newcastle with my other housemate), but I am sadly allergic to cats. \r\n\r\nI will be ready to pay a bond and move in immediately, and can come down to Sydney this weekend (27-28 July) to meet and inspect.",

I have lived with other people and on my own so I'm comfortable with meeting new people and living with others.\r\n\r\nMy interests include hiking, trying new cafes and restaurants, cooking, baking and reading. I like drinking bubble tea and can give you top recommendations. \r\n\r\nWell, me as a flatmate - I'm easy going. I like to think that whoever I end up living with will be my friend/s. My job can be demanding at times so I normally tend to keep to myself after work. I do like chatting but I also respect other people's boundaries. I'm generally neat and tidy. I may leave a pan in the sink overnight. \r\n\r\nIdeally I'm looking for a room with space for a study desk, and my own bathroom. It can be unfurnished as I have bedroom furniture. I am flexible on the bathroom situation. I also have a car and would like an off-street parking place. Airconditioning in the room would be very nice since I do shift work and sleeping in the day time during summer is too hard for me. \r\n\r\nIf you want to know anything else about me, just let me know.\r\n",

Looking for a group of flatmates who are kind, respectful, relaxed, clean, and prefer laughter often. \r\n\r\n*Also have an Air BnB for the first week I land so won't be ready to move in until August 14th*",

Either all female or mixed. Communication with housemates about things happening in the house is key.\r\n- Need my own bedroom, but will happily share all other spaces.\r\n- A reasonable level of personal freedom (including not being bullied with religion and my partner of 5 years being allowed to visit and stay over - past experience tells me I need to specify this, apparently).\r\n- Landlord approval to temporarily house contained injured wildlife (as a WIRES volunteer)\r\n- Space for my 9 year old border collie, Bonaparte. He is currently used to being made to live outside by family, but flexibility on this would be nice, especially as he ages. He loves all people but is iffy with other dogs.\r\n- Move in date ASAP\r\n",

Prior to that I studied, lived and worked all over the US for about 13 years.  I also spent a few years of high school in boarding schools in Africa.  I am migrating permanently to Australia because of its legendary beaches, green spaces, quality of life, the respect for a healthy work life balance, and the wonderful attitude of the people here that exemplifies the Australian way of life. I enjoy the outdoors, swimming, running, working out, hiking, trekking, the beach and checking out new cafes, pastry shops, and restaurants.  \r\nI'll likely be studying and working pretty much most of the time and would need and offer a quiet, peaceful, respectful and clean cohabitation experience. I don't drink, smoke, play loud music or even watch TV, but have no problems if anyone/everyone else does, within reasonable levels of noise and hygiene.  I have cohabited with folks from all over the world since I was in high school through my professional career.

I'm 33 years old, super friendly and bubbly, easy to live with because I enjoy my own space and quiet time, but am social and very happy to have a chat and a glass of wine at the end of the day.\r\n\r\nI'm very tidy, clean and respectful, I have shared with housemates for years now. I work Mon-Fri 9-5pm in fashion wholesale and am out and about a bit, doing dance classes and catching up with friends, but don't mind a good old TV binge session on a lazy weekend.\r\n\r\nI prefer to socialise while out and about, home tends to be a sanctuary for me so I wouldn't be having guests over.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a happy home, with considerate people who are of a similar mindset :)",

    "description": "Hi Sydney!\r\n\r\nMy name is Neatsy and I\u2019m currently looking for a place in Rozelle/Balmain and the inner west in general.  I work in Balmain and ride a bike to work so it's pretty easy for me to get anywhere as I don't have to worry about traffic or public transport too much! \r\n\r\nI'm also looking for a place I can stay for at least 6 months and hopefully longer as it would be nice to settle somewhere and call it home. \r\n\r\nI have a 6 year old beagle called Juno so hopefully you love floppy eared fur balls. Juno is a bundle of love and definitely an indoor dog but is happy sniffing/sleeping outside when i'm not home. I also have an extremely trustworthy dog walker I have been using since early 2017 and he and his company (Mad dogs &amp; Englishmen) really help me out when I need it. Juno sleeps in my room and is toilet trained, on flea prevention, de-wormers and is fully vaccinated. I can also provide references on request from veterinarians and previous house mates.\r\n\r\nI have been working at a Veterinary Clinic the past few years and just have my exams to sit until I become a qualified veterinary nurse. \r\n\r\nI did a brief stint in Newcastle and Aberdeen and just moved back to Sydney a few weeks ago. I have started working in 2 cafes in the area since and really enjoy it. It\u2019s a full-time job and they are always morning to afternoon shifts so I\u2019ll be around in the evening for a chat or anything really. \r\n\r\nI took up yoga about 6 months ago and have since fallen in love with it. I was a runner but had to give it up due to constant injury. It was a shame but I\u2019m lucky I found something I enjoy just as much.\r\n\r\nI'm a super chilled and friendly person to live with and really like socialising. I also like reading, cooking vegetarian meals, bush walking, playing and listening to music, of course spending quality time with my Dog and I LOVE dancing. \r\n\r\nI think it is also important to say that I hope to share a house hold with people who are environmentally conscious, LGBTQI friendly, like a relatively clean environment and a good chat. I plan on finishing my environmental management degree at some point in the next few years but for now just want to enjoy life as I\u2019ve been studying almost full time for years!\r\n\r\nI\u2019m giving myself a bit of time to find the right home and am hoping to have found a place by end of September/ early October, however I also know it can be a challenge finding a place that is pet friendly! I\u2019m hoping to find not just a house but a new circle of friends as I think it is so important to make a share house as comfortable as possible for everyone.\r\n\r\nIf you made it through then thanks for reading this huge bio.\r\n\r\nNeats and Juno :)\r\n\r\n****I would also love a balcony again. I had one in my room in Rozelle a few years back and it was awesome! :D",

I will not be hosting parties, I'm going to be very tired, antisocial, boring and I'm going need my personal space which is why I need the room to be isolated and have my own kitchen and bathroom.\r\n\r\nIf you have an apartment that meets my requirements for rent in or surrounding Sydney, please can you message me with an answer to the following questions:\r\n\r\nIs there a gym near your apartment? (Fitness is my main hobby and I do plan to try and squeeze as much of it in as I can between working two jobs)\r\nIs the room soundproof/ thick walled/ well isolated?\r\nIs there a Coles, Aldi or Woolworths in the area?\r\nWill it be available on 31st August?\r\nDoes the apartment come with sufficient Wifi?\r\nI do plan on getting a car asap upon arrival too, so somewhere (even if it's street parking) is going to be essential.\r\n\r\nPlease reply with answers to the questions as I am very keen to get settled asap upon arrival to Sydney 31st August.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

I like laughing, learning new stuff -not related to what I do- and taking responsibility for myself. If I f/d up something, I take feedback and do my best to fix situations within my reach. I do not drink (much, if any) but people think that I do because I am always laughing and truly enjoying myself around people who do.\r\n\r\nI love human connection and I am a people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s person. I'm single (lesbian), enjoy some solitude time and respect when others need it too. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also up for in-home bbq, dinners with friends, and 'real Mexican food nights' although despite my Latino blood, my never-ending \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfiesta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 years are long gone.\r\n\r\nHalf of the week I'm a research fellow on cybersecurity and human behaviour. The other half I am in my office in Barangaroo (CBD) or somewhere interstate working with individuals, business and CEOs in need of help to manage change. I finished my PhD recently and now working on getting my Australian registration as a Psychologist. Occasionally I like to work from home. \r\n\r\nI like eating healthy food, as in, I have a legendary Mexican nutritionist who helps me to keep crap food out of sight and an exercise routine, so my Latin hips do not lie. I truly enjoy cooking and making those food plans. I also love road cycling and I try to go for long rides as frequent as possible.\r\n\r\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m looking to share a home with people who -like me- have a joy for what they do. That are up for occasional meal share, chats, and laughter; team players who are responsible and clean. Family vibes and cute doggies will be an ultra plus!",

We really do respect other's privacy, their own space/time. We're a laidback and super tidy couple. We used to rent our own apartment, we knew how does it feel and how things should work out. We keep things clean because we like to feel like a HOME, not backpacker hotels. \r\n\r\nWe moved to Sydney because of my studying. So, we're looking for a sharehouse where we could relax after study and work. We like to stay with max 4 person in the house. We speak English, also practicing English if you don't mind having a slow discussion with us, we like to chat, that's the only way to practice our English.\r\n\r\nOkay, let's get down to business. ;) \r\n\r\nI\u2019m Tim Tawan, 28 years old, Thai. I am studying a master of software engineering. I am working part-time as a remote software developer for two startup companies in Australia and Thailand. During my spare time, I usually enjoy food prep, gym, and reading and watch movies. But most of the time, I'll be busy with work during the weekdays. \r\n\r\nMy girlfriend, she also Thai, 29 years old. She works as a receptionist, she studying English and cooking. Her free time, she like cooking and baking. If you don\u2019t mind, she also has a mixer for the bakery with her. And she might bake sometimes too, \r\n\r\nWe are super tidy, we are not party person, we keep things nice and clean, especially social area, kitchen and toilet. We respect other privacy\u2019s. We are an easy-going and hard worker. We also enjoy having a chat with housemates, have dinner and not drink that often, but we can enjoy a couple of glass of wines. We like to cook together, make healthy food (sometimes), most of the time, we cook Thai food, we happy to share dinner with you, that's part of our culture. So, don't be worry to join the dinner with us.\r\n\r\nIf you are happy for us to live with you, I am in Sydney now, please text me to arrange the inspection time.\u00a0Thank you.",

    "description": "Hello! So, little about me. I'm 29 years old and work for a fin-tech in the city full time. As much as a love my job, coffee is in my blood and is what keeps me going. I sometimes work long hours and I\u2019ve been known to grab a cheeky bev after work with the work crew. Having said that\u2019s I generally like to keep it low key. I'd be keen for Mexican Mondays, Teppanyaki Tuesdays or even Fruit Loop Fridays. Basically, a house where I can socalise with the rest of the housemates. On the weekends, I enjoy a sleep in &amp; brunches (by the end of the year, my goal is to find French Toast that makes me pass out from sheer joy), but would still be up for housemate hangs. I've got family &amp; friends who live down the coast, so there would also be weekends you won't see me.\r\nAlso recently tried to get back to that #fitnesslyf, so someone who likes to hit the gym would be good (to keep me motivated and accountable cause god knows, I like a burger or two and need to work hard to earn it!)",

I appreciate art, film and culture and am looking for someone who shares similar values. \r\n\r\nAbove all, I'm a mature, courteous, laid-back guy and I get along easily with anyone.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nElliot",

I have never lived anywhere where someone had a problem with me but I have moved because of these issues! Not looking for a party flat but don't mind if you throw one every so often and clean up after yourself. I love nature but equally love the city, LOVE animals! If you have a pet that is a big plus. I don't party often but when I do it is outside as I am time poor and really love my field. :P Any questions don't hesitate to ask! I don't want to move around so looking for a long term 6 months +",

This is Big move for me from regional NSW, and initially I\u2019m just after some temporary accommodation for no more than 3 to maybe 6 months while I determine which locale best suits me for work. Flexibility is important.  \r\n\r\nMy partner will eventually move up too, but meanwhile she will stay back in our old place packing and organising (yes I\u2019m \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08). We have 2 dogs (one very old little terrier X and a pure bred kelpie with a grin that melts your heart!) These two will visit occasionally with my partner, so the space needs to be pet friendly. We also have other animal family members - 2 cats, they however, won\u2019t visit, neither will our 2 horses! Our goal is eventually to find our own space that will accommodate us all, so it\u2019s really just me who\u2019ll be bunking with you. \r\n\r\nI am a Health Practitioner, I will be working long hours. I love having space to myself, yet enjoy a happy banter over a glass of wine. \r\nI am very environmentally conscious, enjoy watching Netflix, exercising and practicing meditation and yoga from home. I enjoy utilising the kitchen, so a good cooking space is essential. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m not interested in a party house at all, those days are long gone! Just other peaceful, professional people, would be ideal. \r\n\r\nFeel free to message me to ask anything I haven\u2019t covered. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

I have been house sharing for over 7 years and am very accustomed to sharing a house with many others. I am respectful of people\u2019s space, belongings, lives and how they like their living spaces. I am fairly laid back when it comes to living situations, however I do appreciate a home that is tidy, respectful , stress and drama free.  I'd love a house that can be made a home and someone who is happy to make a home with me, my dog and potentially another housemate. \r\nI'm not opposed to the occasional gathering of friends, in fact i'd love it if we had a home that was open to entertaining, however, it's something that is within reason and respectful of other housemates plans - open communication is key. \r\n\r\nI have a dog jax, he is pretty cool. He\u2019s a daschallier, goes for runs, hangs out and is pretty much low maintenance. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m on the hunt for a house that is roughly $200-300 per week , pets allowed, is nice and a house mate who is not too awkward, clean, respectful and yeah  :) \r\n\r\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to discuss further or want to grab a coffee and look at some places :) \r\n\r\nGabbi ",

The top priority is the happiness of my dogs - I have 3 small cavalier king charles spaniels aged 4, 6 and 7. They are like little love sponges - they're very sweet, well trained and placid. They are indoor dogs and sleep on the bed with me, sit on the lounge etc and are treated like family. I have lived in 2 different rentals the entire time I've had them and bond has always been returned in full. I am going through a break up so now needing my own place. \r\n\r\nIs there anything out there for us? Would love a granny flat, studio or room from Penrith to mid-Blue Mountains for 12 months+.
