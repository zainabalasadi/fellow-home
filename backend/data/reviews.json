Although the hotel is at the beginning of the strip it is easy access as there is a free monorail to take you to Luxor and excalibur which drops you at the main intersection of all the action. The rooms are just as nice as the 5 star Venetian and Palazzo. If you would like to have a quieter experience try Thehotel at Mandalay Bay it is much more adult oriented and is attached to Mandalay Bay. All the rooms at Thehotel are suites and are right in line with the Venetian and the Palazzo very nicely done and quiet. As I said I seem to always end up back at the Mandalay Bay property. Of course we all have a bad experience now and then but over all Mandalay Bay has addressed any issue and has corrected the situation."

After being let off by the shuttle on the bottom floor it was a bit confusing as to how to get to the registration desk. Onuce at the registration area, there was a line to check in. I would say I was about the 20th person in line. It took about 15mins before i got to the front. That was pretty good compared to other places I've stayed where I was 5th in line and it took 20min before it was my turn. Since i was here fir a cinference i didnt get to take in all the amenities, but overall the price was reasonable for all that is available. I would recommend."

    "content": "The Mandalay Bay is a beautiful property, and I really liked our room. Everything was cleaned very well, so kudos to the housekeeping staff. One huge negative was the thin walls and the tolerance Mandalay has for LOUD guests. I understand Vegas is the Party Capital of the world, but there is no excuse for loud music and loud talking/laughing at 5:30 am! After we called security a grand total of 3 times, nothing was done. My husband actually stopped the problem by calling the room next door multiple times and just sitting there on the phone. (The idiots didn't even think to unplug the phone, LOL!) They got paranoid and thought it was their parents calling them! The noise stopped immediately. I had to fly home early to get back to work, but my husband stayed there the rest of the week for his conference. He heard another couple being drunk and loud the next night. (He could totally hear their conversation- they were cheating on their spouses with each other!) He tried his multiple calls to the room again, and the lady thought it was her HUSBAND checking up on her! Again, the noise stopped. My advice is that if early morning noise (we're talking 5:30-6:00 am) bothers you and your traveling companions, you might choose to stay somewhere a little quieter. Otherwise, if noise isn't a big deal, we liked Mandalay Bay."

The monorail is located in the MGM which is about a 10-15 minute walk away. We took that one day on a $12 24-hour pass to see the rest of the strip. I would probably stay here again if there is a special rate, but I would probably pick something more in the middle of the strip if the price is comparable."

The casinio is laid out with plenty of room and not many of the usual twists and turns so it is hard to get lost. The pool is one of the best in Vegas but a long hike from your room. The view from the top in the Foundation Room is great (if you can get in). The exhibit on the Titanic at the Luxor should not be missed...the largest and best of original items brought up from the ocean floor on this 100th anniversary of the sinking. Check in and check out were very easy and the personnel are friendly with a multitude of places to eat - most are on the high side for Vegas....makes up for the relatively inexpensive rooms."

The pool area was VERY nice ~ but not sure why they charge so much for 2 chaise lounges with an umbrella ~ $150?!?

For a Vegas Virgin, it was a nice refuge being on the end of the strip after the crowds farther in. We used the tram, monorail and buses to get up and down the strip. Plan your day with transportation in mind because it takes a long time to get anywhere in Vegas due to having to walk through all of the casinos, take all of the escalators, and beat all of the crowds. The meals we had at the sushi place and the Irish Pub were excellent and catered to our teen son's peanut allergy.

    "content": "We recently spent a night at Mandalay Bay and were very satisfied with the accommodations and the property in general. It is easy to get to Mandalay Bay if you are coming in on I-15 from the south, you can just take the exit for Frank Sinatra drive and that will take you right to their parking garage. When you leave the garage you just have to go to Las Vegas Blvd for a little ways and take Russell Road back to the interstate. The location is south of the main action on the Strip, but they have a free tram that will take you to Excalibur and get you to the casinos near Tropicana Avenue. You can also go upstairs from the casino floor and take a short walk through a corridor of shops and go over to the Luxor. The property has several restaurants, some shopping, a nice size casino and a few other attractions; so you don\u2019t really need to leave Mandalay Bay if you are just staying for a short time. We had a room with a very comfortable king bed on the 11th floor. It was very nice even though it was one of the smallest rooms that they offer, but at 550 square feet it was much larger than some of the rooms that you will find in many of the other strip hotels. The floor to ceiling windows provide for a lot of natural light and probably some good strip views in some rooms; we were facing west so we didn\u2019t have much of a view, but that wasn\u2019t a big deal to us. The room layout did waste some space as there is a long entry hall into the room, but still you have a nice size area of usable space. The bathroom was a nice size also with a small tub and separate shower as well as a double sink. All of our contact with the staff before and during our stay was very pleasant and positive. However, there is one onerous thing about this property and it is that they have the obnoxious \u2018resort fee\u2019 which they have just raised to a ridiculous $25 per night. This doesn\u2019t do much for me except provide \u2018free\u2019 wireless internet which worked well, but which should, in my opinion, be standard with any room. Tacking on the $25 per night fee, you can still get a room for a little over $100 per night during slow weeks and somewhat higher on weekends. But shop around and if you can get a better deal at a property that doesn\u2019t have the additional fee I would take it so that MGM-Mirage may eventually get the message regarding the traveling public\u2019s disdain for these additional fees. (By the way we were staying on a Comp night or I probably wouldn\u2019t pay to stay at an MGM-Mirage property because of this fee). Bottom line is that this is a great property even though it is a little ways from the main strip action. If you can get a good rate considering the resort fee, just hold your nose and pay the extra fee and you should have a nice experience."

This is an annual trip that my friends from college and I take every Spring, so the review is based on a group of guys who care more about staying up all night, drinking as much as possible, and gambling. We aren't there to sleep. I'll break the review down into parts: The Room: We had two standard double rooms, right across from each other. I am a smoker, so we got a smoking room and a non-smoking room. Nobody complained, it's Vegas. The room had an iPod docking station, which was very nice. The bathroom was huge and comfortable, and we had absolutely no complaints with the size or cleanliness of the room. Housekeeping serviced us daily, and never interuppted our rest. Overall, this was the nicest room I have had out of several properties I've stayed at on and off the Vegas strip. The Hotel: The hotel offered above standard amenities. In addition, we were waived our resort fee because we played plenty at MGM resorts during our stay. However, we were well aware of this fee. Some advice, book over the phone or call after to get an out the door cost. Or, gamble daily and you will see some comps thrown your way. The pool was another outstanding feature. We went for one day, and there were plenty of chairs available. The restaurant by the pool was also a great place to eat outdoors. The Casino: I was not a fan of the Casino compared to other properties. I thought it was a bit dull and boring, and dealers were not exceptionally friendly. We generally played elsewhere including Luxor, Excaliber, and NYNY. We found much better dealers and a lot more energy on the casino floor. The Nigtlife: The Foundation Room is, in my opinion, the best view in Vegas. Here's some advice for getting in without reservations/a cover. We went in around 9:00 PM to have a few drinks before heading over to the Palms to hit all of their clubs, which is an annual tradition. We were dressed up - nice pants, nice shoes, pressed shirts, etc. We simply asked the security guard at the door if we could go up and have a few drinks while taking in the view. He just let us right in. We spent about 2 hours on the patio, enjoying some cigars and cocktails. Then, another employee gave us a tour of all of the private rooms. He was very nice, so we tipped him. We also tipped the door guard on the way out as a thank you, and he invited us back any time. If you act classy in Vegas, expect to get most of what you want just by asking. The club was hands down the best part of Mandalay Bay The Location: It's the last hotel at the South end... So getting to Caesar's, etc. is a hike. However, we either used the tram up to Excaliber, or took a cab or limo. Yes, it cost some money, but who cares? My only real criticism of this property is that the casino is just so dull. My friend hit on roulette for a significant amount of money... Actually, very significant, and that was the most excitement I saw out of any player during our trip."

This was true for 3 nights in a row (I have no idea why they don't go out!). I complained to the hotel and the hotel warned them. But, the warnings really did not help. I guess the hotel could have suggested moving me to another room but they did not. The hotel needs a better policy to deal with noise."

Food at the convention was the best we've had at any of the 5 years and the convention rooms were comfortable. Even though we had to stand in line for about 45 minutes to check in, the hotel did have a smooth process and people walking around handing out waters and a nice live band to listen to. If there was some effort put into the upkeep of the rooms, this would be an excellent place to stay."

Wouldn't have bothered to comment , but they tried to rip me off at checkout. I was in a hurry to check out, so I used their express checkout where they are supposed to send you the bill by email after you leave. I had to send a couple emails to even get the bill , and when I received it they had added a $50 charge for Tequila from the mini-bar. I never touched the mini-bar --- Since they didn't voluntarily send me the room bill and the charge was \"inadvertently added\" --my only thought was that they added the charge intentionally with the hope that I wouldn't catch it. . While managment quickly corrected the bill when I called them on it, I wonder how many others have had this experience. Word to the wise, check out in person and check the bill carefully !"

Found that this resort was too far from the main strip (this resort is right at the very end of the strip) and had to take a rail car to the next resort, get off and walk quite a way to get onto the main strip. Don't mind walking but our feet were very sore by the time we got back to our room. Will definitely go back to Las Vegas, but will stay on the main strip at a resort closer to everything and not have to walk so far. Lots to see in Las Vegas, and my husband and I both love to walk, but by the time you got to the main strip from this resort and walked the strip, you wanted to catch a cab back, which we did a few times. Also, there was no place to sit outside of the resort, no benches, only place to sit was down by the beach area. Looking at going back to Vegas in April or May of 2012, and will definitely stay on the main strip. Hoping to see the Hoover Dam and Grand Canyon this time, hopefully weather will be less cold and windy."

Both check in and checkout had a wait time of under 1 minute (yes ONE minute), they were also accommodating with a late check out and gave us 2 extra hours on check out day. Loved the spacious room, deep bathtub and TV in the bathroom. Got to take a nice bubble bath and watch TV after a long day in the casino. The view and floor to ceiling windows were also lovely. It's close to Excalibur and Luxor and offers a tram between the 3, however it is not in the \"center\" of things so don't try to walk to center hotels, just take your own car or a cab. Would definitely stay here again and plan to on my next trip to Vegas. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that the bathtub was a little dusty, I had to wash it myself with some soap and hot water before using it. The rest of the room was clean and lovely."

The bathroom was great, separate tub and shower, 2 sinks ( no waiting). The room was clean and not dated, Everyone on the staff we had interaction with was friendly and helpful, We are not beach people but that beach was impressive. We ate at the Bayside buffet for both breakfast and dinner. It was good, not as good as the MGM grands buffet we had in the past, but not bad. Others have complained about the resort fee and I would agree, Lots of places offer the same services included in the room rate, but the resort fee seems to be the way it is in Vegas. The location isn't bad but being at the end of the strip there is a little more walking involved to get to some of the other casinos. Overall we were very happy with the stay and will stay again if we get back to Vegas."

There is a free tram from Mandalay Bay to the Excalibur, but it hardly makes a difference. The walking, even in comfortable shoes and being in really good shape, was just too much. We made it down to Ceasars Palace and almost collapsed. There is no point in trying to take taxi's, as the traffic on the strip is always rediculous.

Everything became outdated and was rubbed. Attractiveness and brightness were gone. Even the towels are aged with the pillows, blanket and carpet. Maybe freshly brewed coffee will correct picture? Unfortunately the coffee maker hasn't been provided by administration."

We were there 3 days and I never once left the hotel until I left for the airport to come home. The rooms are big, clean, modern and comfortable. Great bathroom/shower. The Magic Carpet ride green screen video in the Luxor hotel that is attached through the Shoppes area is great. If you want to make a very funny Vegas Memory go to the Luxor and make one of the videos, you will laugh over it for years. We were in a team building challenge and the owner of this business really helped us out. Go get your video made, you will not regret it. i've stayed in the Bellagio, Venetian, the Rio and a few others,. I like the Mandalay Bay the best. Although the Bellagio and Venetian are \"nicer\" hotels, Mandalay Bay had great restaurants and affordable drinks at the bars. The cardio gym was included at no cost, which is a plus. The biggest drawback is that the Mandalay Bay is the farthest hotel from the rest of the strip, it is not very close to many of the other large hotels/Casinos."

No news paper on weekends. Wireless access is to slow to use, room eithernet was ok. No access to aquarium included. Rooms are very nice and beat expectations. Tram service was spottie. Closed earlier then posted, and only one tram was running. Food was great at the burger bar. Very good at Housongs. Very good, but over priced at buffett.

There a plenty of places to each shop and wonder, without going to strip. As I am not a smoker, it was nice to be at a hotel in Vegas with little to no smoke in the hotel. This was a major plus for me and my friend. Lastly, being able to walk to a concert/venue and not worry about the freeway traffic or parking, was the best experience of all! Love the hotel and the pricing was reasonable, when using the hotel promotion on their website (extremely helpful). I will definitely go back again, even without the promotion because the experience was well worth it and memorable."

    "content": "The casino area is typical of Vegas with the larger-than-life stimulation overload. The smell of stale cigarette/cigar smoke along with stale booze drove me to my room early. Upon check in, my room was not ready. The hotel front desk clerk cheerfully upgraded me to a \"spa suite\" on the 30th floor. I was told that I would be sent a text message when it was ready, and that it was worth the wait. After waiting around for an hour and 1/2 with no text message, I went back to the front desk to inquire about my room. It was ready, but I'm not sure what happened about the text message I was supposed to get..... but, oh well. The room itself was large and spacious. I liked the set up. The \"spa\" was a jet tub that looked like a good cleaning was due. The shower had dingy grout on the shower floor that looked like a parade of people with extremely dirty feet had been using it for the past 10 years. The base boards in the room and walls were marked up, and there were rings on the tables from where previous guests had set down their drinks. When I used the phone in the room it smelled like a bottle of perfume had been dumped on it. In the bathroom there was something that looked like a dried bit of human-excrement-something (did not get that close to look). I kept wondering if the maid would get a chisel and remove it -- it was there my entire stay as I'm sure it will be there for years to come. I wanted to rip out the carpet because the the pattern was exceedingly ugly and hid dirt well -- I'm sure that's the reason it was selected. Five-Words-Or-Less: Rooms a little tired and dingy for my taste, but not so horrible as to complain to the management."

The staff were ALL very accomodating every time we needed anytime. We ate at HOUSE OF BLUES for breakfast (great food) they give you a buy one get one free for the next morning which is great because the food is expensive in Vegas! The only reason we do not give Mandalay a five star is for location. It is the last hotel on the strip. Although there is a tram very close that takes you a good length, it was closed one weeknight at 10:30 and we were NOT happy about at all. Otherwise, GREAT HOTEL!"

My room was beautiful. $28 \"resort fee\" is ridiculous, I know they all do it but that doesn't make it right. If it were in a better location I might go back in the warmer season and try the pool because I hear it is great. I didn't have any service issues. I tried a few of the restaurants and Lupo was great but the others were just ok. The only place I found to get quick food was the sports book grill and it was just ok.

This stranger was let into my room by hotel security. I cannot even express to all of you how terrifying this situation was and still is. The hotel, Mandalay Bay, has handled this terribly and I will NEVER feel safe staying here again. The hotel was not only completely negligent, but their response has been horrifyingly inappropriate. It took over an hour for anyone from the hotel to come to my room. When I was finally able to reach someone by phone I was told by the Front Desk manager that \u201cit was a mistake, but there is nothing I can do\u201d. In fact, I was on hold for five minutes before I was even connected with Security or the Front Desk. I cannot emphasize enough how scary this situation was and how horrible the response of Mandalay Bay has been. I had the deadbolt was locked and I had the security lock engaged as well. The Security Guard apparently reached in with a tool and undid the security lock and sent this person into my room. You can surely imagine how scared I was to wake up to a stranger standing in my room in the middle of the night and to know that this hotel was COMPLETELY responsible for this is unacceptable. They did not check identification, they did not knock on the door, they did not send the security guard into the room first. None of that happened."

    "content": "I just finished a 3 night/4 day trip to MB Resort. I booked the trip through Southwest Airline Vacations in January so I knew ahead of time that the resort fee was $20.00 per night. Funny how as of 2/13/2012 the fee is now $28.00 per night. I asked the clerk when checking in about the increase and was told it went up in all of their properties. I guess they need to try and make up the loss in revenue from the empty slot machines everywhere. The hotel itself is nice. I had a room on the 9th floor with 2 queen beds that was clean and nicely furnished. The buffet for breakfast was $17.00 and dinner ran about $30.00. I would say the food and service were very good. Check in and check out were easy and without any problems. Some helpful hints: Stay on floors below 9 because the elevators are much faster and easy to access. Take the \"Duce\" buss right outside the hotel. It runs every 10 minutes and costs $7.00 for a 24 hour pass. It will take you to Freemont Street and back all day. We saw Chris Angel next door at the Pyramid hotel. You actually see Chris Angel 60 minutes but you are sitting there for about 90 minutes and had it not been part of my vacation package it would have been a complete rip off. Overall, Las Vegas is fine but I think these resort fees need to be stopped. I think if enough people stop going to these resort fee hotels, the properties will get the hint that its not ok to charge these daily fees and give you very little in return."

The walls as previous reviewers stated are indeed paper thin, I could hear the tv & all of the conversations on the phone and with room service etc; by the guest in adjacent room. So clearly as if they were in my room.! The restaurants/pubs in the Mall very good including Ri Ras which I really enjoyed my fish & chips.

    "content": "As a frequent visitor to Las Vegas, I've stayed in many, many hotels over the years. Lately, I've been receiving some great offers from Mandalay Bay. I had one offer about to expire, my hubby was off Monday and I decided to take 3 nights and have some fun. (And do some work, but not a lot.) I don't know about you, but when I gamble anywhere in Vegas, I sign up for their card that tracks your play. Because I've signed up for so many, I've received free trips to Vegas, free stays in hotels and even certificates to return. I had one offer from the M Life people who own Mandalay bay and MGM Grand, among others, and saw that it was due to expire. I did pick a bad weekend as Tuesday was Valentine's Day and the following Monday was President's Day. Still, I called the number on the offer and was told they could give me the most expensive night (Saturday night) for free! I knew one night was comped but I assumed it would be the cheapest. Nope- they comped my 1st night, which was ridiculously expensive for Mandalay, but all the hotels had increased rates. And MB was the only one who would comp the Saturday. I ended up paying about a third of the regular rate for the following 2 nights. Not bad for a busy weekend, and the airline dropped their rates considerably that last weekend. I was stunned that the woman at casino services (they sent the email) would even find me a room Saturday b/c it was listed as being full. But she did. I had a shock when I took the cab to the hotel. There are 2 types of cabbies in Vegas, the ones who go the RIGHT way to MB and the ones who try to take you for a ride. My cab ride in November cost $11 plus tip! This time it SAID $13 but he told me it was $16. Plus tip. He took me around an area I knew but I also know he took the wrong way. I found the receipt he'd given me as I packed up 3 nights later, and it charged me for $13.40. So, even a seasoned traveler can get \"taken\". I arrived after my long trek to see that the lobby was full! There were a lot of conventions going on and also a lot of partiers and weddings. I recognized some people from my flight and I hadn't even waited for luggage. That meant they DID wait (they had their large bags) and got there before me. Damn driver! GRRRRR. But MB is classy. They had a lady bring bottled water out and within 4 minutes, 4 extra girls came out to help. I got up there pretty fast considering how long that line was. My lady made mistakes. I asked her to put the small amount I owed for 2 of 3 nights on my debit card, and to put the hold for incidentals on my CC. She did NOT put the hold on or did it wrong b/c when I got to my room and was dying of thirst, I couldn't open the minibar. The soda machine on that level did not take dollars and the ice machine was out. So instead of trekking back down for more change, I figured I could pay minibar prices this once. But it wouldn't open. Another thing bothered me. I was invited, and there was a sign for \"invited guests. VIPS\" but I didn't THINK that meant me, So when the woman told me that not only did I not get an upgrade to a suite (normally done if anything is available) but she wasn't giving me a room with a King bed. THAT pissed me off b/c the lady I'd spoken to had said that it wouldn't be a problem- that it was usually more difficult to find 2 queens than a king. The lady checking me in told me that there WERE NO KING beds. NO SUITES. I could check in morning. Okay, it's late, let me go to my room. Let me also say that perhaps she didn't know that there WERE other rooms available. I think she was looking at me getting a free night on a night they were so full and decided that she was going to give me what I paid, which is the lowest room available. I was put on the 7th floor. (Quite low.) No matter- it's what is IN the room that matters. It was 2 older looking beds, and a room that didn't look as if it was used often. In other words, the freebie room. As I couldn't get the ice machine on the floor to work OR the pop machine, THIS is when I broke my NO MINIBAR rule and it wouldn't open. I called down and they said, \"Let me give you to VIP services b/c they arranged this. You should've checked in there.\" Okay. I held a minute and explained that I couldn't open the minibar. The VERY kind young man said that I was a cash account. I HATE that! I'm a lover of Vegas room service (breakfast all day) and always use the spas. I had been very careful about telling the check-in lady that I MUST have my CC on file. I had given them a CC on purpose- so that this wouldn't happen. But the woman had messed up and charged my debit card for the amount due, and the CC was NOT charged for incidentals. Now, some people don't NEED incidentals. I do. WHY she messed up, I don't know. But the new guy, Danny, was an angel. When I said that I was a bit disappointed in the fact that I'd reserved a room with one bed and this is a huge resort, he laughed in a kind way. He said not only did he have a King bed for me, but he had a suite! I wasn't sure what to expect but in 5 minutes they brought the keys and I was moving on up to the 22nd floor! My new room was considered a suite, and I would say it's a \"junior\" suite. People who have read my reviews here and elsewhere know that one of my pet peeves is to call a room a suite. A suite means \"suite of rooms\". But on this night, I didn't care! I'm not sharing so I didn't need a suite. I had the one bed and an extra space by the windows, a comfy couch and the best view I've ever had in Vegas, and that is saying a LOT. It is called a suite at MB and does have lots of room. I not only had my King bed, but the room was so much nicer! I had a jacuzzi in my tub and a corner room that had an area leading to the back with a couch, chair, desk, etc. It was nicer than the spa room I'd had in November and THAT was a nice room. Danny. That kid took a MINUTE to make me happy. A minute! He knew, like many workers know, that your room is the 1st impression you're really given in a hotel. The lobby of a hotel might be gorgeous, but you don't sleep there. Rooms are important. This room allowed me to relax and watch TV without hurting my back laying on the bed too long. Doctors have told me that I shouldn't watch tv from a bed- it's not good for the back. So true. And when the minibar didn't work yet again, Danny sent me a free minifridge. I didn't ask for one, I didn't even mention it. But he said he'd like to do this and I could keep my soda cold. The soda machine worked and the ice machine worked, but I sure liked having that fridge! He made sure I was doing well and liked the suite. Um, yes, I more than liked it. I felt comfortable. I like King beds. I like having a comfy sofa to sit on to watch tv or chat with a pal. And the view was amazing. The room looks out at MGM and I didn't even notice how lovely the view was until I started to take a few pictures. I don't know what type of room/suite this is called, but it may be a corner room version of the Spa suite. That just means the tub has a jacuzzi in it. But it's a lovely jacuzzi and the TV in there is mounted perfected with another remote. One can soak for hours and forget all about the time. They had bath salts and everything- it was quite relaxing. Included in my \"Free night\" deal was $50 Freeplay. That doesn't mean they hand you $50, but you do get to use a video poker or slot machine until that $50 has increased or gone away. As I'm a card girl with no real knowledge of slots and the inability to walk away from video Blackjack when I should, I enjoyed my time but won nothing. But then I found the single deck tables... I visit Vegas quite regularly. When I was last here I left with $20 more than I arrived with and I considered this quite a feat. But when I say that I just couldn't lose, I'm not kidding! I had to leave my table to meet a friend for dinner, and after we ate I sat down at a table there just for 20 minutes and got 7 blackjacks in Double Deck. When my friend got back from getting the parking ticket punched, I had an extra $300 on the table. It was time to go, though I would've stayed all night if she hadn't been my ride! The next day I visited Spa Mandalay. I like this spa and have been here several times. I had a wonderful massage therapist who knew so much about muscles and what they do that I walked out of there feeling like a new woman. I used the jacuzzi, took a shower and got dressed, then back to the room which had been cleaned for the 1st time since I arrived. As I was 1 person, I didn't feel the need to get the room cleaned every day. I had plenty of towels and shampoo, etc., and only used them when I was out and the room needed cleaning. As always, you should leave a tip for each day of housekeeping. If you leave a large tip at the end, it might go to the person who cleaned your room once, while the person who had been doing it all week received nothing. I was happy to see that they took care with my things, and as I requested, left the AC alone. One note for people who like a cool room. In Vegas when the weather turns cooler, the AC doesn't work the same. (They call this cold but where I come from it is May, LOL!) In any case, on my 2nd night I finally got someone to fix it, and was told something interesting. The AC resets itself every 24 hours. So while I was getting a cool room at last, I had to remember to turn it off and then back on to the lowest setting available. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Of course there are things I would change, such as the smoking. Luckily we can request Non-smoking tables in the casino and we had people waiting to get to ours. I don't think management gives enough thought to the fact that most people do NOT smoke. I'm not hating on smokers here- just pointing out that gamblers who are bothered by smoke will often leave long before they mean to. As an asthmatic with allergies, I can only take so much. I met a woman and a group on my last night who were all happy to have the only NS table in single deck. But there are places that have NS pits, and THAT is the way to go until we are finally allowed clean air. I am not against smoker's rights. Smoke in your room, smoke in your home, but please at least ASK if it is okay to light up in front of me. I will very kindly cash in my chips and give you the table. For some reason, casinos have become the last bastion of cigarette use. Smokers who normally wouldn't think of lighting up in front of a stranger are blowing smoke in my face and getting ashes all over. I had to wash my hair 2-3 times a day b/c it's the only way to gamble. Can't ONE casino go non-smoking? I would be at the tables forever if the smoke didn't drive me to the safety of my room. And that last night I found tons of people who agree. People who leave when the smoke is too thick. I have stayed at tables despite the smoke on many, many occasions, simply b/c I'm having fun and I like the people I'm with. Yet, I always pay for it later. And I did leave MB that night and go to MGM where I was able to play in a NS pit. I won't EVER be rude about it. But that night MB lost my business b/c even at a NS table, we were bombarded by smoke from all directions, and then they send around \"Cigarette girls\" to make SURE we can't breathe. I have to compliment one pit boss, I think named CC? She made sure I had NS tables 2 nights in a row! And she helped the other people, too. Our dealers were happy to come to our table b/c they don't like it either. In fact, I would've been back down playing on my last night at 4am when I couldn't sleep, but I didn't want to have to wash my hair yet again. 3 times that day was enough. Someday, we'll be heard and a separate pit will be open here, too. MB is a great place, so it's GOT to occur to them that they're losing customers. But that's my only gripe. I had a great stay and look forward to returning. I loved my room loved the room service and spa, and Danny and CC were extra special employees. I usually compliment Mandalay on their other hotel, called simply \"The Hotel\". It's a great hotel and worth your time and money. But I haven't congratulated MB on their original hotel, and it's time. :) Good job, guys. Thanks for the comps and freeplay! I'll continue to take advantage of these offers. It's a blessing and I thank you."

    "content": "I stayed at Mandalay Bay Resort/Casino in Vegas in July 2011 for my wedding anniversary with my husband. It was a terrible experience, from start to finish; so bad it was almost comical. It started with the valet service. The line for valet was so long, it took 10-15 minutes just to get to the breezeway at the entrance to the hotel, so my husband went in to stand in line to get our room. I was in a dress, and NOT ONE of the valets offered to help me get the luggage out of our car. An elderly man in the car behind us offered, but I refused. When I got inside, my husband was still in line to get the room because there was NO organized system for thelines; it was every man for himself. When my husband was in one line, as soon as the person was finished helping the people in front of him, she abruptly turned the sign above her line to \"closed\" and just walked away. Then, once we finally got our room, although I had told them that it was our anniversary, and I had booked the room several months in advance, we were assigned to a room that looked directly out onto the roof, and the air conditioning units. It was early in the day, so I know there were plenty of rooms available at the time! They assigned us to another room when we called the front desk to complain, thinking things would get better. We were assigned to a room with a better view, but when we wanted to use the \"water complex\", we found that there was not a place to be found anywhere in the \"complex\" where we could find 2 lounge chairs together. We could have paid extra fees to use other areas of the complex, but that didn't make sense to me. The fees started at $25 just to sit at the pool at the resort I was already paying to stay at. In the room that we had been reassigned to, there was a box of hotel-provided soap on the bathtub that had someone's lipstick on it, like it had been used and just put back (so gross!). Any time we had to walk through the hallways, there were carts with trays of other guests' food remnants from room service; but it was clear that they would not be cleaned up until the next day. Gross! We also tried to charge one of our meals to our room at one of the hotel's restaurants called \"Raffles.\" We were told by the server that we didn't have a credit card on file (when of course we had been obligated to give them one upon check-in). We were forced to use our cash and straighten this out the next day. There were other things that occurred during our stay the first time, but I'll move on to the compensatory second stay, which I had hoped would go better. I wrote a letter to the Guest Relations Administrator at Mandalay Bay, Janis C. Fields, who offered us a complimentary stay at the hotel to prove that what we had experienced there was \"not indicative of the manner in which we intend to operate our resort.\" So, we decided to give it a second chance. This time, it was February, on a Thursday (off-season, off-day), I was really thinking things would be different this time. Well, the room was not ready, so Maria (the registration agent) told us that she would call us on my husband's cell phone when it was. Two hours go by, and we go back to check on the room, only to find out that yes, of course it's ready, just no one bothered to call us. Then, we were told to just call the Bell Desk once we were up in the room and they would bring us our bags. So, my husband tried to call them, but when he pressed the button for \"Bell Desk\" on the phone, it actually rang thru to Housekeeping, who got frustrated after he called twice and just hung up on him. Then, our room's coffee maker didn't. When I told the registration agent, Michael, about our concerns, he told me that \"our rooms don't have coffee makers in them.\" REALLY????? I would NEVER stay at Mandalay Bay ever again. I tell everyone I know about my experiences there, since I don't want them to have the same kind. I love Vegas; my husband and I go there about once every 6 months, and we try to stay at different places. We like to see what the different hotels have to offer. At Madalay Bay, it's smoke-filled hallways with stained carpet, potentially used toiletries in your room, laughable \"customer service,\" and a sense that no one in the corporate offices even cares, as long as they can collect your money."

The bathroom was one of the nicest I've experienced with a large tub, a separate shower, a tv and a separate little room for the toilet. There was a fridge in the room which was fully stocked and there were reminders that if you so much as touched something in there you would be charged for it. That and the prices of the almonds etc seemed ridiculous to me. I needed the fridge to store some leftovers from the great Italian restaurant downstairs and I did manage to fit them into the fridge without being charged, but be careful; those items are expensive! Another downside to the room was the glass panel/ window between the bathroom and the entryway into the room. If one wants privacy in the bathroom this is not a suitable partition. The pool area is great though at times some of the pools are not open. It gets a little crowded but it's fun and the alternative music they were playing over the speakers worked for me. The buffet was very good. I would stay here again but I wouldn't pay exorbitant prices. It's worth stretching the wallet a bit but I wouldn't overspend on it."

    "content": "Mandalay Bay is one of my favorites in Vegas. In town for a sales event, I (along with several thousand of my fellow workers) checked in over a two period. Check-in was handled quickly and efficiently, as was check-out. Unlike most (all?) other Vegas resorts, there is no need to traipse all the way through the casino to get to the elevator. My room was clean, larger than most Vegas standard rooms. The bathroom had both a jacuzzi tub and shower, a separate water closet, with tile and granite throughout. In a non-smoking room on the 8th floor, we did notice any smoke smells or loud noise. Our view overlooked the pools - not bad if you don't get a strip view - which were mostly deserted except for the workers in currently empty wave pool. Both wired and wireless internet were available - I think there is generally a charge but it was included in the corporate/convention rate for us. Minni-bar was typical over-priced (if higher quality than many) and I passed. Lke many of the higher end Vegas resorts, food options cover the range from very affordable (Raffles Cafe, Red White & Blue, and the buffet), to moderate (Fleur, Border Grill, Hussongs's, Burger Bar) to high end (Strip Steak, MIX, and former michelin star winner Aureole) and represent a broad selection of cuisines. This trip for me included dinner at Aureole and MIX. Both were excellent - the view from MIX (64th floor of THE Hotel) is just fabulous - with the Venison and MIX as my favorite meal of the week. Lunches included Fleur, Raffles, and Hussong's (a new addition in the Shops). All were very good. A return trip to Fleur for an evening snack was the winner here - the croque monsiour really brings back memories of Paris boulangeries. The convention center is typical of any large convention space, and buffet breakfasts served here were good. The \"convenience\" store next to the elevator bank on the first floor had your typical sundries - sodas, snacks, OTC remedies, knick-knacks and clothing sourvenir items - plus a wine/liquor section with an OK selection. The Shops at Mandalay Bay is a eclectic collection of bars, casual restaurants, clothing stores. The Peter Lik gallery is worth a walk-through, my wife's favorite was the \"Sock Exchange\". A range of affordable to higher end shops, though nothing approaching the Wynn/Bellagio style (Jimmy Choo, Coach, etc) - that's a good thing IMHO. It's location at the south end of the Las Vegas strip makes it very easy to get in/out of, is among the closest resorts to the airport, and has convenient access to I-15. It's a bit of a walk to the heart of the strip, but a free tram moves between here, Luxor, and Excalibur, which then puts you an easy walk to New York, New York and MGM. Overall, the experience was just as enjoyable as my first stay here 6 years ago. The rooms and casino area have been well maintained and are as nice as almost any resort in Vegas."

The main buffet did not meet the $30 price tag and most staff including servers in the buffet barely hit the average mark. The main hotel suffers from more glitz than quality and large size makes comfortable getting around difficult. The Venetian sets the gold standard for hotel rooms and quality. The Mandalay had another pitfall. The hotel room corridors had room service trays with food left astray for days. Several loud guests roamed the room corridors screaming, fighting and laying on the floor. The hotel elevators took forever and front desk would not answer phones for a long time. In general Las Vegas is not really a first class resort destination it once was. It is nothing more than a gambling town which has lost its flair."

I do have to say this place is great overall if you're looking to just enjoy the amenities there; but if you want to visit other areas of the strip, save some money for cab fare. The hotel is very tropical themed (seems like a place you could see built in Hawaii). Check in was very smooth and I was quickly able to get to my room. The room was not as new as the one I stayed in at MGM, but it was very nice and comfy. The bathroom though was great with a walk in shower and his and her sinks if you're traveling with someone. The layout of the casino is a little confusing and you can find yourself in circles if you don't learn how to navigate it, but once you learn it, it's not bad. I had a hard time finding the craps tables, but a dealer pointed it out to me once I asked them. The service was very friendly. The dealers are happy to explain the rules for each game as they may slightly vary by casino. I had a much better experience dining wise at Mandalay Bay than MGM. Their version of Studio Cafe, Raffles Cafe was a better bang for your buck in my opinion as the portions were more adequate for the price and the price was also reasonable. It was probably 1/3 cheaper than Studio and they didn't skimp. Only glaring problem I had is the location. It is the southern most hotel on the strip and away from a lot of the hotels. I wanted to see the Fountains of Bellagio and explore the center strip before I left so I did need to take a cab to Bellagio. If you want do to any exploring, save for cab fare because it would be a long walk to view the other sites. Overall I had a great time, and hope to be back when it's warmer so I can check out the pool."

I have previously stayed at the sister property \"The Hotel\" and highly recommend that hotel. In contrast, I am very disappointed by the condition of my current room and the lack of attention to details. While the hotel public areas are well appointed the hotel is reminiscent of a suburban mall and teems with people. My bed and bathroom seem clean but my room is simply somewhat shabby and lack essentials such as an in room coffee maker. The carpeting has areas of stains, the base of the dresser and the wood on the desk under the glass surface are both scuffed and worn. The phone on the desk is inoperable and has a constantly flickering message light. I attempted to turn on the behind the bed indirect lighting but was very annoyed by the constant flickering of the fluorescent bulbs and turned them off. I arrived at this hotel in early evening and had work to do, so I attempted to order room service but had no room service menu as my room is missing the hotel information binder. After I called room service and asked for a verbal listing of the menu, I ordered and received a tasty Cobb salad. However, I did not successfully order a glass of wine because they only carry chardonnay by the glass and I was looking for something else. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel or stay here again. There are lots of other options here in Las Vegas."

We rented a car this time and parking/proximity to the casino/hotel was better than others we parked at during the trip. Yes hotel is at southern most point of strip so if you are walking you can use the monorail service between Mlife properties or do like us an rent a cheap car for a few days to get around. Really liked the casino as well as it had high ceilings so it wasn't filled with smoke. Restaurants appeared to have good selection but we only ate at House Of Blues due to prior reservations elsewhere. Rooms were very clean and seemed almost brand new!"

You don't even need to leave the hotel! We had a huge room with a very comfortable bed, an immense bathroom with a hot tub and the best shower we've found on our trip.

A fully stocked mini bar, a large sofa, a large tv....who's complaining and why?"

We ate at the Bayside Buffet restaurant and that was pretty good. The seafood cioppino stew was delicious. We had a strip view, it was nice, but you are at the very end of all the action....so it is a long walk. The rooms were quiet and the beds comfortable. The downside of the visit was the bathroom. The shower drain was clogged and I was able to finish before it overflowed onto the floor. Same problem with the tub. Maintenance was called and he came very quickly and was able to unclog the drain. Nasty black goo was all over the shower floor afterwards and the maintenance man called for housekeeping to come. An hour and a half later, they knock on our door, but by that time we were sleeping and didn't want them to come in. It was an alright stay."

The beach is fun, wave pool is cool, lazy lagoon a fun change, and is a very relaxing place to spend the day. They have some mediocre food options by the pool, as well as a full bar. POOL TIP: If you want a cheaper margarita than the $14 ones offered at the pool bar then go get a giant margarita from one of the stores in the shopping mall between Mandalay and Luxor. They will let you bring these into the pool since they are purchased from a Mandalay owned store. ROOMS: Our room was awesome! My wife still talks about the amazing bahtroom that had it's own flat panel tv. She loved getting ready in that bathroom! It had a huge tub and separate huge glass enclosed shower too. The bed was huge and comfortable and we had a great view of the pool and strip! LOCATION: Do not stay here if location on the strip is important to you. There are trams that take you to Excalibur, but even then you're at the end of the main strip and have to walk quite a ways to other hotels. If you're looking to walk the strip often, then find a better location for your stay. We didn't care about it, so it wasn't a concern for us. DINING: The only options in the hotel were either super over-priced high-end restaurants or just slightly over-priced complete crap. We were not impressed with anything offered in the hotel. Overall, we will go back to Mandalay Bay in the future if the pool is open and we can get a sub $150 / night room rate. Hope you have a good trip!"

The Burger Bar was our favorite restaurant and Minus 5 was such a cool (literally ;)) bar!! I liked the fact it was in a mall setting--it gave lots of options of activities to do and things to see. We also ate at Border Grill, but didn't like it at all. it is far away from the strip--and if you're anything like me, you didn't really think it was until the walk back :) The shuttle helps a lot!! if you're going to an event (were were going to Tempo--the new years party) don't be surprised if it's like pulling teeth trying to get the tickets you've already purchased. It was like they had so much going on but nobody knew where tickets and info was for each event. It would have been nice if each staff member could answer basic questions..it was like they always had to \"ask someone else\" or \"call someone for help.\" Tempo--the new years party was a BLAST!!!!! We had such a great time!! It was very fancy, and totally worth the money! It was a great way to ring in 2012. Make sure you CHECK YOUR BANK STATEMENT after staying here!! They charged us WAY more than they were supposed to. It took awhile to finally get a hold of someone (again, a problem with customer service!!) but once we finally were able to talk to someone they fixed it, no problem. They also comped our drinks that we had drank in our room from the mini fridge---simple but nice touch! We would probably not stay here again, just because it's so far away from the strip. However, we'd definitely go back for the Burger Bar!!"

Room quality and carpets were mediocre. We toured Hoover dam and valley of fire , I would recommend those two places for kids, we had a nice time visiting these places.

The price was a lot higher this year because CES was in town at the same time -- supply and demand, I get that. But we spent over $300/night and were very disappointed. The main reason is that the room was dirty. The first night my husband was at a meeting and I decided to work out in the room. I noticed lint, etc. on the carpet and upon closer examination noticed a piece of broken glass! Thank goodness I saw it before getting up barefoot in the middle of the night. I called housekeeping who said they would come and vacuum. There was also dust on most surfaces and the top of the bathroom mirror was so dirty it looked fogged over. Well, even after housekeeping came it wasn't any better! The person I spoke to (I asked for a manager) wasn't very apologetic either -- broken glass is a big deal to me! I saw the maid vacuum and there was still a plastic tag (from a price tag on clothing I guess) on the carpet after she left, as well as pieces of fuzz and lint. Bad vacuum or not emptying the bag? The top of the mirror didn't get clean in three days -- I guess she couldn't reach it. The furniture was scuffed and there was a big stain on the carpet too. The beds were poorly made -- the sheets not even tucked in. I also complained about the temperature and was told someone would come and look at it, which never happened. The heat has a top limit I guess and no matter what you set it at it never goes above 72. We sure don't keep our heat at 72 at home, but we were chilly the whole time, so I'm guessing the thermostat was broken. But as I said, they never came to look at it as promised. The size of the room is huge and the bathroom is wonderful (loved the shower!), but dirty rooms are just gross. We also were put in a smoking room, which we didn't realize until we had unpacked and returned from dinner. We knew the hotel was sold out so I didn't even bother to ask about moving. It isn't a huge issue for us, but we also were unfortunately in a connecting room. No problem the first night, but the second and third nights the smoke was really coming in under the door in between the rooms. After putting towels down to block the opening it got tolerable, but I did notice all my clothes smelled when we got home. I know some of that is just Vegas. The crowning disappointment was after coming home I found out my credit card had been cloned and used in another state (not our home state or Nevada). The only place I used it was in the Border Grill -- so I can only assume the server there cloned it when we paid our lunch bill. We won't stay here again."

We also ate at Bacio's which is inside the Tropicana. Wonderful Italian meal. Be sure and check out the TIX4Tonight stands. We bought tickets to 2 shows for much cheaper and also meal vouchers that give you a percentage off. 1 was up to 50% off, plus they make the reservations for you. Be sure and use the monorail system they have. A lot less walking. Mandalay is close to the airport so no need to rent a car. We had no noise from the airport in our room either.

We have stayed here before (both at MB and at Thehotel on the MB property), and we would stay here again. Rooms are clean, spacious, and quiet; staff is attentive and helpful; gaming is enjoyable; and waitress/drink services are fairly prompt while playing. We have stayed at all the MGM/Mirage properties, and have found that we prefer the Mandalay Bay and Thehotel over all the rest because of the combination of size, comfort and overall amenities offered. Located on the South End of the Strip, some complain of the location, but I like it. There is a tram that connects Mandalay Bay with Luxor and Excalibur. From there, you can either go over Tropicana Boulevard to get to the MGM Grand (and the Las Vegas Monorail), or continue walking north to Monte Carlo and take another tram to Aria and Bellagio. There is no trouble getting to the North Strip from Mandalay Bay if you are prepared to do just a little bit of walking (which is good for you anyway). There is a also a nice walking mall (\"Mandalay Place\") that connects the hotel with Luxor, and also an interior walkway that takes you further on to Excalibur. During the winter months, \"The Beach at Mandalay Bay\" pools are largely closed with the exception of \"Moorea.\" This is the \"adult-only, clothing-optional\" pool during the Spring/Summer/Fall months, but it serves as the \"family friendly\" [and only available] pool during the Winter months. Vegas temps during the day in early/mid February are in the high 50s/low 60s, with lows at night reaching into the low 40s. Chilly at night, but still quite comfortable during the day. All in all, a very enjoyable stay! Come to Mandalay Bay and see for yourself!"

She wouldn't listen to me and rushed me off the phone; after I had already waited 10 mins in my room to even get someone to pick-up to talk to. I tried calling back multiple times to see if I would get someone else but the wait was ridiculous! I was really disappointed with her level of \"customer service\" and wished I had received friendly help; afterall, my family and I paid a pretty penny to stay there!! My family and I were wandering around in the Venetian hotel and I visited their Concierge desk and boy were they so warm and helpful! I even got discounted tickets to Phantom of the Opera from them!

The convention center is huge and was well-supported the whole week. All staff encountered whether front desk, concierge, restaurant, convention, business center, or housekeeping were professional and generally friendly. The basic guest room is large and luxurious with his & hers closets and a laptop-size safe. The bathroom has a deep tub and a glass-enclosed shower with a separate water closet. Cleanliness was okay, but could have been better (hair on shower glass, inconsistent vacuuming). I almost rated the Mandalay Bay \"Excellent\", but not being a gaming fan, by the end of the week I was being affected from second hand smoke since you have to go through the casino to get to the convention center or restaurants. Appreciated the indoor connection to the neighboring Luxor and Excalibur."

It was so beautiful and modern I couldn't believe my eyes. Then I saw the rest of the room. Beautiful. Flawless. The view was super too: my room faced the big wave pool. What is interesting about Mandalay Bay is that they achieve elegance without making you feel like you need to be better dressed. Some ritzy hotels are intimidating. Not Mandalay Bay. It is like the kind of hotel that makes you feel at home. I appreciated the huge desk in my room. I was able to work on my laptop and write. I liked the wave pool, even though the waves are not very forceful. The food is always excellent. I never had to wait for anything at the hotel. The front desk was very efficient, and the restaurants top notch. I liked how friendly the restaurant staff was. Sometimes staff at expensive hotels seem afraid of their own shadow, overly concerned that they will somehow insult a guest. But not at Mandalay Bay. They felt comfortable enough to joke around with me. What a nice change of pace."

The hotel is very clean, always someone cleaning the floors, wiping down the slot machines, but it does show its age through the carpets in the hallways to your room and the rooms in general. The duvets are nice not too warm not too cool, the beds were comfortable. Shower pressure just average but right in your face as far as where the height of the showerhead was. Rooms were not the quietest could here the traffic in the hallway. But the spa was super. Picked the nirvana treatment with a 25 min massage added on and had Gracia for the whole treatment. The girl has magic in her fingertips. Massage, scalp massage, and wrap were out of this world just as she promised going in. The buffet was good as well, the salt and pepper shrimp along with the fresh shrimp were excellent. This hotel is very convenient to get in and out with the rental car from avis. They, the avis people, were very accomodating and saved us from packing our luggage and golf clubs from the airport to the car rental and into a car and then to the hotel. Just go to the hotel, drop bags with the bellhop, check in, go to avis rent your car, put your clubs in the car, have your bags delivered to your room. Simple as pie. They could loosen up the slot games just a touch. Would be nice to win a little wouldn't it? May go back just to try the lazy river ride in the summer and to see Gracia again."

The shower had no water pressure and only let out scolding hot water. The worst part were the beds...the pillows had feathers coming out of them. I woke up with scratches every morning.

The sound system in this Hotel is the worlds worst or the team running it should be fired. I don't mind loud music but I would like to hear who I went to see. The volume and BASS COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY MORE HIGHER. The singers couldn't be heard over the BASS. The music (noise) was louder than the singers. My shirt and pants vibrated on my skin and my ears actually hurt. The people that work in and around the treater have to where ear protection. I know because I couldn't stay in the theater. I was taking to security and concession people and they all said the noise level make them use ear protection. Even when Brad was just talking his voice was megga Bass. I don't get it. Now lets talk about Floor Seating. Don't expect to see the show if you want to sit in your seat. For three hours eveyone on the floor stands and never sits down. Never pay for Floor Seating in a Big Arena if you don't want to stand to view the show. Blake Shelton is coming there soon but I won't go. NEVER AGAIN WITH A SOUND SYSTEM LIKE MANDALAY BAY HAS. I have been to see Brad Paisley at other places and the sound can be heard clearly and loud without ear pain. It wasn't just me but everyone sitting around me couldn't stand it either"

At night time, there is a monorail to take you to Excaliber Hotel next door so you can get to the strip, as Mandalay Bay is at the very end of it.. Thats all very well, except the monorail stops at 10.30pm, no use if you are out and about til late (as we were), so a lot of walking to be done or catch taxis. The hotel itself is fine, rooms are nice. Its a very large hotel so not easy to just race up to your room. The casino seemed a little bare of people, the bars are good, restaurants are good. The carpark was a disaster, as we had been out in the day, and came back at 6pm to find there were no car spaces left. The car park is huge, and when we finally found one, we had a long way to walk to the hotel entry point carrying bags. We have stayed in other hotels in Las Vegas before, and I don't think I would stay at Mandalay again, mainly because of its location....a little isolated. The room was VERY expensive, and they charge a resort fee as well...but we weren't able to use the resort, which really was the beach and pools."

    "content": "Instead of holding a room under a credit card like most every other hotel in the world, a current MGM property money maker is to make you pay for the first night of your reservation in advance. I booked four rooms for friends, with the assurance from reservations that once another credit card was put toward the room upon check in, my card would be credited back. I found out that, if they actually do credit it back, it generally takes 7-10 days for the money to be put back in the account, not to mention however many days in advance you make your reservation before you actually check in. I'm sure MGM collects interest on a person's deposit all that time. It isn't a lot per person, but 50,000 rooms (or whatever) over the course of a year, is probably significant. Fourteen days later, I had to call MGM's accounting to be credited back. I spent 30 minutes on the phone and the problem was finally fixed. However, that's 30 minutes during business hours that I won't get back. I wonder how many people don't pay attention and end up paying double for their rooms. Nice scam. I won't be going back to an MGM property. They should have been thrilled to get the money I lost on the tables, in their restaurants, gift shops, and on their $20/day \"resort fee.\" I'm sure the shareholders like it, but as a guest, it just created a big headache for me. It's too bad, because Mandalay itself was a nice place to stay."

The front desk was completely unprepared to receive its guests; they kept all the guests standing in line for more than 20 minutes at the midnight hour just to be served. When I finally reached the front desk, I was told that the type of room I reserved with the hotel directly months in advance was not available. Then, the front desk representative took time getting \u201capproval\u201d for a room upgrade from a manager in the office behind the counter. This behavior was very inconsiderate, given that I had a long day traveling and the time was close to 1 A.M. On the second day, I double checked with the front desk concerning the number of complimentary breakfasts I would to receive during my stay. The front desk told me, more than once, that I would to receive complimentary breakfast everyday that I stayed there, despite the original package stipulated that breakfast for two was only available for one of the two days I stayed. We trusted the front desk\u2019s words, which turned out to be wrong. The charge for the breakfast on the 2nd day showed up on my hotel bill, and I had to call the front desk asking them to reverse the charge. I was looking forward to working out everyday. Alas, the fitness facility looks a lot smaller than what is shown on the hotel\u2019s website, and cardio center was only opened until 8 P.M. When I was working out in the early evening on my last day at the hotel, someone showed up to maintain the treadmills. He was making loud noises with his vacuum, taking apart the equipment and was extremely disruptive. There were several guests exercising when this happened. I am not sure why this maintenance personnel could not come back a couple hours later to maintain the treadmills, given it was only 2-3 hours prior to closing. There was a hotel staff manning the cardio room; she did not ask the maintenance person to postpone his maintenance work until closing. Again, this behavior was very inconsiderate, given that the hotel charged every guest $20 resort fee everyday! The housekeeping staff was excellent, though I found a cigarette butt in my non-smoking room ."

The fees are about $22 a day, which includes pool (which was too cold to go to), internet, and the exercise room. My bill would up being just under $90 from the resort fees, for 4 nights. Room was clean, with 2 queen beds. Bathroom was a nice size. My only complaint was that the internet acess was a bit slow, both from the wireless and wired. So we used the internet sparingly. If you can, get a free pass to the Foundation Room, on the top of Mandalay bay. It's a bar/nightclub on the very top ot the hotel, with a stunning 500-foot view of the Strip! You can get a free pass from any one of the casino employees."

The room was absolutely massive and the nicest of our whole trip. The bed was very big and there was a sitting area with an unusual sofa. The highlight was the bathroom with the spa bath and television. Access to the casino floor was easy, and the check in staff were very efficient. The only thing I would say is that this hotel isn't the best location, as it's right at the southern end of the strip.

The rooms are nice, very spacious. The bathrooms are huge! The down-side to staying here was that the cleanliness level in both some of the common areas and the rooms could be improved on. It was just small stuff, like a splatter on the wall or a rip in the carpet. The other detracting factor is that it IS on the very far end of the strip which can be a pain. In general though, for what we paid - I'd recommend it. If I were going to pay more, I'd stay closer to the heart of the Strip."

It was December and cold but there was one pool open up in the beach club that was heated and they had an outdoor bar open as well, despite the outdoor temperature.

    "content": "Stayed at Mandalay Bay Hotel in late January. While the hotel was adequate it did nothing to set itself apart from other hotels in the area and would actually fall short of its four star rating overall. Service in the restaraunts was average at best and often times less. There are definite oppurtunities for improvement at Mandalay. Some touch up painting in the hallways and rooms and on the room doors was one thing that quickly stood out but would obviously not impact your stay directly in a negative manner. Rooms and room amenities were acceptable but could be better. Example, how about some shower gel? I didn't even know they still made bar soap! Beds are very VERY comfortable! Wanted to take it home with me. Upon reading reviews prior to our visit many guests said the hotel layout was not ideal which caused excess walking to and from your room and also that there were constant lines to use the elevators which caused a lot of waiting. This couldn't be farther from the truth. The hotel layout is actually superb and better than most in the area. All wings of the hotel are hubbed in the center where the bank of elevators are located with the casino and restaraunts below. Layout is perfect and we never had to wait on an elevator more than 30 seconds. Pretty remarkable considering how many floors make up the hotel. I think maybe some of these guests just weren't used to staying in a hotel/resort of this magnitude which is typical of most hotels on the strip. The casino was open and spacious and with its high ceilings was not as smokey as some of the other smaller casinos. Casino vibe was laid back and relaxed. Raffles cafe was a great spot for breakfast but again service was not impressive anywhere in the hotel or restaraunts. Pool area was closed but would certainly be a huge attraction during warmer months as it is the nicest in the area. Encountered a couple of friendly hotel staff members but most were invisible or simply doing there jobs, nothing over the top or anything done to make you feel welcomed or valued as a guest. My biggest downside to staying at this property and it is no fault of the hotel, its managment or its facilites is the location. I know that it is Vegas and walking is inevitable, but it is so far from the main area of the strip that the walking combined with the mediocrity of the hotel and its service just doesn't warrant staying here. Even with the free tram from Mandalay to Excalibur and the monorail access across the street at MGM you still have to walk an unbelieveable distance to and from anywhere on the strip. Mandalay is the last hotel on the south end of the strip. If I had to make a recommendation i would reccomend staying at the Venetian or Caesars Palace which are more centrally located and are overall nicer hotels, however they will come with a slightly higher price tag. If you are looking for something a little more economical or modest I would not hesitate to stay at Harrahs or the Mirage. Though i would likely not return, It was a pleasant stay with no regrets at Mandalay."

    "content": "Even though we go to Las Vegas regularly we hadn't stayed at Mandalay Bay for about 7 years. The last time we stayed there we felt like we didn't fit in with the demographics; we felt older and out of sync with the \"vibe\". But I was invited to play in a slot tournament and we thought we'd give it another try. We're glad we did. We felt much more comfortable being there this time. We're a mid-50's very active couple but we didn't feel like posers with a bunch of late 20 year olds like last time. We fit in. But that's not to say that the place was skewing old we just felt it was much more all encompassing for various age groups. I saw plenty of younger attractive people but there were folks our age too--and JUST as attractive in our own way, I might add!! :) I think the rooms might have been redone. I politely asked if there were any upgrades available and the desk clerk checked and said there was. We were put in a nice suite overlooking the strip I tipped her for her efforts and she appreciated the gesture but I don't think that's the reason I got it. But if you're upgraded I hope you show your appreciation. One downside, and I remember this from before, is that we could hear the folks in the room next to us when they came in (alot later than us). I wish Las Vegas hotels would put signs in the hallways (like Greenbrier does) that asks people to be quiet when walking down the halls at night (\"Sleepy time down south\"). The signs would probably be ripped apart or laughed at or something but I personally think a lot of people would be respectful--they just forget. Oh well it IS Vegas. But still...so that was the only downside of the room and it wasn't unbearable by any means. The common areas and casino are as nice as if the place had just opened. We had great meals at Border Grill and Aureole too. If you dine at Aureole--and it's expensive frankly--ask for Alfredo. He was our waiter and has been with the restaurant since it opened about 12 years ago. We like that about LV; the fact that many of the serving staff are professionals and not in stepping stone jobs. The other dining comment is that for breakfast we like to conserve our calories and just have coffee and maybe a danish or something. There is a bar that sells coffee right next to the elevators. If you walk a ways you'll find a Starbucks too. But before you get to Starbucks there's a place called Red White and Blue and they offer coffee and pastries. My wife thought their lattes were superior to Starbucks, by the way. The only other downside to MB might be its location. But cabs are reasonable and taking the side streets and/or freeway the trip up to Bellagio/Mirage was quick and cheap. It didn't hurt frankly that I won some money but I lost more than I won so it's not like I'm on a winning streak high as I write this about MB. :) We're glad we went and we'll definitely be back."

However, we found the convenience of having the monorail connection between the Luxor and Excalibur to be sufficient, but there is definitely lots of walking to get to them. The rooms were luxurious and the beds very comfortable. We had a panoramic view looking out towards the airport from our room. Our relatives had rooms overlooking the pool area, although not as great a view. Bathrooms were well appointed. The buffet at this resort, for me, was the best I had been to on the strip with lots of good quality choices. But the best part of the stay was the pool area. We really enjoyed spending time there and we had a choice of different pools. Their teenage daughter and her friend loved it too. I would definitely stay there again."

We arrived at the hotel on Thursday morning at approximately 10 AM. The lines for checking in were backed up with people checking out. It took us a good hour to get checked in to get our bags moved to storage and were told our rooms would be ready in a couple of hours. Throughout the weekend we visited other hotels, restaurants, and casinos. We found the Mandalay Bay resort to be a little outdated compared to some of the other hotels in Vegas. It was also a very large property that one could very easily get lost in. Overall, the staff in the breakfast restaurant was average. We were pleased that there was a Starbucks in the resort and frequented the Starbucks every morning. I do not want to sound like a prima-donna, but unfortunately our bucket list trip at the Mandalay Bay resort was just average. The other hotels in Vegas seemed to have gone to great lengths to refurbish update and modernize their hotel. The Mandalay Bay has not done this.

I definitely recommend the Hotel over the regular resort. It wasn't bad, in fact it was decent, but not great. The room was adequate, large and nicely decorated. The giant picture windows with a view of the airport was actually pretty cool. But, the bed was terribly lumpy. The pillows, mere pillowettes. The bedding seemed cheap. We didn't get housekeeping service for two of the four days, and I have no idea why. We were in the room and housekeeping came by for \"room check\" at about 10 a.m. But she didn't have a cart, I have no idea what room check is. Then, no one returned to freshen up the room. It irritated me because there weren't enough towels and I want someone else to make my bed when I am on vacation. The lobby, casino and all the bars & shops are convenient, clean and adequate. The location is great to me because it is close to the airport and has a monorail stop. We rented a cabana at the pool, which was reasonably priced and lots of fun to meet up with our friends. It's January, so not really \"pool weather.\" However, the Cabana was a great way to congregate in a somewhat private way without having to go to a restaurant or lobby of a hotel. We watched football and ordered lots of drinks and food. The service was kinda spotty, we always had to hunt down someone to get us drinks and foods. However, the staff came out in force at 4:45 to clear everyone out. I had no idea they had so many people working! Also, I arrived a day after my husband and I had to go to the front desk to get my key while my husband was out playing golf. I arrived at a really busy time, about 2:00 p.m. on Saturday. The line was super long and Not Moving. In fact, I waited so long in line that my husband arrived before I ever made it close to the front desk. It seemed staffed up, but I didn't observe long enough to figure out if there was some problem at the front desk or just a busy time that requires you to stand a long time. Our room was pretty quiet, I couldn't hear the room next to me, but in the middle of the night there were lots of hallway sounds."

It wouldn't be a big probelm if the lift rides were short, but they're not. The building doesn't seem to have enough lifts for the volume of guests, hence your lift stops on many floors before you finally get to the foyer or up to your room.

It is merely a request. What do they do for you if they don't hold your reservation? One would think they would offer some type of complimentary something to you. NO they don't. They merely say a \"reservation\" is a request and we don't have the room you \"reserved.\" They then offer to send up some type of machine to clean the room. We had to request that machine be sent 3x before anything happened. The machine did nothing. You still have a room that has been smoked in; you can smell the smoke; the room has cigarette burns in the couches, etc. Worst Las Vegas trip I ever had. Thanks Mandalay Bay.

Our room was very nice and quiet (either that or I just slept well and wouldn't have heard a nuclear bomb going off). Housekeepers were very friendly and helpful and did a great job attending to our room. Friendly experience at check in and also gave nice warning about in-room bar and snack tray to make sure we didn't get charged for what we didn't want. A slightly sketchy experience at the information desk with lady who seemed to not enjoy her job, otherwise, every other experience with staff was great. Nice choice of restaurants with variety of price choices. House of Blues was nice to have right there in the hotel. Shuttle between Mandalay and Excalibur was very convenient. Found fellow guests less obnoxious than at other hotels, perhaps because of Mandalay's \"out of the way\" reputation. Will definitely go there again if we visit Vegas."

I always win there, and I go every year. The only complaint I have about this hotel is that it's far away from the strip. Nevertheless, there is a lot to do in this hotel. I would stay there again.

Every time a neighboring guest came back to a nearby room (always at 4-5 a.m., of course), the giant plastic mirror on the wall shook and woke us up. There is no coffee pot in the room. There is a fridge, but you can't use it because its stocked with a pressurized mini-bar (which, if you move anything, you get charged for it). The bed wasn't very comfortable. And, there is a giant light outside your window, so you have to spend some time getting the shades lined up perfectly so that its not peeping in. The shower was obviously designed by a man, as there is no way for a woman to shave her legs in that shower. Also no room for shampoo, etc. in the shower. We reserved a King room, and they gave us a room with 2 queens - with no apology, chance for upgrade, etc. Also, they charge a $20 per day \"resort fee\" for things you probably won't use while you're there anyway. However, Treasure Island did this to us as well, so maybe all Vegas hotels are doing it now. I would probably not stay here again."

I thought after Christmas but before New Year would be a good time to visit, I was wrong. Valet was a mess, an hour and twenty minutes wait; check in wasn't all that great either. The elevators were working overtime, long waits and packed in like sardines. Get to the room and what a view, 24th fl. looking down the strip, breathtaking! The room was big as was the bathroom/tub! The bed was comfortable and housekeeping was great bringing more pillows. A fee for the internet applies and the main airport across the street was too noisy. Onto dinner - again, the elevators took so long we walked down 24 flights of stairs (a few time during our stay...) We walked around looking for a great place to eat but found the lines like the best rides at Disney, long, winding with no end in sight. Even getting coffee in the morning was a wait. We did try: the Mexican food restaurant, House of Blues, some dinner and the Asian restaurant, all were pretty good. At night you never realize how far from the center of everything you really are until you need to get back to Mandalay Bay. There are trams but stop running around 10:30 pm. and taxis are costly so make sure you have a comfortable pair of walking shoes. It's a nice long walk but good for you! The next day it was off to the lazy river and beach, after all, it is Mandalay \"Bay,\" and I wanted to just sit back forget about the 7 hour driver to Vegas (one accident can mess the whole 4 hour drive), the long waits for valet, elevators and restaurants and there it was in all it glory, a sign stating the pools/beaches were closed! What, did I miss something??? This is Mandalay BAY, not Mandalay Casino! I needed answers because there was never any mention of the main attraction being close so off to the concierge and you guessed it, this guy was a real... No help, telling me it clearly states the area is closed on the website, of course I rechecked for myself and there is NO MENTION of this. I called and spoke to a very polite manager who was truly sorry and offered 50 bucks at almost any restaurant. That was a nice gesture for the fact I had to deal with a staffs bad attitude. I could go on for two pages about this, lets just say it not good! On the bright side again the management ways generous and threw me a few small bones so I got to kick back in the sauna area on their dime and a small meal voucher. Now to be honest, I had very high expectations and drove away disappointed. Great room, mediocre staff and found myself going to hotels closer to the middle of the strip for good food and entertainment and service. I was sent a survey a few days after our stay and at the end it asked if I'd like to be contacted I said yes, gave some good times to call and the calls came in well before or well after my suggested times. Seriously, one hand does not know what the other is doing. I will say that if you have a high level of visibility with your membership card you do get a higher level of service and you are reminded of that at every turn because there are signs letting you know how small you really are! I really wish things would have been better because I was looking forward to bragging rights."

Took 2 phone calls and a trip to Reception to insist that we were allocated another room - not much fun after a 10 hour flight! On 28th floor with a full length window so if you suffer from vertigo, stay back! Our view was of the Freeway that runs parallel to the Strip and out to the desert; fas.cinating nonethless to watch the changing colours Spacious room and queen size bed with large immaculate bathroom and jaccuzi. Located at far end of Strip which was fine for us as we we didn't want the hussle and bussle and were happy to walk or take the frequent Deuce bus service that travels the length of the Strip with regular stops along the way. 24 hr or 3 day pass is a bargain. Cost of room much more expensive at weekends when casino demand is at its highest but price dropped by more than 50% from Monday to Thursday. In house restaurants quite pricey. Used Raffles for huge breakfasts. Service here was excellent. Red White and Blue Burger Bar served huge burgers at reasonable price.fraction of the Mnadalay and we were there 3 nights. Be prepared to walk miles - even in hotels. We saw only a fraction even though we were there for 3 nights. We are CSI fans where the Mandalay is featured in the opening panorama of LV; it really is a golden vision on the skyline. Quite an experience in LV although for us it was really only a means of getting to the Grand Canyon. Much preferred the natural beauty and real grass of G C and California!!"

But how can you guys expect to compete with other premium restort in LV without a bare sense of HOSPITALITY?!?!?! 1. Reservation made 3 months in advance for a NON-SMOKING room. We get to the hotel, we check in, the person at check in does not advice but when we get to the rooms the rooms are SMOKING rooms and the smell of the smoke is overwhelming. 2. we call the front desk and the person we first talk to does not even want to reply our question on a) is there anything you can do? b) WHY this happened?!?!?!. She hands us over to the manager... 3. Reno, manager front desk at that time of the day, says \"he understands\" but in fact he doesn't. My partner has bad sinus infection and she's allergic to tobacco, we tell him about our reservation being for non-smoking, we ask for a room change, he admits \"there are non-smoking rooms available\" but he says \"we're witing for people with reservation with check in. Well....we had that damn reservaion and you don't care anyway, so do you have various types of reservations? like \"A class\" and \"b class\"? as solution, he send a bellman 10 minutes later with 3 other rooms options, all SMOKING room. Are you dumb or what?!?!? but then... 4) he says that reservations are managed on a first come first serve basis. Well, if that's the case and you still have non-smoking rooms available and you're still waiting for people to check-in, shouldn't that principle apply??? I came first, before other people, with a clear and explicit ask for a non-smoking room. Poor management or poor communication, it doesn't matter: I won't come here again and I also ask my company (yes, it was a travel booked my a corporate travel agency) to ban you guys from the list of conventioned hotels. Do you think I care about your room size, the plasma in the rooms, the large shower, when your hospitality is SO POOR?!?!?!?!"

Noise from adjoining rooms wasn't an issue for us, and I'm usually very critical when it comes to this. That said, it should be noted that we were towards the very end of the hall. If you're sensitive to noise from your neighbors, you might be well served to request a similar room. There are several choices for dining, but most were quite expensive. Even the \"reasonable\" restaurants found us digging deep into our wallets. Without question, the best deal to be had when it comes to meals is to purchase an all-day pass at the buffet. Also, had a great extended happy hour at the House of Blues... was good to escape the gambling for a while and enjoy some reasonably priced drinks. Cocktail service on the casino floor was very hit-and-miss. Some of the waitresses were very attentive, but most of the time there wasn't one to be found. Strange, because there seemed to be at least three working the poker room, even if there were only two tables occupied. In all, the staff was very friendly. Despite how it might look on a map, you shouldn't really consider this a \"strip\" hotel. Located at the very south end of the strip, it takes a good half hour to get to the MGM, which is where the monorail ends. So if you're looking to explore the strip and hop from hotel to hotel without needing to take a cab or wasting an inordinate amount of your vacation time walking, keep this in mind."

After having to call 5 times and email a scanned image of their offer we finally received a booking. Shortening story here to most important part of our stay. New Years Eve we enjoy a fantastic night out and return around 2am. My friends went into their rooms and we were stuck with two non working keys. Called front desk from friends room and was told we were \"pinned\" out and needed a second credit card on file (for our supposedly free room). They had already charged our card on file close to a $1000 for tickets to Love ( which was supposed to be split between all the rooms anyways). Went to front desk and was again told nothing they can do. VIP services requested the lock out and f course no one was there at that time. I became irate and asked the \"supervisor\" if I should sleep in the hall. Her diplomatic response was to tell me she'd call security if I didn't change my tone! After I calmed down a bit I pulled out my phone, logged into my bank account and showed her the $988.70 in charges already posted by Mandalay Bay. At this point she said she'd let us back into our room. An apology would have been nice but that wasn't coming anytime soon. We hiked back to our room and find that no our keys don't work... Back to desk, new keys are issued by a new person. Back to room and there's a security guard waiting for us... He said he'd open the door and I told him no we are fine. My wife tried first with no luck. He offered again and I said no I didn't want him in our room at all. My key worked and my wife gave him hers. I have stayed at Mandalay Bay at least 5 times and can't count the number of people I've recommended it to. I will not be returning. Had anyone working there taken responsibility, offered a sincere apology or showed any empathy I wouldn't be so angry. I did receive an email survey as well yesterday and was more than happy to fill it out, including leaving my contact info. Well apparently, they don't much care as I haven't heard a thing from them."

I have stayed at the Mandalay Bay 5 times over the past 6 years or so and my visit at Xmas 2011 for 6 nights was our last visit. There appears to be a problem with the way that MGM are maintaining the previous high standard that the hotel used to have. Standards and quality have noticibly slipped and this has been confirmed by some members of staff we spoke to. I don't want to bore anyone with too much detail, so, in summary the bad points are: - The rooms we were offered were tired and smelt of stale cigarettes (despite the fact that they were non smoking rooms) - The rooms in question were a 600SS and 750GR. We tried to put up with the 750GR for 1 night and were kept awake by some very loud people in the adjoining room through the completely useless unsoundproofed party door. - The buffet has gone down hill in both food quality and food variety. It used to be spectacular and on special days it was more than spectacular. Now, it is only average and frankly disappointing. Some of the surly breakfast staff are providing a less than acceptable table service and seem to be only good for clearing tables. - The checkout process was diabolical with massive queues, especially in the casino/vip queue which we thought would have provided a better service. After 40 minutes we got to the front of the queue to find the bill was wrong and that the Mlife people had not updated the bill with the accumulated comps from our stay, we had visited the Mlife players club 3 hours before we checked out and agreed the reduced new bill and we were told it would be updated straight away. So at checkout, the woman doing out bill had to try and ring the mlife desk to find out what was going on, their phone was permanently engaged and it took another 30 minutes to get through and get the bill sorted, even then it was still wrong and she had to phone them again repeatedly to get someone to actually update the bill properly and for us to pay only what we had agreed to earlier with Mlife. The whole checkout system and the way it interfaces with the Mlife comp people just does not work at all and it is no wonder there are horrendous queues and angry customers. After checkout, we did politely but firmly complain to the guy managing the queues in the lobby (he said he was the only one we should complain to) and guess what he was apologetic but offered no explanation or any interest in actually wanting to correct get to the root cause of the problem and the shambolic process whereby the mlife people have to update the bill in a timely fashion prior to checkout. If you have no comp to worry about and you have no queries on your bill, then yes the express checkout on the tv or at the lobby is ok. In summary, we would suggest that if you are determined to stay at the Mandalay or have already booked then make sure you change to THEHotel as as the rooms were nicer, quieter and actually smelt clean. On the plus side the room discounts when booking through the Mlife system and the comps that accumulate during the stay do save money but the very painful process of checking out, the old smelly noisy bedrooms and the dismal buffet means that next time we will have to go somewhere else outside the group."

The hotel is at the bottom of the strip but it's a nice walk and a good way of working off those Vegas portions. Have fun."

You also get free phone calls through their antiquated poor sound quality telephone system. Wifi is free if you came to Vegas to spend time on the net. None of these \"servces\" cost the hotel anything but a few pennies.. I believe all the hotels in Vegas do this so they can tell you to go somewhere else if you don't want to pay for thiese add ons. Hotel rooms ok with good view of the other hotels if you pay extra to get the view. Elevators not adequate and no hotel staff to indicate which elevators are available, causing a lot of pushing and shoving to try to get on an elevator before it leaves Uniformed staff friendly and helpful. Lots of smiles and \"No English\" from much of the non uniformed staff.. Restaurants.Good. Prices ok. Very impersonal computerized system of paying in advance if you want the buffet. Long lines but they move reasonably well. Cab lines and waits long. I gave up smoking some years ago, but you can get all the nicotene and tobacco smoke stench you want from the casino and the people in the casino if you come within 20 feet of the casino which is somehow always between where you are and where you want to go. Great location if you are running the Las Vegas Marathon. Starts at the hotel and ends near the hotel. It's like most things in life you get what you pay for. If you have a choice, the same room that is $400+ on a Saturday night during a convention weekend, might only be $100 or less mid week. You can pay your air fare with the savings on your room price if you are flexible- So make the reservations AFTER you check airfares."

The restaurant the Rum Jungle is closed and sits empty... so sad. We ate at a sushi restaurant that was great and had a few drinks at the bar that were perfect! With all the new hotels and restaurants in town, Mandalay Bay Resort is too far away from all the action. You pretty much need to take a cab to get around. If you like to walk around, stay further down the strip. I felt like all the people who stayed here just needed a cheap room."

    "content": "This was my 3rd time in a row celebrating New Years Eve in Vegas, and I had a blast as per usual. Mandalay Bay is somewhat of an average resort; it doesn't blow you away but it doesn't disappoint either. For the price we paid, I think Mandalay is a very reasonable choice for all it offers. Positives: - Tram is connected directly to hotel - More affordable than other modern hotels on the strip - The pool /beach club is amazing & complimentary - Amazing view from hotel - They don't put a ridiculous 'first night' hold/ deposit on your card like a lot of hotels do now - Due to location; its away from craziness/ bustle of center strip Negatives: - Queen beds were very small - A bit on the far end of the strip towards the south - Resort fee is pricey at $20/ day + taxes - Hotel staff refused to charge my phone for me [forgot my charger at home] - Baggage staff gave me incorrect info; he stated I didn't have to reserve an airport shuttle in advance because they came to the hotel every few minutes. I then find out last minute this was NOT the case; you do have to reserve in advance [especially if you are traveling in the evening/ night] - Elevators to hotel room are a bit hidden/ hard to find - There isn't as much entertainment/ options within the resort compared to other hotels Although Mandalay Bay is a nice hotel; there just isn't anything exceptional about it. You could get basically the same thing at another hotel with a better location on the strip. I would probably only recommend this hotel to families who prefer to have some distance away from the center strip."

The casino seemed really quiet (as in few people) when we were there and other casinos were much busier. This had it's pro's and con's. After spending the afternoon at MGM, it was kind of nice to come back to Mandalay for a little more peace and quiet (for Vegas anyway). My summary would be I wouldn't stay here if I had my choice, but it was fine since it was much more convenient for those attending a show there."

We chose a 'Strip view' location and were very happy with the view - as well as the Strip, we could see planes taking off and landing at the very close McCarran Int'l. No noise issues tho. I'm not a gambler and I liked the fact that The Mandalay Bay is at the end of the Strip - it's less crowded than most of the other big hotels. However, this meant it's more of a trek to get to the others - it's at the lower end of the 2-3 mile long road that makes up the Strip. We enjoyed our stay but there are some (relatively unimportant for us) negatives which may affect your choice: No coffee or tea making facility in the room There's a stocked minifridge - too expensive for us. We put a couple of cokes in the fridge and found them removed after the cleaner had been thru. The gym is very, very limited We had to wait one hour for room service but the food was excellent Breakfast not included in room cost and is quite pricey to buy separately. We went to off-strip McDonalds to get reasonable value for our family. Overall a great experience for 2 days."

They claim there is fine print allowing the switch and that rooms (reserved months in advance) are not always availalbe on arrival!?! The glittering reviews are mostly buffs by employees. Mandalay bay is well removed from the 'center' of the strip - and they take advantage of it - by offering overpriced food which is not the best quality. The buffet runs 3 meals a day - they have no qualms about reheating old food from a prior day's buffet. While other strip resorts have food courts which allow the lower priced meal, - not manadaly. Being removed from the strip they believe they have a captive audience. Also beware the 'add on' charges they are famous for - while the price looks great - with the add-ons you could have stayed in a better resort (bellagio, venitian, etc) with a much better central location. I will not stay at mandalay again, there is nothing exceptional about it."

Fortunately we had the confirmation email but this took over 40 minutes to sort out with the clerk checking frequently with her manager and then they tried to move us to the Hotel next door that did not have a jacuzzi tub. We were very assertive and they ended up honouring our reservation but we are unsure now whether we will return to this hotel.

That said, in the past couple of years, Johnny K. has provided us with Limo pickup from the airport, gift bastkets in the room, very expensive free tickets to see the Eagles, Eric Clapton, and Stevie Winwood at the MGM. I began going 9 years ago, averaging one trip a year. I've almost always come home with more money than I started with, and after expenses. Love that gambling, and the free meals come with it, too. With such a nice, beautiful, and free place to go to, we rarely venture out to other parts of Vegas. (except to ride Fast Carts or indoor skydive, maybe) The only problem, our Host, Johnny has gone elsewhere after 9 years. We miss him! Well, best wishes, and good luck all, I can't wait for my next rip back."

I've tried several and my all-time favorites are China Grill, Fleur, the Burger Bar and the Noodle Shop! The Burger Bay is amazing and while the location is a little tricky to find, once you're there you'll love it - the \"build your own burger\" makes us all expert chefs. For breakfast (and family dining) I always enjoy \"The Cafe.\" During my last visit I ate breakfast there for 5 days in a row. The servers and staff called me by name after my 2nd visit and from then on, I was a family friend to all. So, explore and enjoy the Mandalay Bay and lastly, don't forget to stop at Red Square.

The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are great. There is a lot of different things to do and restaurants to eat at. I highly recommend the House of Blues restaurant and the buffet restaurant they have is pretty good (a little pricey though). I also recommend Minus 5 Lounge. It is a great experience! Everything is made out of ice, even the glasses for the drinks! Some people may not like the fact that this hotel is at the end of the strip but I didn't mind it. There is the tram that takes you to the Luxor and Excalibur and then from there you can walk over to the MGM Grand where the Monorail starts and goes all the way up the strip. The Mandalay Bay has a nice beach and pool area that looks like it would be awesome in the warmer months. The service was great and the lady at the front desk who checked us in did everything she could to get us a high floor (even though we said we didn't mind being on a lower floor). The only issues I had with this hotel was that the rooms were kind of dark even though it was sunny out and we had our curtains fully open. Also, the number of elevators does not accomodate the number of guests who are staying at the hotel. There were many times where we had to wait 5 minutes or more for an elevator. However, this didn't come as a surprise since it was the New Years weekend so it is obviously going to be busier than usual. Overall, Mandalay Bay is a great place to stay!"

Our room had a door to the one next door and not sure if that was why but the walls seemed very thin...and the family next door seemed loud. The hotel itself is great - nice bars and restaurants - can recommend the food and cocktails in Red Square. Minus 5 is also awesome - worth the experience. And Ri Ra always good for \"the morning after the night before\" Irish breakfast. Hotel service was good - helpful, friendly staff. Shark Reef was also worth a visit. I think the beach/pool would be fab in the warmer months. Have stayed at The Venetian and The Bellagio before - also good :) I'd say Manadlay Bay ranks between the two - with The Bellagio being top. It is at the airport end of the strip so we did a lot of walking back and forth. However, we were tipped off about the Express Bus outside the hotel (the other side of the road) that takes you up and down The Strip (bargain $7 for 24hr pass!). If you are nt too proud to ride the bus this is the way forward!"

This is definetly a 5 star experience. The rooms are fantastic and the hotel its self is beautiful. The pools are a little cold but they are so fun! The wave pool is very fun and the lazy river. Probably the best pools in vegas!! We always stay here because we get a good price and we love it. I recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone!!"

Botqh are interconnected thro the parking level.Fabulous property. Taxis are always available at the main entrance. We had booked 2 rooms and she gave us 2 large suites with a bedroom , bathroom and living room with coffee maker in each room. They didn't have connecting rooms but they were opposite each other. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. The casino at the hotel was very good. This is thE first hotel on the strip so it is a long walk to the other places on the strip. The hotel has very good restaurants but we couldn't get reservations in them because they we booked for private parties. The coffee shop in the lobby of The Hotel is the closest to get some breakfast in the morning. The outlet mall is a 10 minute drive from the hotel and has really good stores . It doesn't have a supermarket or pharmacy. If you go out through the travel pick up area at the basement of mandalay bay resort and once you cross the road you have a big Mcdonalds, panda express - serving Chinese food and a wine store which sells water and juices. The children enjoyed the food t panda express and also we could buy water at the wine store. Overall a good place to stay with children."

Some minor noise from the airport was easily tolerable, especially since the air traffic diminished greatly at night. The location near the airport is a plus for travel to/from the airport, but also a minus at the end of the strip. Can't comment about the pools as they were closed for the season, but the cardio room that is included with the resort fee is a joke. Spend the extra for the spa if you are serious about working out- there are saunas, steam room, and showers there as well. Ate at the cafe, Starbucks, the Asian noodle place, and the cafe at The Hotel which were all ok, albeit pricey. All in all, MB is good if you are looking for a cut above the lower level casino (and get a good price!), but does not quite reach the cachet of the top-tier casino hotels like Bellagio, Venetian, or Wynn."

The casino area is well laid out and it is easy to navigate the property. Rooms are OK, rather functional, what you would expect from a La Quinta Inn. Try to stay from the rooms facing the airport nearby, otherwise the helicopters will wake you up at seven in the morning. Be forewarned because the people at the front desk will tell you that your room faces \"the swiming pools\" (rather than the airport). Excellent selection of good restaurants, most of them within a minute's walk from each other. The hotel books good shows and has the shark aquarium. In sum, a good medium-sized hotel for first timers who do not want to be overwhelmed by everything that Las Vegas has to offer."

Great restaurants, an amazing pool, and a huge casino. -The hotel rooms are a lot larger than most of the others in Vegas. With huge floor to ceiling windows. In addition the bathrooms are huge with marble accents everywhere. Something else you get in the room that is not seen very much anymore is Shampoo, lotion, conditioner, shower gel, shower cap, bar soap, facial bar soap, and a sewing kit all in the gift box that comes with the room. Also a full mini bar that includes a full size bottle of grey goose vodka, and tequila. -The casino is large, and has every table game you can think of. The dealers are friendly as are the pit bosses. The games have some of the better rules in town. The poker room and sports book are huge and very comfortable. -The pool is officially the biggest in Vegas and they make sure to really brag about that at Mandalay. It has a full wave pool, lazy river, 2 lagoon pools, and topless pool. Have to pay extra to get into that last one. -The best buffet I have had so far to date in Vegas -The mix lounge is on the 60th floor and it offers some of the best views of Vegas. You can see up the entire strip from this club. Bring your camera! Cons -Really the only con that really comes to mind is the fact that you pay for all the goodies that come from the hotel. But that makes sense considering the hotel has to pay for all the extras like an amazing pool and a huge hotel. So make sure the hotel can really fit your budget. -The only other small con, and this is really only for the hard core gamblers out there was I was a little disappointed with the slot selection. Don't get me wrong they had more slots then the average Vegas casino, but when I consider just how big the property is and how it is one of the best joints in town I would have expected even more slots considering. But that is a very small con. You can still have hours and hours of fun playing slots."

The facility was very clean and neat, and my room was fantastic. I believe for the money, you can't get a more spacious room at a newer hotel than Mandalay Bay. Being that I was there on a busy weekend, I had no troubles with noise or crowds. Of course, I was there in January, which is probably not the busiest time of the year in Vegas. The restaurants within the hotel are spendy, but good. I recommend going to Strip Steak. The average tab is $110, but if you want to save some $, order the American Kobe Burger for $25. It's incredible. The duck fat fries that come with it are also great. I've been to vegas about 8 times, and have stayed at several different hotels over the years. I'd say Mandalay Bay is the best hotel you can get for the price that is clean, spacious, quiet and comfortable. I look forward to my stay with them again in 2012."

Yes, they were very nice, but the chairs are bunched up tightly; and the pool area was swarmed with people. Additionally, they must chill the water, because it was uncomfortably cold (the outside air temperature was in the mid 90's). Checking in took an hour (very long lines of people waiting - it was like a packed bus station). We were told we would get a room with a pool view; but instead got to see the top of some palm trees, and a small glimpse of water mostly hidden by the corner of another building. The worst part of the room was when the bands were playing at night on the stage near the wave pool; they are very annoying if you want a little peace and quiet at night. Long waits for elevators, and they were packed most of the time. The hotel is on the end of the strip, and the center of town is quite a hike. Food and drinks at the hotel are VERY expensive. I would not recommend this place unless you are younger with a group of party minded people, or have children that love the water; and are not put off by herds of people."

So we immediately asked to be moved back but was told our original room was no longer available and in fact, not a single King was now available unless we wanted to \"upgrade\". But because this room looked less than clean, they moved us to another double on the 22nd floor which looked better but still was rather depressing. But I had a hard time accepting that no Kings were available since the resort looked fairly empty so I went downstairs and spoke with the front desk, and suddenly a King opened up.They also gave us a $25.00 hotel credit for all of our \"trouble\". This was a total of 4 rooms we had been shuffled through! The next morning my husband realized he had left behind some items in one of the rooms. Again I went downstairs and was told that all 3 of the rooms were still empty (this was after being told our original room was reserved which would of saved us a great deal of trouble). They gave me a one time key for each room and we ended up finding the items in a drawer in the first King room. The positives....the bathrooms are wonderful, large with a great shower and a tv to watch while soaking in the tube. The buffet was excellent (we had a $100 hotel credit in addition to the $25.00 they gave us over the room shuffel) so other than a few drinks we didn't end up paying for meals. And we liked the \"elegance\" of the lobby and overall all the staff was professional and polite. And the planes do start calming down around 11:00 PM or so and with our earplugs which we always have with us when we travel, the airport ended up not being the issue we thought it might be. But with all of the newer hotels on the other end of strip, MB certainly is showing it's age. Still, I found it much nicer than the Mirage for the same rate. I think almost all of the resorts now charge a \"resort fee\" of $20.00 plus tax. And as with almost all of the resorts if you want a strip view be prepared to pay more for it. The only thing the resorts don't charge you for are the self-parking garages which are fairly easy to navigate."

Also, there was very slow response in getting our requests to have extra bedding and our internet issues address. Having people coming to our room around 10 to 11 at night while my newphew is trying to sleep is not ok. Front Desk did their best and did compensate for the inconvenience. I thank them for that.

The room was extremely clean, the bathroom was emaculate, and I liked really liked the layout of the bathroom area. There was no coffee maker, which is always disappointing, but I am noticing that I am not seeing that in Vegas at the hotels. The internet was an extra cost each day to use it. The Wi-fi was fast and easy to connect in the hotel room. I was having some problems with the Television, and they were very quick in helping me over the phone with the situation. The Mandalay is huge and it takes long walks to get to many areas of the hotel. So I would suggest bringing very comfortable shoes, especially if you are walking from your room to the convention areas. The staff was friendly at check-in, and very professional. While staying here I went to the Michael Jackson Tribute show playing at the Mandalay, and it was excellent but costly."

This is the first time I commented on how the rooms were getting tired; scratches and worn furniture seem the norm now. I would really want this hotel to continue to get my business but with newer hotels closer to the center of the strip I'm sure I will make it a point to stay at the Mandarin or Cosmo next time I'm in LV.

    "content": "We booked this hotel for early Dec 2011, and got a terrific rate, so right off the bat, we were pretty satisfied with our \"find\". We wanted a 4 star hotel, but did not feel like paying a fortune. Check in to the hotel was fast and efficient. The woman at the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful. Our room, on the 23rd floor, was large, beautifully decorated, comfortable,with a nice mini bar, a desk, a couch, etc. We were very impressed. Needless to say it was very clean, no smell of smoke, and the walls were thick enough so we did not hear any noises from other rooms. The best part of the room, was the bathroom!! It was huge with a tub, separete shower, and toilet, two sinks and a TV inside. The only downside of the room was that the bed was a little too soft so it sunk in a bit in the middle. As wonderful as our room was, I cannot say the same about the hotel itself. Although it is very nice, there seems to be no \"environment\". Nothing happening. Just a plain old hotel in the middle of the strip. Where other hotels in Vegas are full of restaurants, people, activities, and their themes are more than apparent, the Mandalay Bay seems like a Hilton or a Marriot in X Ville Nevada! The Casino is large but empty and with little thrills. Also, this hotel is located on the furthest end of the strip, so be prepared to walk or take a taxi everywhere. There is a train that takes you to the Luxor and Excalibur as well. I really did not stay in the hotel much because it really seemed dead. Even for breakfast we went to the New York New York or the Caesar's which seem full of like in comparison. Overall I would say this hotel is great if you are looking for a more quiet and relaxed trip to LAs Vegas, but if you want to feel the excitement, stay elsewhere."

Granted, the hot girls were great eye candy, but the 3am wake ups with slamming doors and yelling didn't sit well with us. Called front desk 2 nights in a row and they would send up security as soon as they become available (in other words, \"screw you sir, this is Vegas\") Haha. I would say the rude awakenings were the only issue we had. The room was otherwise fantastic. Paid $65/night! (some deal through Southwest). What a bargain! Too bad I dropped over $300 in the spa for my wife and I. The Mandalay Spa is above all others I've visited (about 4 total). We also enjoyed the restaurant selection and table games in the casino."

They sent us an offer to comp a couple of room nights ( and upgrade us to a suite based on availability)and we figured we'd book a few more nights and celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary! They gave us the \"player's rate\" for the additional nights (which ended up being almost twice the rate that they were offering online), but we figured with the suite upgrade it would be worth it. I phoned two days before our trip to confirm the reservation, advise them we were staying for our anniversary and check to see the likelihood of an upgrade. The agent on the VIP line indicated she would make a note on our file and hold a suite room for us, especially since we would be arriving quite late. She said things are really slow at this time of year and it wouldn't be a problem. Long story short(er), when we arrived there was no doorman or bellman to greet us, and no assistance with our luggage (strike one), the front desk clerk let us sit in line while she gossiped and barely acknowledged us (it was not busy at all...strike two), she then told us the only room they had was a regular room with two queen sized beds. I explained what I had done to confirm the reservation and she said nothing was there, and that since VIP promotions had made the offer, she and her manager had nothing to do with it. (strike three). Not wanting to create a scene, I asked her to have a manager from VIP promotions contact me in my hotel room...no call ever came. Unfortunately not a great start to the trip...but it was a sign of a general decline in the Mandalay Bay brand. The room we had looked tired. It had scuffed marks on the walls, wallpaper that was coming off the walls in the corners, a big black cigarette burn blotch on the wall in the bathroom, and red stains on the wall of the bathroom that might have been blood. Ewwww :-( On the plus side, and the main reason we stay at Mandalay Bay, the restaurants were still quite good. We enjoyed Verandah (technically at the Four Seasons, but connected to MB), Fleur, Aureole, and the Bayside Buffet. I'll write separate reviews on the dining :-) The other highlight was the spa services at The Bathhouse at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. Don't bother with the spa at Mandalay Bay though, it is tired and dated... I've seen MB advertise room rates at the time we went at around 49-69 dollars (weekday/weekend). If I had paid that rate and was expecting a standard room I would be fine with things (after the room was cleaned). I was just so disappointed with the check in, that it soured my experience and impression of MB. With all the newer resorts in Vegas now, It just seems like they have accepted they are a middle of the road resort and act accordingly. I think we will give one of those newer resorts a try on our next trip."

The room was excellent,large,beautiful view,bathroom with twin basins,wonderfull shower, bath etc all spotless. Room service and housekeeping were both quick when one considers this hotel has 3,250 rooms! The restaurants are good, we liked the Irish pub Ri Ra ( good steak) and the Noodle Shop (nice Kung Po chicken) Being Scottish we like our cup of tea first thing in the morning but alas no kettle, no problem quick phone call to housekeeping and a water boiler was delivered to our room,brilliant. The staff were very helpfull nothing was too much trouble, and above all so very friendly when asked for help or advice.

There was a small refrigerator that was stocked with high-priced goodies but there was a little room so I could keep a bottle of water cool. Of course, like most Vegas hotels, no coffee maker or tea. You could get one for free from housekeeping but I think the cost was around $4 per bag of coffee. Of course there are a couple of places to score java on the ground floor including a Starbucks. Bring your coffee and tea from home along with a way to boil water. \"Eye Candy,\" the nighclub on the casino floor, was a lot of fun but $10 cocktails is a little steep. Still, good music and a nice atmposhere. The new Michael Jackson tribute show is at the hotel and hundreds of people traversed the casino floor every night to check it out. The House of Blues is also on the casino floor - good food and entertainment. The buffet at the hotel is a little expensive compared to others in town but high-quality. Breakfast was like $15 and very good. I would also recommend the restaurants in the mall that connects the hotel to the Luxor. The Burger Bar and the Mexican place called \"Hussongs\" are REALLY good! So is the Border Grill back in the convetnion area of the hotel along with a little food court. Across the street is a Panda Express and McDonald's but there is also a McDonald's inside the Luxor on the second level - it's kind of hidden. Of course, the sand beach is beautiful but it was closed for the season. There was a smaller pool open with large jacuzzi hot tubs. While there is a full spa/gym, there is an additional cost. That said, there is a small \"cardio gym\" with several good quality machines that was free to access and staffed. Nice touch!"

They insisted they always do it this way, but again, it says that nowhere on the confirmation. In my case, it was a company-paid trip, and I did not have the card, so I had to locate my boss, who fortunately was there and had it, or else I would have been out-of-pocket. Rooms were OK, but a non-smoking room was just that, the room only, not a non-smoking wing, so I could smell smoke from other rooms the whole night. But the hotel is vast; how'd they ever design something that takes so long to get from one end to the other? The rooms are at one end of the hotel, the convention and meeting rooms, where I had two business shows, are at the other, not kidding, must be a half-mile walk. And we had to do it a couple of times a day. Way, way inconvenient. In between are numerous really overpriced restaurants and, of course, the casino, which is where they really want you to stop. They literally need a shuttle to get from rooms to conventions. Elevators were very slow and sometimes had long lines - just to get on an elevator. Are they kidding? There were several other big expos going on and that made it worse. Not a great hotel, and I heard that a comparable nearby Strip hotel was charging a fraction of the room rate."

The hotel is the last major hotel on the strip, making it quite the walk to the middle of the strip. If you're going for a few days, try renting a car on hotwire (I got one for $13 per day + tax). It's nice to have a car to visit Hoover Dam and off strip locations. Parking was free at Mandalay Bay. Valet is also available. Taxis and tours can get expensive."

    "content": "I just spent 4 nights at the Mandalay Bay for a convention and was disappointed overall, although in fairness, I'm being a bit nit-picky. I would say that the place aims at the 2nd tier of Hotels in Vegas - somewhere below the Bellagio, the Venetian, the Wynn and Encore, and above Treasure Island, New York New York, Monte Carlo. Probably on the same level as the Mirage. But if you want a really nice place, you're better off staying in the former, and otherwise you may as well make do with the latter! The room was ok - very large and fairly well appointed. The bed was horribly soft though and the other furniture also wasn't particularly comfortable. Really missing was a nice comfortable chair for the desk. When I have work to do, I need a good sturdy upright chair, not a lounge chair. The bathroom was large, but really nothing fancy. Very vanilla. Its not a bad place, it just lacks a certain atmosphere that other resorts up and down the strip have. The casino itself is absolutely enormous, but very spread out and it makes it feel a bit empty. Call me strange but when it comes to Vegas casinos, I prefer a place that is crowded and noisy. Another issue is the location. Its the most southern resort on the strip, so its a bit isolated. You can walk through to the Luxor and the Excalibur without breathing outside air (thats about 10000 hotel rooms by my calculation) or you can take a tram straight through to the corner where the Excalibur meets New York New York, and even then you're really only on the tip of the action on the strip. There are some great restaurants - we ate at the Burger Bar, China Grill, Red White and Blue, all very good. The convention facilities are also impressive, although its such a long walk from the rooms that you feel like you may as well have stayed elsewhere on the strip. I wouldn't choose to stay at the Mandalay Bay in the future if i have the choice. I just think there is better value, location and atmosphere to be had at other places."

    "content": "I have stayed at Mandalay Bay a few times- always for work-related conferences. While located at one end of the Las Vegas Strip, I personally prefer its' closer proximity the airport and the reality is....everything is accessible in Vegas for the most part. Nice, spacious rooms- pretty up-to-date. Bathrooms are large and fairly bright. The added TV in the bathroom is a great added touch. Lighting in the bathroom could be a bit better for \"make-up\" - but there is magnifying mirror, which helped a bit. Some great restaurants located in the casino area. I ate at China Grill my final night- very good food and cocktails. I ate at Noodles for lunch one day, which was just \"ok\". Room service was very good, but VERY long waits for it to arrive. They do warn you in advance of the room service wait times, but in my opinion- when traveling for business 60-75 minutes is simply not acceptable. They recommend \"pre ordering\" your room service the night prior, but I attempted to do this twice and was told that they no longer had \"availability\" to deliver during my preferred times. They offered me 9:40am as the earliest\u2026.doesn\u2019t work when you have to get to work. The hotel really needs to consider their staffing levels in room service when there is a convention/business travelers are in town. Overall the staff was generally friendly and tried to do the right thing....I just suspect that they are limited since the hotel is SO large and so busy. I would still recommend Mandalay Bay. Nice rooms, decent location and one of the best for atmosphere/\"life\" in the casino area."

There is a tram to Excalibur, but it\u2019s still a walk through that casino & beyond. Restaurants are high-priced, nothing close to inexpensive at this hotel. Minimums for all table games are $10-15 dollars. It\u2019s a pain to have to take the shuttle to Excalibur every day/night to gamble.

We stayed here as part of Team Challenge for the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, so we got a room that had extra nights for ~$130/night. Highlights: -The staff at the check in desk was friendly and helpful. We didn't have too much interaction with any of the other staff, except the guy who brought us our room service. -The room was spacious and clean. I wish it had a refrigerator, though (besides the mini bar). -There is a free tram that connects this hotel to Luxor and Excalibur. It's pretty convenient if you want to save yourself from walking a bit to get to the other parts of the Las Vegas strip. -There are plenty of places to eat within the hotel. We ate breakfast at Red, White, and Blue and had a lunch at Raffles Cafe. If I had to choose between the two, I'd say Red, White, and Blue had better food. (But I think Raffles is open 24 hours, in case you're looking for something to eat late at night.) -The hotel is not far from the famous Las Vegas sign. Probably about 3/4 of a mile at most. Lowlights: -The TVs in the room are unusually slow. It takes a few seconds to switch between each channel. -The elevators are slow. Eight elevators go from floors 17-30something but they take forever. There were frequently long lines of people waiting to go up to their rooms. One time, one of the staff even took a handful of us to a service elevator because the line was getting so long. -The hotel itself is located at the very south end of the strip. This means that if you want to see the rest of the strip or just take a cab to the other end, you've got a long way to go. -The shops located at Mandalay Place aren't all too great. I'd definitely go back to Mandalay Bay in the future."

    "content": "I booked to stay at the Mandalay Bay because it was situated at the start and finish line of the Las Vegas Marathon and I had entered the race. It would not have been my first choice having read a lot of the prior reviews but as it turned out, other than a few glitches, it wasn't bad. There were other events taking place at this hotel including a cowboy/rodeo meet so it was pretty busy. I stayed on the 9th floor. They had tried to give me a 32nd floor room but having heard about the elevators, I wanted a lower room. I never encountered any real elevator related delays but they are slow. My room was pleasant and facing west so that I could see the sun set on the mountains every night. Having stayed at Bellagio before, it was nice to be down at the end of the strip where it is less hectic and loud. I had a great bed which cradled my tired and sore body after the run resulting in a great sleep. As well, the bed linens are high thread count and feel nice. The heat control in the room was accurate and helped to keep out the cold as it was quite unseasonable while I was there. My check in and check out were smooth and I was able to retain my room until 1PM on the day of my departure just by asking. The room was basically clean enough but there were some stains on the carpet which had been unsuccessfully cleaned. The carpets in the hallways look a bit tired but I imagine it is a serious undertaking and expense to change these. I'm sure it will happen eventually. The hotel itself was no different than many others on the strip. A waterfall feature out front, the pool area has a beach but was closed, the casino has an assortment of games and tables but was much smokier than others I visited. Perhaps their air handling equipment is inefficient. I didn't use the gym as I ran outside each day. The WIFI in the room worked very well, much better than at some hotels I have stayed at. I ate at the buffet once and the food was not very appetizing. The place has a weird smell that is very off-putting. Maybe it is a cleaning solution or something but it made me feel ill. Would I stay there again? Not likely. Each Las Vegas hotel is a different experience so I would likely try a different place. This was just a convenient place to stay this time."

There is a Starbucks off the casino, but there were long lines there every morning. Ordering room service coffee required an hour wait. I did hear of people actually going out and buying coffee makers for their room! The cardio center, which comes as part of the daily $15 resort fee, is small and not all the equipment was working. Business people often get up early to work out and I saw many people come to work out, only to see a line of others waiting to use the equipment. There is another gym available to use but that is an additional $25 fee."

You can walk around in the lobby and casino freely without crowds which was a nice change from staying at other resorts on the strip. The room was pretty average for a Vegas hotel, along with a nice bug soaker tub. The bad thing was the pool hours, it closes so darn early! The pool closed at 6pm daily which seemed a little early to me, especially since there was still daylight for a few more hours. A serious downfall is the resort fee! When you stay at any MGM property there is a hidden resort fee of $25 PER DAY which was basically for nothing! You do not get anything extra for this fee, but they all charge it. Seeing as how MGM owns half of the LV strip it is a little hard to get away from. The pool hours, and the resort fees are the reason I gave this resort 3 stars. Otherwise, the amenities are good (unlike its immediate northern neighbors) and its pretty low key"

I also asked about certain housekeeping issues and they were resolved. Even though those issues happened, I would stay here again.

This was our first stay at Mandalay, we have visited Vegas numerous times, but have never stayed here. Check in went well, the gentleman that helped me was kind. Our room was nice, and we had a superb view of the strip! The one pool area that was open this time of year was overcrowded, maybe due to the holiday.....but anyhow, this made enjoying the one hot tub rather annoying, you really could not ever get a spot to sit!! No one ever got out!! Otherwise, the pool and hot tub were a nice set up. Had a few issues, one with the safe, and one with charges to my credit card that were not valid (that is annoying!!!). Our safe was shut when we got into the room, and one cannot set a code or use the safe unless it is open. So, I had to phone for someone to open it.... which took two attempts, because the first time he came, we were already out of the room due to plans. They cannot reset it without you there when they open it. Second time around I called and told them to come while I was in the room!! The charges to my card issue is just so dumb, I checked out at 5am, was told no extra charges, and everything looked good. When I got home there suddenly was an email telling me there was an extra charge noted the day we left, for COOKIES!!!! from the in room bar. UUUmmmm NO!!! first of all, we were gone, and secondly we NEVER touched a thing from the mini bar. How convienent we get a charge after we leave! Guess the maid got hungry!!!! Good news .... I did get the charge of 8.65 for cookies reversed after speaking to a nice lady in the accounting department. But of course I had to put in the work and effort to get that done, but to me it was just the principal of it. We did not go near the minibar, so don't be dishonest and charge us. Well, with that problem fixed, I am feeling that I left with a better feeling and most likely will return to the Mandalay."

I have stayed twice at the MGM for trade shows, and I can tell you the MB is MUCH nicer, albeit a little more expensive. My $199 rate included a \"resort fee\" which was a bit pointless considering I was there in November and the pool was closed. However, I was able to take advantage of the \"aerobic fitness room\" (treadmills, lifecycles - all with TVs). And wireless Internet was also included. Performance was decent, though range was poor in the casino. The room was nice, but doesn't have that luxurious feel with high ceilings you get at the Wynn. One thing I will say is that in many of the rooms, you can look out and see McCarran airport right out your window. That made for a short cab ride from the airport (beware crooked cabbies - this should be a $15 ride, not $20-25!!!!). On the other hand, I was surprised to find that there actually was some plane noise in my room - so I was hearing planes even at midnight and up until 1am in the morning. So a little more noise insulation would have been nice. I know what you're thinking - 1am in Vegas, I should be out right? Well, hey I'm getting old. Bottom line, I've stayed at about a dozen places in Vegas. Wynn still tops out as best, though Venetian, Caeasar's Palace, and Mandalay Bay were all very nice. A notch below is New York New York, MGM and Ballys. And high on the cheese factor is Circus Circus and Excalibur. So if you DO stay at MB, couldn't hurt to ask about a room on the side facing AWAY from the airport."

The convention center is attached to the hotel and you can get there using wide hallways without having to pick your way through rows of slot machines. The machines are there, of course, but just not in the way."

We found our room about average, but considering the reasonable price we paid (a two nights/get a third free discount), we were well-satisfied. Service at the front desk was a bit slow, but pleasant. The weather was a bit too chilly for us to use the pool, but since the pool area was packed with young children, we probably wouldn't have used it anyway. The hotel is located on the airport end of the strip, and while it was well insulated from flight noises, it was a bit removed from the main part of the strip. There are a few excellent restaurants on site; we particularly liked Alain Ducasse's Mix on the top floor with a great view of the city. Since it was a first trip to Las Vegas, and since the city itself holds no special appeal for us, it is unlikely that we will return. If we should, we might consider staying here again, but would probably try another hotel just for a new experience."

There was a master remote control for the drapes (floor to ceiling windows), lights, music and tvs. The deluxe rooms have beds and pillows that are very comfortable. We usually stay mid-week, and the room rates are very reasonable at $60 (although the Vista Suite was a splurge at $300 per night and we took advantage of an offer that gave us the 3rd night free). The hotel website frequently has deals. On this trip, we got $100 food credit for staying 2 or more nights. The restaurants are consistently high quality, although pricey. At home, I purchased 3 restaurant.com certificates for $4 each to save $50 off three separate $100 tabs at the Noodle House, Raffles Cafe and The Cafe (which is in the adjoining The Hotel). The all day buffet is a good deal at $43 pp, and the last time we stayed, the room offer included 2 all day buffets. The resort is clean and well maintained. We will stay here again."

And there was no coffee machine in the room! It was a very long walk to all the restaurants, and you have to skirt the casino to get there. We were charged a resort fee (we knew this in advance) but we didn't know that all the pools were closed- only hot tub was in the spa, and it would cost us a $25 spa fee *on top* of the resort fee. We liked the tram line, though it doesn't go very far along the strip. It was a lovely place, but I'd try the Bellagio next I think."

Mandalay Bay was clean, has excellent customer service and I would stay here again. The restaurants were mediocre at best, particularly the buffet and cafe. We did eat dinner at Fleur one night, which was really quite good and I would eat there again. The casino is so-so. I am not a gambler but it was very average looking - not the eye-popping glamour some of the other casinos (Paris, MGM) had. The one thing that was positive is that it didn't reek of cigarette smoke as some of the others did. I would say that the price of this hotel is high compared to what you get for the money. But I do value cleanliness and good customer service, and Mandalay Bay gets high marks in both."

    "content": "We recently extended a conference stay with a vacation at the Mandalay. The Mandalay complex has everything you could want except perhaps easy access to the \"liveliest\" section of The Strip. We didn't mind venturing north to see a few thing because our room was so peaceful and welcoming. We had a car and drove to the Bellagio and back (all of the casinos have free parking). And we were very happy to leave the crowds, the din, and the seediness a mile up The Strip. We had a 750 sq ft room that was nicely appointed (see their website for details) and had a clean and relaxing mid-century modern decor. We were on the 22nd floor facing east. The long wall of floor-to-ceiling windows were great! We heard helicopter tours taking off during the day, but the \"noise\" was very muted. For some reason, our room didn't have a workspace. The round dining sort of table (with four chairs) had to make do, though the curved shape and chair height wasn't the best for typing. Also, we found the wireless to be atrociously slow at times. We didn't gamble, but we did enjoy the many shops and restaurants in the complex. Coming from an almost smoke-free city, we noticed smokers everywhere, but the Mandalay must have an excellent ventilation system because we never really noticed smoke except when walking right past a person smoking. The halls, rooms, and restaurants didn't smell smoky! I agree with others that the elevators (particularly during conference start and finish times) were way overburdened. You could wait a long time at the 22nd floor, but I wouldn't trade the view and privacy for a quicker elevator ride. Reception staff and housekeeping staff were all very friendly and helpful. Only two negatives for us: Our room had an adjoining door to the room next to us. There were people occupying that room only two nights, but we could hear their entire conversations (not just voices, but actual words). This made us uncomfortable. Be sure to request your room doesn't have an adjoining door. The Mandalay Beach was closed for the season! We had reasonably warm, sunny days during our Nov. stay, but the entire place was closed down. There was another small pool open (also outdoors). However, the hours weren't really reasonable for use by conference goers who are occupied during the day. The Mandalay website doesn't say anything about dates the Beach is closed (or at least I never saw them). This could be a huge disappointment to visitors interested in the many features of the Beach."

The maid must have left without taking them. Once inside, we found litter all over the carpet, which meant the room had not been vacuumed. We called the front desk immediately, and fortunately the response was quite swift. The carpet was vacuumed, but the trash and the linen were not removed. We thought, what a decline from those glorious years, when we longed to return to this classy hotel! No wonder it is now only a four-star hotel."

The cleaning staff were excellent, and the room was spotless. I have 3 kids aged 15,12 and 6 and not once did they complain, the facilities were outstanding, providing 24/7 entertainment for adults (Casino, bars etc), plus a huge swimming pool, huge wave machine, private adult only pool and a very cool \"lazy river.\" The hotel has its own miniature subway line from the hotel, to Excalibur, which comes in handy when not wanting to walk.

VERY disappointed with the cardio center, which had opening hours ?? and only 2 bikes which were old and terrible to use this is important to me I like exercising while I am away. The room was very comfortable and no issues with cleanliness although the air conditioning is pretty poor. The most frustrating thing was that the pools had very late opening and early closing hours that was very frustrating I like to exercise and go for a swim afterwards early in the morning and could not use it after the conference because it closed so early. I don't get it, very annoying. Might be back next year, but will be at a Hotel closer to the strip, location is a bit annoying because it is generally a cab ride to the trip and those add up over time. No matter what they say book at table at the Restaurants in the casino itself, or else get frustrated with being told 20 minutes and 45 minutes later you are still waiting, \"Wolfgang puck\"! hope you are listening, very rude. Aureole was very good, have a good appetite and healthy bank balance. Conference facilities were excellent and free wifi was good enough to stream sports."

Internet access was complimentary as was access to the pool and gym facilities. The pool and beach area look spectacular and include a large wave pool and lagoon area, however it was late autumn and too cold to utilise. There is no indoor or heated pool. I was located on the 12th floor; however the view was nothing spectacular looking over the car park and conference facilities roof. I would suggest asking for a pool or strip view room if you value a good view. The hotel is the last on the strip heading out to the south of Vegas, so the location isn't terrific, but there is a monorail that connects you to the Luxor and Excalibur hotels which are closer to the shops and nearby facilities. As a business destination is was great, but perhaps for a vacation destination it was a little out of the way and you would be better off staying further down the strip."

We booked a 'strip view room' a few months in advance, as it was our first time in vegas and decided we had to have a good view. However, upon arrival I reminded them of this and they replied with \"no those rooms are booked out\". I was not happy and complained. They said the best they could do was give us a disabled persons room with a view of the airport and a 20 dollar discount. We had to take it as it was already late evening... The next day I rang and they had apparently found a room with a strip view but after carrying all our luggage down a few floors, the bellman met us at the new room but as he entered there were people still in there. So we went back onto the elevator and changed floors again. This time we did get a room with a strip view for our final two nights. -The new room and all of the hallways smelt like cigarette (I dont know if this is common in vegas?) -The toiletries in the first room were half used. -It felt like bad positioning as the taxi drivers always went around the block to get to any other casino. Some charging up to $15 just to get about halfway up. Although the rooms were very nice (view or no view) I would not stay here again because of the room mix up. It felt very unprofessional."

First, while I'm sympathetic with energy saving, the low wattage CFLs made it impossible to use the desk and the room was grimly dark. Large flat screen (with smaller one in bathroom) have many channels--including seemingly endless ones selling events and activities at MGM hotels. The complex has numerous restaurants at different price points--I was pleased with Charlie Palmer (in the attached Four Seasons), Red Square and Burger Bar. The shopping mall which connects to the more down-market Luxor lacks the upscale shopping found at the Bellagio, Caesar's or the Venetian. Check-in was very slow with little staff for long lines. As other reviewers have noted, there are lengthy waits for elevators--especially in the evening. Located at the end of The Strip, it is very convenient to the airport but away from the most upscale areas. The hotel (like many others) levies an annoying \"resort fee\" in order to advertise low room rates. After a dropped mobile call, I used the in-room phone for a brief call resulting in a $28.29 charge. On check out discovered minbar over-billing which prevented me from using automated check-out. The casino is attractive--although a little smokier than that of the Bellagio. Good hotel for business meeting and good enough for it's price point. I would likely stay further up The Strip if I retuned for a personal visit. On balance, less luxurious than I thought."

No reason to schlep through all the other hotel drop offs. Check in was slow, only because a major Dental convention was checking in at the same time and there were a zillion people with complex billing arrangements for each room.....but we got our room, which was lovely, great view of the pool. Very close to the airport, heard planes and helicoptors all day, even in the room. Food in the hotel and in the adjoining mall area was wonderful. Never had a bad meal, portions were huge, prices were good. We loved the hotel, the food, pools were lovely. But......there is no quiet place anywhere. None. My husband has tinnitus and needs to have relief from noise at times. There was no where to go in the hotel or even in the city to be quiet! He was miserable. Highlight of our trip was seeing Elton John in concert. He was incredible! Hubby said it was worth the noise!! Aggravating.......the pools closed early most days we were there for evening events. I wanted to came back from my day and head to the pool. Couldn't most days. Had a great day trip to the Hoover Dam. Interesting and fun! We are not big gamblers, the casino was fun, I liked it, hubby could not tolerate the noise. Check out was fine. Again, so close to airport we should have taken a cab instead of the shuttle. All in all, fun once, don't need to do LV again!"

My friend said you can request a no fee frig for your room but it's $35. A night! WOW. We only stayed here for the conference but totally not worth it. Beach and pool was closed and the substitute facility was 21+ not not not family friendly! We've stayed at other hotels and this one we will never return to again!

Try the chicken Kiev in Red Square, the chicken Marsala at the Italian restaurant, and the carnitas tacos at the Mexican restaurant. Expect to walk a lot. The resort is huge. Note that the resort is at the south end of the strip. The north end (the Stratosphere) is more than 4 miles away. There is a tram, which I did not try."

I enjoyed the regular pool a lot more; the simulated waves was fun. If I return to Vegas, I definitely would not return to the Mandalay due to location. Checking in and out was horrible; huge lines and long wait time. The restaurants in the hotel were edible but definitely not delicious. The room was very big and the bathroom was huge.

One tip I wanted to share was when you are checking in if they try and put you on the 7th floor tell them to to keep looking for another room. We were put on the 7th floor and it turns out these are the only rooms without floor to ceiling windows and instead have tiny windows with bars on them giving the room all of the ambiance of a prison cell. We asked for a different room and they were happy to switch us to the room we expected."

Several nice shops nearby. A cafe between the Mandalay and THEhotel was great for breakfast. The tram is free and easy to use - gets you partway up the strip. Lots of restaurants nearby. Unfortunately someone walked into my room during one afternoon when I was napping - I didn't have the deadbolt on - I assume it was staff, though the room had already been cleaned and it was late afternoon or early evening. She muttered something and left when I said hello. I used my deadbolt and the safe after that, but it could have been just a mistake."

Dining options in abundance at this hotel, quite pricey but you get what you pay for. Rooms were adequate with great LCD tvs in both bedroom and bathroom.

The service here is consistently good and the staff always make me feel welcome. My best experiences have been with the Dealers and Pit Bosses there; when I first started going to Vegas, I was not sure how to play many of the table games and their staff took the time to work with me so that I learned how to play. I've been there twice this year, and one of The Pit Bosses remembered me from my last trip! This definitely was huge as you just don't get that from other casino's. My favorite restaurant in Vegas is Border Grille, which has an excellent brunch and the service is always good. My favorite view of Vegas is from Mix in the evening. This place is a lounge/club where you can choose if you want to \"club it\" or just sit back, enjoy the view and have a few drinks. Another thing I enjoy about this hotel is their mini-concert area just off the casino floor where you can listen to some really good 80's/90's, rock cover bands for free and drink, dance or just watch and enjoy. I like the location as it is the last hotel on the south end of the strip, away from a lot of the madness... overall, great place that has everything you need for an excellent Vegas vacation!"

I will say it\u2019s a good option for families travelling with kids and for the money I paid, I think it was ok.

Hotel is located at the end of strip but trams are available and off course you will love walking in the strips when you are there for a holiday...

The weather was very cool. Silly me, I checked out everything about my trip, EXEPT for the weather which was in the 40s, had to go and buy some sweaters. Check the temperature before you go. I didnt get to use the pool and the beach and wave pool area looked so inviting. Used the spa which I felt was very reasonably priced and worth every penny, I had a fabulous experience. If you stay here you have to utilize the spa, you wont be sorry. Ate at the noodle house resturant and Red White and Blue, great food and great service. If you want Starbucks coffee in the morning, be warned that this is a very popular spot and early morning there is a line but it moves pretty fast. I didnt expect the hotel to be so smokey. My some free room was wonderful, but you can smoke in the common areas and the cassino parts of the hotels and as I non-smoker, this was hard to deal with. If you walked out of your room everthing you are wearing would smell of smoke. Not the hotel's fault, all the hotels are like that. For a non-gambler, I still had a great time. I could see the airport from my room and that was nice, I thought it was a great view. The beds in my room (both of them) were a bit soft as were the pillows.

Draw back is it is at the end of the strip so tram only takes you so far. Food is very expensive. They also didn't check the mini bar before we checked in and left items on the dresser informing us personal items in the fridge wasn't allowed, well we got there the fridge was locked, since I didn't plan to get anything from the mini bar, I wasn't worried. I did have to get a charge removed for the chips because like I said I wasn't spending $5 a can. Also they tell you to conserve water to hang your towels up and they would be replaced every 3rd day, ours were replaced daily no matter how I hung them up, just thought it was strange since I did what I was supposed to. Casino is very smelly from the smoke. Quite a difference from Monte Carlo that didn't smell like smoke. We were there for a convention. Pool area was nice, sign says each guest needs to show room key and my husband went back to get his only to find out that when mine was scanned his wasn't needed. Hotel is huge and a walk to anything is going to take more than 5-10 mins depending where you want to eat. Loved the Reef."

We had a family room - which very well equipped and furnished and over looked the southern part of The Strip. I have been to countries that aren't as big as this hotel! This was our base for las Vegas and beyond which included day trips to Grand Canyon West and the canyon walkway (that'll cost you more than you expected (!), the Hoover Dam and Death Valley. Anyway, back to the hotel ... huge choice of restaurants, several pools, on-site aquarium, shops, show theatre... the list goes on. It is very convenenient for McCarran Aiport (being at the bottom end of The Strip), and the central part of The Strip is not far if you take the tram (a cable-driven monorail-type train really) that connects the Mandalay Bay with The Luxor and Escalibur - and then take the new monorail that links up all other major hotels and casinos going north. My only dislikes were the inability to see the outside world from the hotel casino and restaurant areas that occupy a hige expanse of the ground floor, which made me a little claustrophobic. I really just wanted to get outside to feel the sun on my back - even if it the outside temperature was in the high 30s (celcious) ! It seems to take ages to find a way out of this place! There is not a lot to fault this place. Would I stay here again? Yes, very probabaly."

However, it was nice to have all the restaurants and shows close by when I wanted to hit the strip. The tram to and from the Excalibur was nice to get to the middle of the strip.

The resort has a large Aquarium within it with 2 large walk through tubes for viewing all the fishes ($18.00 per adult). All the Casino's have live shows and this one currently is running The Lion King. There is a free monorail connecting this resort to The Luxor and onto Excalibur, not a huge distance, but after walking down The Strip all day it's a bit of help to make it back. It also gives you access to other Resorts facilities and eateries, some considerably cheaper than the Mandalay. And of course there is the Casino, but that's up to you. All in all a great destination resort, would definitely return. One word of warning, the mini bar is wired , touch it and you bought it, but the Reception staff is understanding and happily fixes it, make sure to check your room Bill carefully."

There are plenty of choices both in the Hotel and Mandalay Place, the shopping center attached to the hotel. We also went up the the House of Blues Foundation Room on the top floor of the hotel for Happy Hour, which was a really awesome view of the strip. I highly recommend doing that as well. The only bad thing i can say is that the rooms are getting a little worn out and tired looking these days. The furniture is starting to look worn out and the couch in the room was getting a bit shabby as well. Still a very nice room, great service, and the hotel and the casino area is very nice as well. Hopefully they will start to update the rooms soon! For the price you cant really beat the Mandalay."

    "content": "Stayed for 5 days for a conference. Everything was very good, except for the cigarette smoke in the casino -- you see, everywhere you go, you need to go through the casino. If smoke makes you sick, try to pick a non-casino non-smoking hotel such as the Vdara. Check-in was very fast compared to other Vegas hotels, but check-out was much more slower. The room was clean and bathroom also clean and spacious. Big tub but not jetted. Like other reviewers have said, the furniture in the room is a bit chipped and old, but I am the kind of person who can overlook that. No fridge in the room and the rules explicitly say not to use the mini bar for personal items. One additional piece of information that may not be useful to many, but may be for some business travelers seeking reimbursement: Mandalay Bay gift cards used at checkout to pay for part of the balance appear on the receipt as \"Mastercard\" with no mention of it being a gift card. The Mandalay Bay - Excalibur tram service was a life saver and it runs every 5 minutes or less. They also provide free boarding pass printing from the computers in the lobby by the Concierge. More computers are in the Convention Center area but the software on those was broken at the time I tried to use them. Also free internet, wired and wireless, in the rooms as part of the resort fee, which I, for some reason, did not have to pay -- perhaps because of the convention rate? Pool area was great, I tried both the wave pool (a big pool that generates waves like the ocean) and lazy river. Lots of lifeguards on duty, so if you are traveling with kids, that may be a plus."

    "content": "I would only recommend Mandalay Bay to those who want a beach experience. if the \"beach\" is not your thing then go elsewhere unless you get a great deal. This hotel is at best a 4 star hotel. Upon arrival at 2:30 we were told no rooms were ready just yet but was offered to down grade from our spa suite to a lower class room. We declined. We were given keys and was told we would be called on our cell phone when ready(we would also then be advises our room number. We were ok with that since check in was not until 3:00. We checked our bags with the bell cap and explored the hotel and casino. At 3:45 we were a bit irate that no call was yet received. We went to the registration desk and wad advised it was just finished. I inquired about the beach and was told it closed at 3:00 as they moved a concert time up 3 hours so their guests would be warmer. Hmm, so the nearly $1000.00 for 4 nights does not appear to matter much. We went to our room to see old decor, filthy windows affecting our views of the hills. I called to complain and said the room was not satisfactory. I was told they were all booked up and to check back tomorrow. Hmm again, I would expect them to call me tomorrow to advise what they could do. We never called back to complain, just decided not to waste our valuable time and really wanted to be as \"positive\". We then went to see Lion King, which is at the hotel's theater. My wife liked it, me not so much. Great outfits but too Disney for me and too long. Cast was good but not great. A personal preference I guess. Note we also saw \"love\" at the Mirage which was outstanding. No coffee in the rooms, which I missed, Starbucks got a lot of my money. You pay a daily resort fee which is supposed to pay for wifi and a daily US Today paper. I never got a paper or was told where to get it. A hard copy of a paper was not a big deal and so I didn't really care. However, interesting again that it was up to the customer to find out, not 5 star service. Wifi however was important as I wanted to read a lot on my iPad. It worked ok in the room but I was required numerous times to sign on and agree to their terms. It worked on the beach also. However restaurants and even the on site Starbucks did not work which was another bummer. The breakfast Buffet was ok if you just want a lot of food, volume over quality. The raffal cafe was much better. My wife got sick the night before we left and quite I'll the next morning. We called the desk and asked for a late checkout. We were granted an hour but warned if it was a minuet after noon then there would be a charge. Hmm yet again. Late check in for us was ok by them, close the beach early was ok but a minuet after noon and the dollar meter starts. I can actually understand this policy normally but.... We then go to the cab stand and got ignored by the bell caps. Two cabs waiting and nothing going on but a conversation betray the caps. Were they waiting for me to waive their tip money? After a minuet or so of being ignored (and with a sick wife) I went to the cab myself. After we got our bags in the trunk the bell cap came to the cab and scolded him for allowing us to get in the cab prior to the official loading area. The wife and I climbed in to the cab, I think the bell cap thought his uniform gave him special powers and authority. If I was reading this review I would suspect that the author is a difficult person. However it is really just the opposite. I do get upset when I am disrespected as a customer. I really liked the beach pool and I would consider staying again at Mandalay Bay but only for that reason. The spa in the spa suite was also a good thing. Management is the problem. If your not in to the beach pool then I would suggest you consider the \"Paris\" which as I recall does not have a \"resort\" fee. In my opinion the Paris is a 5 star hotel with a 5 star management. Overall we really had a great time, excellent shows and the weather was perfect - late October."

    "content": "My husband and I stayed at Mandalay Bay for 4 nights at the end of October. We chose Mandalay Bay because it was the host hotel for the UFC fight on Oct 29th. On the first night our flight arrival was quite late in the eve. This wasn't a problem at all with check-in as the lady at the front desk was very polite and friendly. My only concern was that I wanted a strip view but because we had a late check-in and all the rooms with a good view were taken, so we were stuck w a mountain view (not the best). Overall everthing went very smoothly. The rooms were standard and I found the beds to be very comfortable; however, we had a bit of down time and I would say that the tv channel slection needs improvement. I especially appreciated the complimentary tram that goes from Mandalay to Luxor to Excallibur (feet saver!). The pool is awsome - In my opinion it is the best in Vegas that I have experienced so far. The wave pool, although very beautiful, has only one wave come every minute or so. I think the sand has to be cleaned more often, I nearly stepped on a piece of glass from a broken beer bottle. I ended up utilizing the taxi services instead of renting a car - since we spent the majority of our time at the hotel, renting a car didn't seem as important. However, Mandalay has a rental car service on the main floor (quite convenient!). Maid service was very friendly and they did a good job with the room cleaning. My only complaint was that we wanted to sleep in one day and we had the \"do not disturb\" sign on the knob, but the maid barged in anyway. She appologized and left, it wasn't a big deal but I didn't appreciate the rude awakening. We ate at the buffet twice - not bad. Check out went smooth and the bell service was excellent! (Yes you can leave your bags with the bell service after check out incase you have a late flight back home). A word of advice, don't use the refridgerator for personal use and don't touch any of the fancy snacks inside or outside of the refridgerator - All of the items have sensors and once they have been moved or touched you will be charged for them at check out. We read a comment about this before we left & glad we did. You are also charged a daily resort fee (around $20/day)."

Had pre-requested room locations for our group which were unable to be accommodated (even though I called well ahead). Booked room with king sized bed, which they couldn't accommodate due to capacity. No offers of compensation for this overbooking. Room was nice although showed some wear & tear. Was surprised to find beds made without fitted sheets, just a tucked flat sheet instead. Sheets weren't stain free which concerned me & the carpet wasn't well vacuumed after the last guests. No extra blankets in room, nor we're there robes. Closets were big as was the dresser & washroom. There were lots of towels, never a threat to run out. One bonus was that the deluxe rooms with 2 queens are bigger than the ones with king beds. Make sure to get a strip view, especially if you are on a lower floor, otherwise you have a view of parking lot or roof top. Lots of dining options at Mandalay; Lupo was delicious & service was great. Really enjoyed the EyeCandy bar as well as Mix (which has amazing views & patio). The Foundation Room was alright, but the dance floor was barely existent & it felt small unless you had access to the 'members only' area. The best thing about Mandalay was the 'beach'/pool area. I would return to this resort purely because of the pool, you feel like you're in the Caribbean! It's a great place to relax after the many Vegas adventures. The worst things about Mandalay were the service, wifi reliability & the resort fees. Don't rely on their wake-up call service, chances are they won't get it right (as was our case causing us major headaches). The wifi was strong in the room, but once you left it crapped out & couldn't be found in the rest of the resort. Resort fees are bogus especially when they cover intermittent wifi. Also, don't touch the mini bar, it's sensored & they will charge you immediately! I would recommend only because of the beach."

It is modern, clean, has friendly staff and has some of the best restaurants I have ever ate at. Lupo's by Wolfgang Puck is right in the hotel and is excellent. We ate the breakfast buffet every morning, There was lots of selection and the food was terrific. There were other breakfast place options, but we just stuck with the buffet because it was only $16 and fast. On Saturday Sunday they have a brunch which is $27 and is still just as good but will more options. We stayed in a Spa Suite. It was a large room with an excellent view and very comfortable bed. If there was anything to say negative about this hotel, it would only be it's location. It is at the very end of the strip which can make for a long walk. However, the hotel has a tram that takes you as far as the Excalibur to help illivate this. We used the tram everyday. The pool area is fantastic and the spa was even better. I highly recommend staying at this hotel."

They were able to place us all on the same floor, either right next door or just a few doors down so that was great. The rooms were all clean and in great shape. We ate in 5 different restaurants while there. Bayside Buffet was nothing special and didn't have much selection for breakfast. Not worth the $50 for 2 people. Raffles Cafe has a great breakfast menu and everyone enjoyed the food. We also dined at The Mix Restaurant (in THEhotel - our waiter Scott from Philly was fantastic!), Strip Steak & Red, White & Blue and all were great. We attended UFC in the event centre and everything was well organized. Only complaint there was exiting after the event as it caused quite the congestion in the walkway in front of Starbucks & Strip Steak. Guests not involved in the event had to stand back and wait to get through as there was no way anyone was getting through against the flow. Elevator congestion has been brought up many times in other reviews but we never experienced more than a couple minute wait all weekend (and it was a busy weekend with UFC and the Pro Bull Riding events at the hotel). Was disappointed that the tram stops running around 10pm. In a town known for being up all night one would expect it to run a little later into the night. Mix Lounge (in THEhotel) was lots of fun and make sure you check out the washrooms - nothing like looking out the floor to ceiling window while using the toilet!). The pool area was fun. I now understand why you have to be \"behind the blue line\" before the waves come! Had lots of fun riding the waves in as well as floating down the lazy river. Had a great time and would stay here again."

The conference facilities, the THE Hotel, and the Four Seasons are all attached. Not on my \"Vegas on a Budget\" list, but if your company is picking up the tab, it is real step up from some of the other hotels in the area."

Room mediocre, albeit large for a vegas hotel. Although signs of age from peeling wallpaper to cracked electrical outlets. Also, tub dirty and took forever to drain. I found beds very uncomfortable. Housekeeping adequate, but skimpy on refilling shampoo/lotions. There are numerous restaurants in the hotel. Ate at Red,White,Blue (average) and Burger Bar (above average). The Eyecandy bar was pretty good. The pool area very large and nice, but kind of cool so didn't really use it. Also, for the $20 resort fee you get access to a pathetic \"cardio room\". Basically a large closet with 6 or 7 ellipticals/treadmills. It looked like something you would find in a Days Inn. Very weak. Like many places in vegas, prices just over the top, especially in the bars and the starbucks is like 2x a normal city starbucks. I didn't think they could do that...oh well. Be careful for the Foundation Room bait/switch. A guy in a suit approached us trying to lure us into going up for a drink. With a free admission and multiple 2 for 1 drink coupons he said it's great deal. Well, the place was near empty, which is always a little strange and the coupons only applied to domestic beer and house wine. He failed to mention that downstairs. Nice view and a great spot if it was busier. Overall, I would stay here if I could get a rate for $100-150, but that's it. You'd do better to stay at another place and save some $."

Only thing is the Minibar. Kids like to grab things. So warn them in advance. Saw the O show over at Bellagio that night. Girls were dragging after the show. Mandalay did a good job. Room was nice with great view of the pool. Will go back again in the summer next year."

Two closets and full lenght mirror was very nice. The pool area is awesome, have to have your key to get in. Mostly played in the lazy river, but really enjoyed the pool area each day. Lot's of eating and shopping options in the walkway/mall area, and used the tram each day to venture further up the strip. Requested a late check out and was given one free of charge(helped defray the resort fee some, but still hate the resort fees, I think the hotels should just up the daily rate, and be honest). Above average resort in Vegas, worth it if you get a deal, then keep in mind the daily resort fee. Would stay again."

The two closets were quite large and included a safe. From the far end of the strip the view of the entire valley as well as the panorama of the other resorts was breathtaking, especially at night.

    "content": "This hotel is overpriced and overrated. I was just there for the ADA convention and was leery of staying there because of the negative reviews ( long elevator waits, long check/in/out, dirty hallways, overpriced etc). When I phoned to book, the operator reassured me that she had NEVER seen elevator line ups and that the rooms were way above average. Because the convention was at the same property, I decided to stay there, even though the rooms were over $250/night. I travel frequently attending conventions and I want the readers to know that I only post reviews worthwhile in attempt to contribute to the next persons decision- not to bolster or berate a hotel out of a personal vendetta. Firstly, if you are a person that can afford to spend 250/night, this is NOT the place for you. I think the average income person saving up for a beautiful room would also be greatly disappointed. The rooms are AVERAGE. The furniture is worn and out of date. The beds are HORRIBLE. They reek of CHEAP and I was constantly fighting rolling off the sides as they were so worn out ( high in the middle with weak outer sides). I am a linen freak- so the sheets were average, the towels POOR, the bed coverings old and stale. I would not want to lay on top of the bedspreads with any body parts exposed....the impression of unclean/unwashed bedspreads rings loud and clear. NO fresh smelling anything. The towels looked recycled even though I threw them on the floor for laundry pick up. They were wrinkly, not fresh smelling and showed some stains as well. The bathrooms are ok, big and clean. Did not like the cramped toilet room which was separate from the vanity/shower/bathtub room. I kept knocking the phone off the hook every time I turned around.It was mounted on the wall right next to the toilet seat. The plumbing made constant noise throughout the night. There were dirty food trays left outside in the halls for an entire day. Room service was EXCEPTIONALLY POOR. I timed my wait for someone to pick up the phone, it was 13 minutes. Furious, I demanded explanation; they rudely replied were very busy and that on top of my phone wait, there would be another SIXTY MINUTE wait for food delivery. SO that night I phoned room service at 11pm thinking I could order my breakfast early and no have to go through that again. They told me the earliest I could expect my breakfast was 8 am as all earlier time slots were filled!! RIDICULOUS SERVICE. Honestly, I've had better service at the Holiday Inn and Best Western. We tried the Raffles restaurant at 1030pm when we arrived, because all other restaurants close at 10pm. People always arrive late in Vegas, why aren't restaurants open to cater to that huge population?? Raffles was TERRIBLE. Extremely PLAIN food, slightly lower caliber than White Spot which has a much better menu to select from. . Its location is at the very south end of the strip so everyone needs a cab. The cab line ups were 40-60 people deep every night I was there. So if you make reservations somewhere , you better plan an additional 20 minute line up for a cab. The elevators had lineups as well. people waited for 15 minutes for an elevator. Finally, a concierge guy led us to their SERVICE elevators and I continued to use those throughout my stay as I refused to wait so long and be so cramped inside an elevator. Perhaps the lineups were extra long because of the convention being held on their property and it was tightly booked. But the hotel should be prepared to meet the demands of a fully booked situation, yet it failed TERRIBLY. Checkout was slow again because the front desk was understaffed for the amount of guests. SLOW service, bad food, mediocre rooms. NEVER again at the Mandalay bay, even at a reduced special rate, would I ever stay there. This hotel does not live up to its purported reputation and was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I should have gone with my initial gut feeling for the Aria or Vdara. Clean, nonsmoking and brand new hotels with better prices and nicer restaurants."

This is by far one of the cleanest and best smelling casinos on the strip. The pool area is great and consistently rated as one of the best in Vegas, However leave the kids at home. Vegas is no place for children and every time I see them neither the kids or parents look happy. The elevators to the higher floors are express, but still take a while due to the crowds of people trying to come and go. I like that this hotel is the last one headed south on the strip because it cuts down on some of the cut through foot traffic. Some of the hotels on the middle of the strip are completely jammed full of crowds walking through all day and all night."

Usually comped or very inexpensive due to status, but I've checked out regular rates as well and seems very fair. $20 resort fee is standard for all MGM/Mirage hotels. My other choice in this family is the Mirage, but I prefer Mandalay's pools. Nice beds here, and nice large bathrooms with separate tub and shower, dual sinks, separate toilets as well. Strip views are excellent with the right rooms as it looks straight down LV blvd. Next to the airport so you might hear a little bit of plane noise if you're sensitive. If I had some complaints is that the place is too big. Takes a while to walk from self parking to the rooms. Even valet isn't right next to the elevators. Although the square-ish layout makes it not as annoyingly large as something like MGM or Aria. Also needs more restrooms in the casino. I also like this part of the strip because it's easier to get in and out. Russell or Tropicana avenue has easy access to the 15, and Mandalay is also right next to the airport."

There were a few little things that werent working, but nothing major, and nothing that affected our stay. The alarm clock did not work,one of the bathroom potlights was out and the clicker for the tv died after 6 or 7 minutes of use...again nothing major, just a little annoying. The pool was awesome, a little cool..but thats ok. The lazy river was fun, the sand great. I guess my only complaint would be the amount of people smoking...by the pool area and evrywhere else. I have been to Vegas before and I know I should expect that people are smoking, but the intensity of it is overwhelming! We would definately go back and stay there again!"

We'll I guess that was 5/6 years ago when everything was new and modern. This hotel needs a serious renovation, the rooms are horrible, the curtains and the bed spreads are at least 5 years old. The furniture in the room is scratch and in BAD condition. I stood in line for an hour to check-in on a Sunday night, it was the worst Vegas experience. The hotel is directly across from the airport and on the far end of the strip so the views are not that great depending on which tower your in. The meeting space had a FOUL odor which smelled like raw sewage. Disgusting. Housekeeping did not thoroughly clean the bath tub, so I never used it, but the bathroom was huge. The rooms are not even suites, just regular hotel rooms. Room Service food was below average. There are so many great options for Vegas, The Wynn, The Venetian, The Bellagio all better locations and updated rooms. I've heard the Como is fabulous and brand spanking new. As soon as I checked in to the Mandalay, I was ready to go home. It was a long 5 days. The best part of the trip was the House of Blues, awesome!"

Room....was very nice (6th floor 219) and we had a great view of Vegas lights. Bed pretty comfortable, nice roomy bathroom. Room service breakfast was very good and hot and the room service delivery person was extremely helpful and and friendly and gave us lots of good Vegas tips. There was live music in one of the bars featuring two different bands (one played 70's rock, the other played a mix of 80's/90's rock. Had fun dancing and people watching. Won $50 on the penny slots but didn't win playing any other game (roulette or poker). Pool and beach was really nice however I stepped down into the beach area with my flip-flops on and it was so slippery I fell and twisted my knee! Beware and just know that the surface in the beach pool is very SLIPPERY!!!! Overall I would go back if I could get a good price on a room. Nice that there wasn't as much walking within the hotel (as in the MGM where you have to walk miles to get from the casino to your room)."

Check-in and Check-out are not very efficient - I tried the express check-out on the TV but the system was not functioning and ended up having to wait about 20 minutes to check-out in the lobby. The bed area was ok - the bed was a little bit uncomfortable. No fridge, microwave, etc. but I didn't really expect those at a resort hotel. The bathroom area was very spacious which was great because there was plenty of space to keep your luggage and other items such as purses, etc. I did not try out the jacuzzi bathtub but the shower was nice. I liked that the toilet was separated from the shower/bath/sink area into a small room with a door - this was definitely be nice if I had been traveling with someone else. The elevators tended to be quite slow - I heard many complaints from other people at the conference about the wait times. The restaurant choices were good - although pricey - I only ate at the Red, White, and Blue Cafe (quite good), Bayside Buffet (stay away), and Raffles Cafe (pretty good). Very limited casual dining options - for lunch, we headed over to the food court at Excalibur. Conference space is a loooong distance from the rooms so make sure to bring your walking shoes. The location of the resort is also somewhat limiting being so far at the end of the strip - again, if you want to enjoy all the sites/sounds of Vegas, you might be better off staying somewhere more central. I would probably stay here again if I was planning a relaxing poolside vacation in Vegas."

They did give us a $ 50 credit when we checked in at 4;35 pm since our sky view suite 60316 was not ready.

Was fixed by the time we returned at night.Had read in previous reviews about the mini bar charge. We bought water from local CVS and called down to front to see if we could put a few bottles in. They said as long as you don't touch or move any items. Was unable to accomplish this. On top of the dresser were snacks and a few boxes. One was labeled the Love Box. My friend picked it up to read the contents. We got a hardy laugh as we were friends on a girls weekend. Anyhow, when we went to check out we were charged $38. Didn't know what it was and called down. Were asked if we used the Love Box. We laughed that we had picked it up to read. Apparently all items are magnetized, so it registers immediately if you touch an item. The desk took off the charge. Glad I wasn't there with my kids as they would have touched or rearranged the items. Beware as there wasn't any notification of this. Ate at breakfast buffet one day which was great - many choices and the omelettes were scrumptous. Arrived 10 minutes before breakfast eneded so we got to eat both breakfast and lunch for the breakfast price. Starbucks coffee nearby too. also at at Raffles and Lupo, both very good as well. Spent a day at The Spa--fabulous. Plan to arrive really early or stay after your treatment. Very calming and relaxing environment. Super clean and very attentive to details. They provide fruit and drinks as well. Only big downside to hotel is location. Last hotel on strip. Took cabs everywhere as the shuttle isn't worth it..too far from strip and you waste so much time going through hotels to get everywhere."

The Mandalay bay is no different, in trying to create that \"mystical tropical feeling\". It works to some degree with their nice pools, but the arid desert around the property ultimately just kills illusion. And this hotel will keep you in shape, without having to go the gym. It is so far south that if you walk to it you might as well imagine yourself walking until you end up in Mexico. It is at the very south end of the strip. Oh, and beware the sneakly $22+/day \"resort charge\" that is included in any of the online prices, but they will stick you with it."

Not sound proof as the doors are just louvered doors but they look nice. We were only on the 5th floor so not much of a view but that was ok. Our check in was quick but check out was 30 min so be prepared. There is a lock on the mini bar and be sure to use it or you will be charged for things you did not drink. Luckily they took our charges off. The staff was friendly enough, the restaurant choices are ok. I found the breakfast buffet better at Luxor than the MB. The pool area is the best! Finding a chair was easy however shade is very hard to come by. The wave pool was very fun as was the lazy river. Either bring your own tube or be prepared to spend big bucks for a tube. We just went with the flow without a tube and I think was more fun. I also did visit the Shark Reef. You could probably save your money as it is not really that special. The MB is at the far southern end so if the \"Strip\" is where you want to be you must be prepared for walking. The mono rail is the best way to get around on the strip but you have to make your way to MGM to get on. Although it is a great place I would only go there if you do not have interest in seeing what the strip has to offer as it is so far away or be prepared to walk or spend money on a taxi."

We ordered breakfast the night before and gave them a specific time for the delivery (in a half hour window). All three times the food was late, cold and the order was wrong. We complained to the manager who just didn't get it and did not seem to care! She even yelled at us for being \"unreasonable\"! Very disappointing! We had to ask the maid on our 4th day if she could change the sheets! It was a war requesting extra towels or soap! New shampoo bottles left every other day even though the bottle in the room was near empty. Body wash? Forget it. Not even offered. Nickel and diming us everyday for stuff that used to be free and prevelant. You have to put money in a machine ($5 minimum) to use the computers in the business center even if you just want to print a boarding pass! $15 daily \"resort fee\" added to our bill for services that we did not even use!

(Get your shady seats early in the morning for later in the day)The Shark Reef was a fantastic aquarium, definately worth a visit. Great room, restaurants and a fantastic pool. We barely left the hotel because it had everything we needed to keep a child and adult entertained. Fleur (restaurant) had Foie Gras on the menu,prepared perfectly and hard to find in any city! The Hotel restaurants had many happy hour deals that helped keep expenses down and all with excellent service. \"Red, White and Blue restaurant\" had $5 Bloody Mary's all day which we picked up on the way to the pool (and kept going back for) We will make this our Vegas Home. The only thing I wished it had was coffee maker in your room."

But there is so much to do on the resort, and in particular the pool or \"beach\" more than makes up for slightly less desirable location. The beach was amazing! so much better than regular pools of other hotels. This beach consists of multiple pools, AND lazy river AND huge wave pool that was fun for adults and kids alike. Was kid friendly, but the place did not feel overrun by kids."

The staff were lovely and didnt wait too long and helped out whenever we needed anything, and the lifts were quick. The conference area was impressive, but the shark aquriam was a let down, it was pricey for what you see, and it takes less than 30 minutes. The music at the weekend was class in the hotel but the bar beside the casino was too pricey. The swimming pool was fantastic and spent quality time their and the lazy pool was relaxing, plenty of lifeguards on duty. The Bar at the top of the hotel was brilliant with great views of the strip and would defo recommend going up their, Only problem really was its at the far end of the strip would buy good shoes, it's a walk!"

Be prepared to walk for lots of things you want to do. I did not have to deal with the check-in process since I was not the one that made the reservation, so I can not speak to the courtesy or rudeness of the check-in service personnel. The rooms were fairly standard and do not really stand out as over luxurious. The bathrooms are nicely done with a nice tiled shower and a deep sunken garden tub. The resorts and pool areas were really nice. There is a nice wave pool, and there are some private pool areas that could be enjoyed by couples looking for a little romance or for families looking for a good vacation place. There is good value here at the Mandalay Bay."

Then upon checkout, I was charged for items from the mini-bar which were removed by the mini-bar staff (we were having 40 people in the suite and my mom requested it be removed before people came so no one ate any of it). Apparently they didn't communicate that they had removed it. When I explained the situation at checkout, the woman accused me of lying and called someone to talk to them about it...except she spoke SPANISH and I couldn't understand what she was saying. For being at the FAR end of the strip, you'd think they would go out of their way to be accommodating and friendly...Apparently not. I'd rather save my money and stay in the middle of the strip - go with Bill's for Flamingo."

If you've never stayed here this hotel is at the far end of the strip, and takes a little bit to get to the rest of the strip. The hotel does have quite a bit of food options, but they all tend to be nicer type places. If you want fast, cheap food, there is none here. There is a small food court in the convention area. I do not recommend eating there no matter how hungry you are. Ate at the fast chinese food and it was one of the grossest places I have ever eaten. Ri-Ra Irish pub in the corridor is an excellent restaurant. Do I recommend this hotel, Yes, especially for the strip, it is one my favorite."

My tab ran me $70 for 3 sandwiches, but it was the wait that made me give them a bad review and I am not just talking about the lines either.My advice to first timers in Vegas is to rent a car if going with Family,explore the area outside of the strip making your trip more worthwhile. But overall the Mandalay have clean rooms,friendly staff and the best pool. For gamers, I recommend MGM,Bellagio or Caesars. Unless,you like it quiet."

The bathroom was amazing hot tub and steam shower, which were fantastic after an 11 hour flight. We chose to eat at the Mandalay Buffet, which is not the cheapest in Vegas but yet again well worth the money, the choice is mind blowing for which ever sitting you choose. The one and only criticism we could find, was when we were using the elevators on our way down to the mandalay beach pool, ( which is great ) there was a big conference on during our stay, dressed in a sarong and swimming shorts, we ended up in the elevator with people in suits, and this did feel a little off putting, and not very holidayish.

    "content": "We travelled to Las Vegas from LA for a 6 night stay at The Mandalay Bay. We chose the hotel at short notice and were looking for a good pool. The hotel is one of the closest to the airport costing only about $18 and taking not much longer than 10 mins. We checked in with no big problems, having arrived before the check in time and were given a 'pool view' room which wasnt an upgrade but was on the 12th floor and had a good view of the pool complex. The Hotel has the 'wow factor' in terms of decor, pools etc which is great but you certainly pay for it. we were given no upgrades and having spent over $2500 in hotel we were given $11 back in comp points on our members cards. We never had any of the elevator issues spoken about in other reviews, there was a constant stream of different convention attendees which made it busy at breakfast and dinner times but quieter during the day. The breakfast buffet was good, it cost $15 each and never changed but the service was quick and the staff pleasant enough. There are cheaper places to eat but not cheap enough to overcome the convenience of eating in the hotel before going out. For evening meals its around $30 and you would have to go off strip to find a better deal or eat in one of the cafes like JJs in the Paris. The pools at Mandalay are great however I didnt realise that some of the pools you see in pictures actually belong to The Four Seasons and are locked off from Mandalay patrons. Also to note is that during the hot part of the days, shade is hard to come by unless you are prepared to keep moving beds under the shade of bushes & trees or willing to pay the $100 or a day for a couple of beds & umbrellas. The rings for the lazy river are 'buy only' so be ready to carry them to and from your room each day then youll be walking round. There are plenty of free beds around the pool which are quite tightly packed when its busy The hotel is well served by the monorail which runs from the Mandalay, through the Luxor and stops at the Excalibur. Depending how far you are wanting to travel its another half hour walk along the strip to the Venetion, maybe 20 mins to the Ballagio. There is a bus along the Strip which runs every 20 mins and costs $5 each for 2 hours or $7 for 24hrs use. Its a good service but stops every couple of hundred meters and so takes a long time when busy We watched the Viva Elvis show at the Aria, The Chris Angel magic show at Luxor & the Jersey Boys at Palazzo and would reccommend all of them. I would get tickets on line before going in future as there are deals which are not available when you get there, The 'tickets4tonight' stalls offer a discount but they are limited to the next 24 hours and are generally the seats that no one else wants. The other thing about Strip hotels is the resort tax which is a hot topic over there but at the Mandaly costs you another $20 /room a night for not a lot, when other hotels off strip offer similar facilities at no additional charge. We enjoyed the Mandalay, certainly better than the Luxor or Excalibur and 100% better than the New York New York which is very tired. On another vist I would go somewhere closer to the centre of the strip but maybe off it. I almost booked The Platinum having read the reviews but time constraints meant I had to make a decision and the Mandaly pools swung it, however the family feel of the Platinum, the friendly Manager and the value for money (despite the smaller pool and dodgey walk from the strip) would swing it for me on another day."

We had a reservation for a 2 night stay in a deluxe 2 queen bed room at Thehotel at a nightly rate of more than $340+ a night. The room type was not available and Julie told us THEhotel was oversold by 2%. I think that the high rate we were paying we should have been given a complimentary upgrade or been more accommodating but instead she downgraded us in order for us to get a 2 queen bed room. There is also a resort fee of $20.00 per night which we paid for in cash. We were tired, anxious and had dinner reservations and were pressed for time so we just rolled with the punches. Finally after the 35 minute ordeal we take the elevator up and get to our room with a \u201crecuperating\u201d sign hanging on the door. We all know what that means but we still attempted to access the room and to our (in a sarcastic voice) shocking surprise the door to our room did not open BIG SHOCKER. We had someone from the housekeeping department verify and check the room was someone in the room ~ shocking. The housekeeper apologized and sent us back down. Once again we had to wait in line for longer than 20 minutes. Here is the problem if they know they are sold-out why do they only have 6 front desk agents with more than 15 empty stations? They were low on staff on a night where they clearly know they have a lot of arrivals checking in\u2026 it\u2019s a no brainer more staff for more arrivals. When we came back down Julie was at lunch ~ which must have been the reason why she rushed to get rid of us without even directing us to the elevator or telling us more about the hotels facilities or amenities. Dustin was more accommodating and apologetic. He offered us 1 night comp stay but because our reservation was made thru hotwire there is too many hoops/ tape in order for us to get a refund. Instead he gave us a $200.00 food and beverage credit that we would be able to use in select hotels along with 4 passes to the spa. He also offered to comp our resort fee of $44.50 which he had a hard time trying to locate where the money went. Luckily enough we had our receipt which indicated that we had paid for it. On our departure date we called to verify that our food charges were being posted and that we did have a food and beverage credit. Jessica the PBX operator was clueless and even argued with us about not having paid for the resort fee when we even told her we had a receipt. Finally we straightened that out and came downstairs to inquire about our shuttle. We walked over to the concierge desk and the young gentleman which was there was kind enough to call and arrange our shuttle, unfortunately the shuttle never came and when we called the company they said a call was never placed so we had to pay for a taxi. I will never stay at the Mandalay Bay"

    "content": "The Mandalay Bay was a good choice of hotel for the conference , this is a huge conference centre. Holding many conferences at any one time. The delegates were generally not impressed with the conference food. I had a boxed lunch of a caesar salad and it was literally frozen solid. All the Vegas hotels are competitively priced for rooms you would never get this standard in London or many other places for the same price. I thought this was a lovely hotel , without the 'disneyesque' themed dramatic decor of some of the other OTT Vegas venues. Rather it had subtler , yet still grand style , of mainly marble and crystal , much more soothing to the brain than the others. It is located at the end of the strip , is the last hotel and in a quieter location with a great view of the airport/mountains + strip + sunrise and sunset. I liked it for this reason and the soundproofing was excellent. The airport is not as bad as it sounds , the love level buildings give way to views of the ring of mountains around the Nevada valley. We could see the full length of the strip with the airport and mountains to the left , the best of both worlds. You could navigate the vast areas of the resort without fighting your way through crowds of strip crawling tourists. The Bellagio for example was a nightmare for this. There is a sky train that takes you from here to the middle(ish) of the strip (Excalibur) if you want to sight see, anything Between the Mandaly bay and the dreadful Excalibur on the strip is not worth investigating anyway. Check-in-desk queues were many and long (15-20 mins in our case). Bell desk and concierge services were superb. Front desk patchy. Tour desk non-existent. Theatre and shows desk very good. Wifi was free (probably because we were conference delegates but that was a bit patchy) Our room number was in the 2000's , Though big and bright the corridors smelled so bad , very stale but looked very clean. Our room was huge , had fabulous views of 'The Strip\" , double sink bathroom , double sinks , separate toilet , bath and shower. I was tickled and enjoyed their replica beach. Once you were relaxing on the crowded sand near the wave pool , with a cocktail under the palms you could almost imagine you were on a beach. Regardless of the crowded (hotel residents only beach) it was a nice outdoor space in the hot Vegas sun to put on cooling beach ware and just chill for an hour. The Madaly is home of the Lion King show but they handle the theatre going crowds very well in the conference section. The only real complaint I have is their laundry service. There clean towels had a strange stale offensive musty smell, which made me feel a bit sick. They were off colour and did not look very clean. Not the case for bedding which was lovely. The laundry service was relatively reasonable and we had to take advantage of it. What a false economy , I had to throw away most of my white underwear , which came back grey and not really looking or smelling like newly laundered clothes. We had similar problems in Australia. Price wise , you get stung for everything else when you want to eat or drink in Vegas Hotels. The Madalay Bay was no exception. A cocktail that would cost say $5 to $8 in LA can be anything from $14 + here. Water $4 a bottle. Food in the various chain restaurants in the resort is mediocre and not a fair price. in the Resor we ate at Red White & Blue, aggressive tip fishing service , and bizarre interpretations of eggs benedict and other well defined dishes. Only edible if you are hungry. Lupo's and Raffles Cafe were similarly underwhelming. The shops in the complex selling basic essentials are expensive too...you just have to suck it up , you are in Vegas after-all. I mention this because nobody told us about the truth of the inflated prices. Take plenty of petty cash , most service staff in all hotels is tip orientated and you end up feeling like a cash cow..... attention to order taking is minimal , however , you will find you have a new best friend in most waiters or waitresses. There are some wonderful exceptions Excursions . Do go out of Vegas and see the Nevada desert and the old Howard Hughes Ranch , the Red Rock Mountains and the general area. The Hoover Dam was worth a visit. But the inside tour at the dam was short and a bit rushed , the commentary by our , obviously tired of his jib guide, was so fast and garbled that it was pointless, nothing was coherent especially in the large groups you are bundled into when you get there. However !!!!! just being there is worth the trip and quite humbling. The flight to the Grand Canyon is a must! Breathtakingly beautiful. A vast and powerful expanse of nature that puts life into perspective. We also saw a Cirque Du Soleil 'O' . One of the water shows. WOW!!!! a magnificent show I would watch again. A strip tip If you want to escape the quite of the Mandalay and Luxor end of the strip , take the sky train to Excalibur. At the MGM / Excalibur area of the strip , things get a bit messy and ugly, not for children really, it is a little confrontational with all the sex-touting concentrated here. It is a bit closed in too. Get of here and just walk straight down towards the Bellagio end of town where all the old classics begin. Vegas is pure escapism on a grand scale, Disney for adults! I would not rush to return to the strip but I would love to spend more time in the desert and at the lakes. Winter or summer , It has a beauty of its own."

Mandatory $22/night fee for the 'free' wi-fi service and paper (that you have to go down to the store and pick-up) which they will NOT waive even if you don't want the 'services'; btw, the wi-fi was only intermittently available, not reliable what-so-ever. No doorman - I remember when a four-star meant no problem getting through the front doors with your luggage. Room: Desk lamp burned out. Iron didn't work, took 20 min to get a replacement. No mouthwash, not a q-tip or tiny finger nail file to be found. Bed was sheeted incorrectly, setup so you had to sleep against the comforter, yuck. No fan in the bathroom. No difference in the a/c system from low to high fan settings. TV menu and service slow/confusing. Phone system was dead/unavailable for hours during the night so couldn't call for wake-up call, room service, etc - glad there wasn't an emergency! Ordered a pot of coffee and was told it would be 45 minutes - for a pot of coffee? No coffee in-room, long walk to get your own in the morning, and expensive, of course. Conference: was a LONG walk from the hotel. No stopping by your room during breaks because you're looking at least 20 minutes round trip at a good clip. The only good service I received was from the wait staff during conference meals - must say, they did a quality job. Check-out: Tried to use the in-room check-out service. But, after going through all the screens, yep - the service was unavailable. So, now add another 30-60 minutes to go to the far-away under-staffed check-out counter since their four-star services don't work. Definitely not worth the hassle and pretend-quality."

Large tub, but no jets, double sinks and private toilet with phone nearby. Bed was comfortable and TV was large. But at the far in of the strip. Had breakfast at the buffet. Was a good meal, but then it is really hard to mess up breakfast. Went to the pool area. Be warned you have to buy or rent tubes for the lazy river. The wave pool is a joke. You get 1 wave every 60 seconds. Hot tubs are the best part. Pool water was on the cool side."

The only reason I stayed at MB was because a friend had a free stay so we decided to join him and stay in the same hotel, bad mistake. The hotel is old, the service is not good, and the supposed amazing pool area is awful. It is overcrowded, dirty, and the beach is a joke. I have been to Vegas 6 times, staying in a new place each time, and I can clearly say that the MB is the worst out all 6. I would even say that for the value the Tropicana and Rivera blow MB away. One of the most startling things was that we checked in, which by the way took at least an hour, it was actually worse checking in at the hotel, then the airport. Anyways, we went to our room which I thought was dated, we unpacked went to the pool, when we came back a few hours later, I noticed that there was now a half eaten cheesecake factory cheesecake below the TV, which was not there when we left. Neither my wife or I could figure out how it got there. To make a long story short the hotel credited us $50 for the problem which they could not explain. Please skip this hotel, I could go on and on, but this hotel does not deserve anymore of my time."

The Good: Far south end of the Vegas Strip so there was not as much vehicle/pedestrian traffic. Casino was not too crowded and plenty of places to eat at the resort. The Bad: NO way is this a 5 star resort. No one helps you with your luggage when you arrive. You are forced to stand in line at the check-in counter for 30-45 minutes with less than half of the check-in counters in operation. The room that we booked (King bed, non-smoking) was not available so we were forced to take a two-queen bed for the first night. The first room we stayed in smelled of smoke, had cigarette burns on both comforters, had dirty/oily windows that obscured the view of the city and had a pile of dirty towels stacked in the hallway outside our room. The second room (Our original reservation request) that we got the second day was also not clean and had several non functional items in the room including the a/c, hot water faucet, bathroom door and a swing-out mirror in the bathroom. To top out the trip we had to wait in line over 30 minutes to check out and they overcharged us for a meal that we had eaten in one of the restaurants. Maybe we expected too much from this hotel, but this location is in bad need of some TLC. I would certainly recommend that you check the TA reviews at other Vegas hotels before staying at Mandalay."

However it had a fun wave pool, a lazy river pool ( on a Friday too crowded that you kept bumping into people (many of them were drunk) not a great environment with kids. And a couple other regular pools but one was closed off one of the days. No slides. There was loud rap music playing. Not a relaxing atmosphere. Definitely more for the party minded group.

It is connected with the main Mandalay Bay Hotel. The Hotel is newer and away from all the hustle and bustle of the casino and lounges and restaurants. Our room was immaculate and very well appointed. The soaking tub was to die for. We liked everything about this place except it is so huge that you have to walk a lot to get from one end to the other. There are lots of restaurants, pools, shops. The only con I have about any of these Vegas Hotels on the strip is the price of food. Very expensive to eat at any of them. $40 for breakfast is a little steep for 2 people. All in all, I would recommend this Hotel if you can find a good deal. Everyone we associated with were real nice and friendly, our room was always cleaned. My husband used the fitness center a few times and he loved it. Our bed was very comfortable. It was very quiet at night, couldn't hear any noise from anywhere. One day we rode the bus that goes up and down the Strip. It costs $7 for a 24hour pass. They make lots and lots of stops, so you can go to any place you want all day long. It even took us to the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop since it is a big tourist attraction now. You know, Pawn Stars from the History Channel."

I checked in late so the line was very short. Comfortable casino, upscale but not snobby. Not too touristy like Bellagio or Wynn with people taking pictures everywhere. For families on a budget, you can eat cheap if you walk the inner walkway toward the Luxor. Lots of options! Pool is great especially if you like wave pools but in my opinion, the Hard Rock pool is still the best by far!!"

    "content": "I recently stayed at Mandalay Bay in August 2011 with four 10 year olds and another Mom. This was a Moms and kids three day get-a-way before school was back in. The check-in wait time was over an hour with long lines of famlies. We were checking in on a Monday at 3:00pm and our 2 rooms were not ready until after 5:00. They did not call me to tell me they were ready until 2 days later (I started laughing)....I called them at 5:00pm the day we checked in and said we had waited long enough. One room was ready. It was hard to complain since the other Mom was able to get a deal via her smart phone for $60 per night per room, we had 2 rooms over looking the pool. The standard rooms are what I might describe as a upscale but are in need of a remodel due to age/wear and tear. With a large bathroom (large tub and seperate shower) and comfee bed the room was about 500 sq feet. Two large closets seemed overkill so the room seemed smaller filled with a angled desk and a one person fainting couch. One of our rooms with a king bed had a large window into the bathroom as soon as you walked into the room. The bathroom is a place no one wants to be seen so this was odd. The double doors to the bathroom were double louvered french doors which provide no noise privacy, just awkward. Like all Las Vegas strip hotels there was a $25 daily resort fee and a fridge you could not use. Valet parking was free and was often full but if you tell them you are a hotel guest it becomes available. I may sound like a complainer but for the price we got a great deal. The deal we did not get was the cabana for the pool, $375+ plus food, drinks and tip make for an expensive pool day. I called 7 weeks in advance and the cabanas were almost sold out.The cabana was nice but little shade and the fridge with waters/sodas was cool at best. The pool is crazy with families, long lines for bar and restrooms. I do not like crowds so this placed made me nuts. Also, only a few of the smaller pools allowed small kids under 48 inches so little kids were everywhere running around. Our kids were tall enough to go into the wave pool and lazy river....both packed. The fake sand on the \"beach\" was enough to burn the bottoms of the kids feet. Luckily we had flip flops. The family friendly hotel restaurants did not exist. When the elevators are packed all day with little kids, floaty toys and brought in fast food you would think the hotel would gear themselves towards their clients: FAMILIES. The almost family friendly restaurant, House of Blues, waited 30 minutes, and were able to get something for every ones picky appetites, vegetarian, etc. The food was decent but LOUD interior. Across the street but a very long walk were a few fast food options. The hotel is a dream to gamble at. No one is gambling so very little smoke and all machines/tables are open. The entire 3 days the casino was empty. I have never seen this at a on the strip hotel.......although the location of Mandalay is very far South and not walking distance to many other casinos. Would I stay here again? Yes when traveling with several kids on a tight budget. I would not stay here for a romantic getaway with my husband...not in my lifetime."

Was looking forward to checking out the Mandalay Bay because I've heard alot of good things about it over the years. We also got a good deal from Expedia, especially given it was a Friday night. The pluses - the beach/wave pool is definitely the main selling point to staying at this hotel. Definitely unique, and my 2 year old loved it, even though he had to be in the area to the left because of his (small) size and the size of the waves. We couldnt pry him away from the water. You still get some short waves going to that side, but the water is so shallow, it's totally fine for children. Unfortunately, there was a concert that night, and because of setup time, they had to close the beach/wave pool early at 5 pm. Another plus is the fact that the elevators are actually near the lobby and you don't have to travel through the windy, smoky casino to get to the guest elevators, especially when towing your suitcases. All staff we encountered were friendly and efficient. The valet was quick to drop-off and quick to pick-up even on a Friday night with a concert going. The front desk and other staff were also helpful throughout our stay. The other attractions were nice too - the aquarium was definitely fun for children, and the casino was spacious and well laid out. The minuses - The biggest one is the room - it's a decent sized room but it's showing its wear and tear. The hotel hasn't been around for too long but it's aging unexpectedly. The color scheme of the rooms and hallways need to be upgraded too. Too dull. The bathroom is a good size with a shower stall and bath tub too. You can also hear alot of what is going on in the hallways - the walls/door were pretty thin. Next - it's great that the elevators are near the lobby, and thus near the strip, but there are only 2 elevator banks, and the lines for elevators are ones I have never seen, including in Vegas. The guests overall were also a little out of control from what we saw in the lobby and the elevators, but maybe because it was a Friday night. But we had a bunch of drunks yelling in the hallway at 9 pm \"lets go hookers\" and then trying to open the door to our room. They were so wasted that they didnt realize their room wasn't even near ours. Depending on the purpose of my trip - would probably look elsewhere to stay. But if I would bring my children again in the future, the beach/wave pool would be a nice attraction to want me to stay here again."

Peopel who had lost their key etc, also had to wait in this long line. The concierge or guest services could offer no help. Thr room was very nice. Bed was comfortable and was fairly sound proof. I liked the large newer bathtubs. I had a view of the airport. It is rather vanilla as another poster mentioned. The work out room is a joke.... the free one that is. If you want to pay a fee - $25 you can use the better one with machines and weights. Most Everyone we spoke with for assistance was either unprofessional or no help. The pool was clean and inviting. The waves felt like the real deal and was a relaxing environment. There were little shops and snack bars to get out of the sun and offered nice selections. If they train their staff better it would have been a fabulous stay."

We knew when we booked the Mandalay it was not in the core downtown area so it was no surprise that we did lots of walking. They have a free shuttle tram that we used to the excalibur that helped but is still alot of walking (we did not use the other tram at MGM). BEWARE this tram shuts down early on some nights! We had a room on the 29th floor with a nice view of the strip (need to wash the windows soon!) & were upgraded. The elevators seemed a bit slow at times even with as many as they have!The upgrade was appreciated however we did have to order a roll away since apparently none of these rooms have 2 beds. When we orderded the roll away they told us it would be 45 minutes and then when they came it was only sheets and no roll away? So we called again and they tried to charge us $35 a nite until we explained that it was suppose to be a room with 2 beds and they brought it fairly quickly this time. The rollaway was pretty comfortable and the bigger room with a jacuzzi tub great. The room was starting to look tired with a lack to details such as a curtain off the track the 1st night and missing light bulb etc. We were also disapointed that there was no coffee maker in the room or available through housekeeping. The pool or \"beach\" was the best part....get there early however if you want chairs! We enjoyed the sand and the WAVE pool - the water temprature was perfect! They have a VIP area for everything but it was very expensive. We never made it to the lazy river...the tubes were also very expensive. The biggest negative I had was the music...Not only was it pretty loud ( to be expected I guess) but we could hear 2 different songs blasting at the same time. REALLY? We had a room package that included a buffet every day & amazing deal/value...price for buffet seemed expensive otherwise. The buffet quality and variety was pretty good....they should however still try to change it up more? Lunch / Dinner seemed to be mostly the same foods. Servers we attentive and good. Weather was fabulous and we had a great trip!"

They are extremely happy to take your money, but don't ask for anything in return. I needed a maintenance man to open the safe in our room as an emergency (we had $800 worth of tickets for a show in our safe and couldn't open it). I put in a call to reception at 5.45pm and the maintenance man didn't turn up until just after 7pm. I went to reception to complain and found the staff there most unhelpful. I found this service to be diabolical to say the least. The show was at 7.30 and we just made it. The hotel is lovely, however, too far out, costs a fortune on taxis to get anywhere. Watch out for the taxi drivers, the hotel is 5 mins. away from the airport and on our day of departure we were charged $25 for a 5 min. ride."

Besides we get to walk around and exercise to get to the next casino. The food is average, there are better restaurants out there on the strip. The SPA is awesome... It's HUGE with plunge pool of cold and hot water. Love It!!! If you can score a good deal for the hotel room, then it's totally worth it...

The lines are CRAZY long to check in/out, but they did check me in when I arrived @ noon, 3 hrs earlier than check in. I was able to leave my bags and stay at the pool till my flight (after checkout) They give great customer service, but it will take you 20 mins to reach an operator on your room phone, Everything is new, shiney and beautiful! The views are AMAZING! Floor to ceiling tinted windows, private bathroom w/ spa tub and shower, dual sinks & private \"bathroom\" area. the bed was wonderful! So comfy and King size, my fav! There is a sitting area and desk, very spacious..I did receive 3 free buffet passes when I booked. The buffet was terrible! I went one day for lunch and another for breakfast. My husband asked how you can screw up eggs, but they did! you can skip it. Go to the Mirage's buffet if you want a great tasting/selection. The pool was nice, but there is security at the gate to make sure you go to the \"correct\" pool. The Four seasons is adjacent and they do have there own pool. Much nicer, but Mandalay guests cannot enter. Yes, there is a caste system here.The House of Blues didn't disappoint. Great concert! Great venue! And there is a crepe place adjacent to the HOB in the casino, Fabulous! I was craving those every night! Try the banana/strawberry w/ whipped cream.....Heaven"

I'd like to point out the positives, the hotel is immaculate in it's cleanliness and upkeep. You would think it was built yesterday. The check in process smooth, the rooms exquisite. The pool is beautiful and the selection of restaurants and cocktail bars is great. A couple \"nits\" That I feel were more than just preference issues but are lacking from the hotel in terms of expected guest comfort that one would expect from a luxury hotel. There is no coffee maker in the room. After a late night in Vegas it's a drag not to have a convenient coffee while getting dressed. The lighting in the rooms while ambient, and beautiful when wanting full light to pack/do make up etc was not there. They did not provide bathrobes for guests in the room either. They charge a resort fee that \"includes\" the fitness centre. What I found out that to mean was cardio only. To use the actual gym (which also had the better cardio equipment) was another 25$ per day on top of the resort fee!!! Ouch! The picture on the website would lead one to believe that the gym IS the fitness centre. I just thought that is an important distinction for those to whom working out is important. None of these nits are the end of the world but rather dissappoinments. The reasons however why I would not go back are as I said more to do with personal preference. Mainly they are way too far away from the centre action of the strip, and the gym itself and cardio equipment are merely \"OK\". As I train daily i do need a better gym. We have stayed at the Venetian in the past and that is where we would return. The quality of the hotel is on par with Mandalay, but the location is better, and they have a proper gym and heavy weight room and top of the line cardio equipment and many of each machine including step mills. As far as the nits above -they also surpass-they provide robes,coffee,and the resort fee includes gym access. So as beautiful as it was Mandalay Bay is a no go."

We were on the 26th floor. Rooms: They were very nice and clean! We had a view of the pools & beach. Rooms were very spacious! Pools/Beach: The pools were nice and warm. There were always lots of chairs available. We would get there between 11-2 and always found chairs. There is a wave pool but it only has one wave at a time and don't know why? There would be a delay of a few minutes before the next wave would start. It was still lots of fun and very refreshing! The lazy river was great also. You can bring your own tubes. Vegas Shows: We went to see a few shows while we were there and we highly recommend the Terry Fator show at the Mirage. It was really good. He is amazing! We took the bus pass which is really the best way to get around in Vegas. It cost us $20 each for 3 days and you can go all the way to the Premium Outlets which is a must!

The tram was out of order but there were no signs until you actually got to the tram. As travellers, we are getting really tired of there being an additional charge for things.

I was on the 30th floor facing the airport, and saw the Area 51 \"Janet\" Airlines 737s fly off to their secret work destinations each morning. The only room complaint I had was occasional noise from two sources: (1) outside street noises (sirens, loud car/bike engines, airplanes, etc...), and (2) the hallway. There was an abnormally large gap (maybe 1\"-1.5\") at the base of my room door that reduced the effectiveness of muffling hallway talking and noise. I was abruptly awoken at 2:00-3:00 in the morning a couple of times when late night partiers came down the hall loudly talking and laughing back to their rooms. While the rooms were clean and well-kept, the carpeting in the hallways was quite dingy from heavy hallway foot traffic. Mandalay should consider replacing the carpeting soon. The conference center itself is typical of most large conference centers. Plenty of open space/large hallways when attendees are all out on break at the same time. Decent noise-reducing wall partitions in the conference center, and several clean restrooms. Finally, a couple of other mild warnings/inconveniences, and one major one (for me): (1) Registration during \"rush hour\" does take quite awhile. The last time I was at Mandalay two years ago, they used a standard serpentine/roped queuing system that worked okay as long as they were staffed appropriately. However, this year the registration area was wide open.. kinda like at the grocery store. You look at the number of people waiting in line for each registration desk, make a mental evaluation of the type of people in each line to guess where the \"problem registrations\" will occur, and make your best guess at which lane/line will be faster..... and you always guess wrong! LOL. (2) Watch out for \"elevator rush-hour\" as well. Even though they have EIGHT elevators that service only the upper floors, you still have to be prepared for long elevator waits and pass on already full elevators when one or more large conferences are occurring. (3) My biggest gripe is the constant and pervasive cigarette smoking. I know that all hotels and casinos in Las Vegas still allow smoking, and Mandalay Bay (like others) strategically place conference rooms, restaurants and any other destination in such a way that you have to pass through or along the edge of the smoke-filled casino to get from your room to your destination, but I really abhor cigarette smoke, and after a week there, my clothes and luggage now reek with the unpleasant stench of tobacco smoke. It sure would be a good statement for Mandalay Bay's owners (MGM) would be the first to offer a completely non-smoking casino, much like how Marriott led the way with mainstream hotels. In spite of the awful cigarette smoke, my stay at the Mandalay Bay was pretty good overall."

    "content": "My husband and I have been to Mandalay Bay a number of times over our marriage. This time we decided to bring our daughter, age 10, and make it a trip beginning on the 4th of July and spanning the week... We expected that there would be quite a few people on the 4th but hopefully dying down through the week. That did not happen and honestly the way the hotel handled our situation was less than comforting. First of all, we arrived in our room to an unclean bathroom, one of the beds was terribly soft and turned out to be a bummer to sleep in. The pool area was so crowded you had to line up at least 1/2 hour prior to the pool opening in the morning for any chance of getting chairs. The beach bar and grill took almost 2 hours to get our lunch one day. The buffet was so crowded, the wait time to get in for lunch was over 1hour. What disappointed me the most was the management's handling of our stay. We brought the numerous issues to light and they didn't do anything. It was a simple sorry for your inconvenience. We were also told it was a good thing that we weren't in the other tower because they lost all electricity for 12hours. Apparently it could have been worse. I would have recommended Mandalay Bay prior to this stay because of the nice accomodations, the pool area is fantastic.. However, we won't be going back for quite some time. Beware, do not head to Vegas and stay at Mandalay Bay for any major holiday times, they simply can not handle it. By the way, Border Grill was terribly over-priced and the food was mediocre at best. Don't waste your money.. and, they don't even have a restroom in the restaurant you have to go down stairs and out and around etc. just to get to them!"

    "content": "My husband and decided to vacation in Las Vegas during the off season when its WAY TOO HOT (105 average/day) but VERY low hotel rates. We chose Mandalay Bay because of the room rate AND the wave pool/lazy river, knowing the water would help keep us cool. We were right about the wave pool and the lazy river! Didn't feel much of the heat when we were in the water, but at night it stayed around 90. The hotel was nice, but the check-in/check-out process was horrible. Due to the new computer system, they messed up our reservation (which we did online), wanted to move us to THEHotel, but I wanted our original Spa room with a view and 2 free all day passes at the buffet. After 45 minutes of back and forth about the buffet and room, we finally got our keys and went exploring. Because we checked in during lunch, they recommended that we choose a day where we could be able to use the passes \"all day\", so we decided to explore the first day. The pools are all you expect - except there weren't enough lounge chairs in the shade. You must pay extra for the nice chairs with umbrellas. We used the monorail to travel to other casinos, but when we tried to travel back to Mandalay Bay we discovered that the monorail closed at 10pm - no where did we see clear sign stating the monorail would close at 10pm! So we had to walk back through the concrete jungle with a heat index of 90 degrees! Overall, we rated the pool facilities the best asset to this hotel. The gambling was very tight, so we won nothing in the casinos. I made a theory while there: Off season = cheap rooms = tight slots. The food was not that good, but meals in other hotels were well worth it. Another mention: I did place my key too close to my phone while it traveled in my purse and the key got wiped clean (which they forewarn you at check-in) so it was my fault. But the re-key process was a nightmare, because it was 11:30pm and the check-in lines were long due to the new computer system and I tried to ask a clerk for a quick re-key but was told I had to wait behind everyone in the check-in line. Would be nice if they had a line just for registered guest! After 40 minutes to get re-keyed, it was after midnight when I got back to my room! The next day we checked out and it was another nightmare, since they had charged us for the buffet and we had to show them the 2 free all day passes in the room rate. Highly recommend that you print all online agreements during the online registration. The 2 free all day buffets were not printed on the confirmation form, so luckily we had printed the original registration form. The clerk removed the extra charge and we made it out of Las Vegas with a smaller debt. When we got home I discovered another \"secret\" charge on my credit card. They had replaced the buffet charge without any notification or reason. My American Express allowed me to dispute and call the Accounts Receivable number. The office said there was a limit on the amount for a free buffet. I argued that no where on the fine print did it say a maximum charge on the \"2 free all day buffet\" passes! There is a max charge on a single rate buffet price????? In the end, they did remove the charge, but not without a disagreement. Would I go back to Mandalay Bay? Yes, just for the pool! But certainly no buffets!"

    "content": "My son turned 21 and I was able to take him and 2 of his college buddies to Las Vegas to celebrate the event. I set one room up at Mandalay Bay and got a suite at The Hotel. Both rooms were spotlessly clean and decorated upscale. The bathrooms in each were large, updated, and again, spotless. It was perhaps a 3 minute walk between towers, but with the sportsbook located right between us, we had our meeting spot. Elevator service was quick and trouble free, despite being a sold out Labor Day weekend. I have stayed at MGM, Aria, Ceasars, Venetian, Palazo, Rio, Orleans, NYNY, PH, Paris, Harrahs, Bellagio, Mirage, TI (perhaps I should have listed where I have not stayed...) point being, I have been to Vegas a lot for many different reasons... MB & The Hotel hit it out of the park for this visit. Although located at the end of the strip, it is close to airport ($13 cab) and the monorails makes it easy to get mid-strip and the Aria - Bellagio mono gets you to the mid-strip area to check out other areas... Thing was that with the wave pool and lazy river, the boys did not want to leave MB! Again, it was holiday weekend, sold out and crowded, but, we were able get lounges and enjoy the whole outdoor experience. The boys loved the Lazy River, as did a vast array of folks - young & old... We ate each day at MB restaurants and the food was plentiful, high quality and quite reasonable. Many choices to fit any budget. Casino is large and lots of action. Only negative is that on both check in and check out, the lines at front desk were long (20 mins. wait) and employees behind the counter seemed as frustrated as the guests. They need to do a better job there. Outside of that, the electronics, internet, the whole experience was awesome! Exceeded my expectations."

After three levels of management and waiting still no reason was given. They were eventually given a room at the MGM that was supposed to have been taken care of, it was not. Huge inconvienance. The hotel elevators were very slow and usually resulted in long lines and waits. As for cleanliness the rooms were average at best with sticky dresser handles and dirty night stands. Bed was comfortable and clean. Check out line was long with only one desk agent working at 7am. Our bill was wrong and needed a persistent Attitude to have corrected. Desk agents were not happy people! All other staff encounters were nice and helpful. Pool staff were fantastic. I will not return.

The rooms were very clean and well kept and well decorated. Everything was in good repair. I really very much liked the design of the room - layout, furnishings, fixtures, even the toiletries - were just a bit special. The minibar was annoying (see other people's posts) - especially as it was so full that there was no place for anything of our own. Elevators were slow. The resort fee was annoying because the Cardio room has no weights (they're in the Spa for yet another $25) and little else is covered. Did a little gambling, which was fun. I liked this place but I might try somewhere else next time, especially if we go on our own the next time - just to see what the other places are like."

We brought our 11 and 15 year old boys in July 2011. As a member of the M Club, we got a great $49/night room rate. Unfortunately, the check-in process was disappointing. We arrived early and were promised a call when our room was ready, but never got one. After several hours of waiting, we went back to the desk and the room was ready. The rooms are adequate and large enough for our family of 4. The boys loved the TV in the bathroom! The main reason to stay here with kids is the pool area. The boys enjoyed the lazy river and wave pool. Be prepared to go down to the pool early to get your chairs as it fills up very fast in the summer. If you want to use the lazy river, we recommend bringing your own tubes. Bought ours at K-Mart for $4 vs. renting for $15 or $20 a day. They will fill them up for free. If you have packing room, also bring along large styrofoam cups to bring your own ice to the pool to keep your drinks cool. We did not eat at any main Mandalay restaurants but there is a McDonalds next door at Luxor if the kids need their fast-food fix. From a kids perspective, the Mandalay lacks an arcade. We tried bus transportation for the first time and found it pretty convenient to get downtown. The ticket station is in front of the hotel on the sidewalk, but the bus stop is across the street and further down in front of Luxor. Be prepared for a crowded, many-stop ride during peak times. Off-site kids activities: Gameworks, \"Pawn Stars\" pawn shop, Hoover Dam, and Las Vegas sign. The boys were glad they got to see the sites of LV that they've heard of or seen on TV, but one time for them was enough!"

The room we reserved, which I believe was a SD550 appeared much larger on their website than it actually was. The bathroom was very nice with the shower and tub separate, I just wish the room itself had been larger than your standard hotel room. We ate at Raffles Cafe and it was ok. Our table was sticky and the floor needed vacuuming. Food was standard. We also ate breakfast one morning at Red White and Blue, very good food and staff was excellent. The casino is large and had a lot of variety in slot machines. I was a little disappointed in the security staff to handle the amount of drunk people near the elevators. Also felt a little unsafe playing the slots by myself late at night, didn't see security much. Didn't spend much time alone down there. Overall it was an ok place to stay, they are at the far, south end of the strip, so you either take the tram, walk, drive or taxi your way up the strip. I personally like to have multiple casinos next to each other to visit and be within walking distance of each other. If you stay towards the south end, stay at NYNY, MGM or Excalibur. For mid to north end we really like the Venetian...really nice, large rooms and you can get good deals if you sign up for their email newsletter."

It's a massive place, so the walk to the pool is quite long but very much worth it. Their restaurants are excellent too and their buffet is definitely great value. We also got very very lucky ... seems they over-booked at the time so we were moved into a beautiful suite at The Hotel. This of course was just amazing ... but we'd love the environment even if we'd stayed at the Mandalay rooms. If you have a couple of kids with you, as we did, and IF you can splurge, you must definitely upgrade to one of these suites. The bedroom area is separate and there are 1+1/2 bathrooms, which makes getting ready a lot less stressful. Definitely eat at The House of Blues."

Catching the third lift was a regular occurence particularly over the holiday. The pool hours are 8am to 7pm but it closed early on at least 4 of the 7 days we were there including once at 4pm. Add to this the 'Resort Fee' of $20 plus tax per day for stuff I didn't use or want (free WiFi, USA Today, gym etc) and which was not mentioned when we booked in although there was a slip of paper in the key card thing. No mention of it in the room or, I believe, in the information guides in the room. I just felt ripped off. Finally I want to email my comments on my return to the UK and discover that I cannot email them. Can't imagine why they don't want to receive feedback."

My prior experience in a casino met me with a plume of disgusting cigarette smoke, but not here. I didn't have to wait long for elevators which was great since I was up and down and back and forth to the conference center. The conference center was okay. My biggest complaint was it's horrible internet connection and wifi capability. It literally hampered some of the speakers' classes. The swimming pool area was awesome. I was alone but my kids would've loved that wave pool. It was nice to take a few minutes to relax out there. The room was clean, and well laid-out. I hated the pillows on the bed. I have a small head but those pillows were REALLY small and uncomfortable. Also, I brought my iTouch to listen to on the advertised iPod capable radios. Unfortunately, my radio was not working. No big deal but, if it's advertised, it would be nice if it actually worked! Other than that, it was a great stay. Free trams to the Luxor and Excalibur resorts provided quick access to the famous Vegas strip. I'd stay here again."

Check in was a breeze. Reservations were in the computer system and the rooms were ready. We purchased tickets for Lion King at check-in and were upgraded for free. Eating in the hotel is limited. Very limited. The rooms were nice for the price. Outside the window was the top of the pyramid next door. Unless yoiu intend to use everything the hotel has to offer, fight to have the hotel resort fee waived. It's a scam, and it is charged daily to each room. The resort fee $20-$25 per night charges you for services whether you use them or not, like the spa, gym, internet, even calling an 800 number, daily newspaper and other things. The fee is on top of the actual charge to use these amenities. I read that some hotels will waive them if you push for it."

The line for invited guests to register was ridiculous, with almost an hour wait to check in! Also, waiting for the elevator every time was not fun, they took forever. We ate at Strip Steak while we were there and it was an awesome meal! Also the bar at strip steak made yummy drinks but had a very limited selection for their happy hour. I would stay here always if it weren't for their tram shutting down so early at night. They are in a bad location and then on top of that they close their tram down early? I don't get it? Also, casino is never overcrowded here which is a plus. I will be staying here again."

    "content": "I have stayed here before, but this is the first time I decided to review it. I must say the hotel management has thoroughly worked out every guest comment/concern. The room seemed to have every convenience including a comfortable bed, modern decorating, large bathroom, a large TV monitor and multiple amenities. This hotel does not provide a guest use refrigerator or in-room coffee maker. In fact they warn you at check-in that the mini-bar is weighted electronically and will charge if anything is removed and replaced with personal items. Strange warning, I guess... The Mandalay Beach/pool can be a lot of fun. I prefer the lazy river and the wave pool. I like the private showers by the pool for guests like me who have checked out at 11am on their last day, but want to use the pool. My flight back home was not until that evening and this allowed me to shower and change for dinner. My only negative comment - the $22.40 resort fee-shouldn't I be able to get more than one towel at the pool? For your $22.40 per day resort fee, you get in-room wireless internet, cardio center access, daily newspaper, local and 800-number calls, outgoing faxes, and boarding pass printing. The internet is good for today's travelers, but local calls and outgoing faxes-not many people are taking advantage of this anymore. Furthermore, boarding pass printing has typically been free in the lobby of most hotels and most are giving you free access to their workout room without a fee. Still, I will return to this hotel providing I find a good rate to make up for the resort fee and multiple taxes."

Other then that, the wave pool was welcome and made you feel like you were at a beach instead of a pool. The lazy river wasn't worth the effort to many people to really make it lazy. The beer was extremely over-priced....but that's like everything in Vegas. If they have a cheap deal I would stay here again....but it would be hard any other time just because of distance."

I would suggest you either have extra money in your account if your using a debit card or use your credit card for everything. if using a debit card they preauthorize everything then do the actual charge. so it looks like your being charged double until 3-5 days after your stay then your account will go back to normal. With temperatures being over 100 we rented a cabana for $275 day. not knowing you can rent an umbrella for $100 for first come first serve we would have been ok with the umbrella. but it was nice having a cabana with your own locker, tv, lounge chairs, refreshments, and table. great hotel would defintely be back."

Of course cocktails cost a small fortune, but to be expected in Vegas. There was a large selection of restaurants to choose from. We went to the Foundation Room which came highly recommended by the concierge. It is on the 62nd floor. I felt like I was in a haunted house. It was extremely dark in there with all these corridors that you have no idea where they lead. A small patio outside has amazing views of the strip and is worth the trip up there. I wasn't really impressed with the atmosphere of the lounge itself though. Went to a concert on the Beach at Mandalay (B52's and Human League) It was a lot of fun with a casual atmosphere. You can sit in the sand or stand in the ankle deep beach entry pool. This was a great way to enjoy a concert and will definitely go back again. The wave pool had way to many kids for my taste, so if screaming kids isn't your thing during the day I would go to one of the other pools available that are adults only. There may have been more kids due to the holiday weekend and may not necessarily be the norm. All the pools and lazy river are really nice."

    "content": "Mandalay Bay is one of the premiere hotels of Las Vegas, however, like many of the MGM properties including Luxor and MGM, it has managed to tarnish its brand and its appeal by reducing room rates that start at just $89 now. A few years ago, you would be hard pressed to find a room for less than $130 even in off-peak days. So what is wrong with a cheaper room rate? Well, it means that some of the little things that matter, start falling by the way side. I checked in to the hotel last week, and here are somethings that I found a little disappointing: -- The light switch by the door did not turn on any lights in the room. It turned on a very dim light by the entrance, but I had to find the light knobs on the individual lamps in the dark. -- The chair provided in the room needed to have been re-upholstered. It was filthy. -- The bed was plain uncomfortable. It had a mattress pad on it (which I did not ask for) and sleeping on one side of the bed meant sleeping slanted. -- There was no TV schedule guide in the room so I had no idea what channel was what unless I manually flipped through every channel. Having said that, the room had a bright and shiny flat screen TV and the bathroom was impeccable. But what I like most about Mandalay are the options for lounging and eating. They have Rum Jungle, Red Square, Minus 5, Burger Bar, Mix and plenty more, which really matters if you are looking to have a great evening, without leaving the hotel. The pool at Mandalay is of course, one of the most popular ones in Vegas. They have not only a pool that has waves to emulate a beach, but also one that you ride a tube in around the premises. Overall, Mandalay remains one of my favorite hotels in Las Vegas with plenty of action, great restaurants and lounges. They do need to refresh their rooms a little but all in all, a great value for your money!"

We were never allowed to sign anything to our room because according to the desk we never gave a credit card.

I spoke with the manager and she miraculously finds me the rooms I reserved. I also asked why all the registrations desks were not used and how they can allow us to wait 40 minutes in line, yes 40 freaking minutes. Liz's response was that they are breaks. What, its a day before the holiday and you don't have any foresight to staff appropriately? That's incompetence. One of the non-smoking rooms we got was smoked in so I had to request for another one, which they found for me. The rooms are very dated and if there is a concert going on that weekend, don't expect to get any rest before midnight. Yeah, it's that loud and we were on the 15th floor. This is suppose to be a 4 star hotel. I would give it a 3 star at best. Oh, please stop nickle and diming your customers by charging them a \"Resort Fee\" of twenty or so dollars a day for internet service. Ballys don't charge it! Btw, we went on Priceline and got the hotel for $80. I'm glad we didn't pay more than this for this place!!! One more thing, if you have a 6 am departure, don't leave no later than 4 am.

    "content": "We just returned from 4 nights at Mandalay Bay - with our two boys (ages 15 and 12). This is our (husband and myself) 3rd stay at Mandalay Bay. Obviously there are enough pros to have us return, but we've learned...First our flight arrived (from Seattle) into Vegas at 8:00am. We were checking in to Mandalay Bay by 9:00am....no lines at that time! If you plan on checking in between 2 and 6 expect to wait in some very long lines. Anyways, of course our room wasn't ready (we were prepared for that) so we headed straight to the pool. We had put our swimsuits in a beach bag so we didn't have to dig through luggage and then had the bell desk hold our bags. We were hitting the pool area by 9:30 - not so crowded at that time so it was easy to find chairs. Of course we arrived on a Tuesday, by Thursday it was much busier and Friday and Saturday was a complete zoo. Apparently they have 2000 beach lounges, not nearly enough because people were putting their stuff anywhere. Oh, and also don't expect much shade. They do have cabanas you can rent for a minimum of $200 for a day, and there is a roped off section with umbrellas, again for a fee, but if you aren't willing to pay then my tip to you if younger looking for shade is to get lounge chairs by the lazy river...one side will give you morning shade and the other side will have afternoon shade. Oh, and if you visit during \"vacation\" times do expect kids - lots of kids. I gotta believe Mandalay Bay attracts most families out of most of the strip hotels, because of the kid friendly pool area. If you are not into kids, splashing, and tons of water wings then rethink your stay here, or at least the time of year. Oh and speaking from a mom's point of view....to all of you single party animals, please be respectful and aware of who is listening to your foul language. Moving on, the beachside grill has great food, and the burger bar is also great - although $19 for a individualized burger is rather expensive. Our room was fine, however our sheets were torn and old, there was an odd stain on the celing (room 34-205), was incredible difficult to get a hold of guest services (for more towels), no coffee maker in room and the fridge is pre stocked....aka you can't put your beer in it, if you do housekeeping will remove it, oh and we never got our room cleaned before 4pm. Also, we rented a car, cuz Mandalay Bay is not conveniently located. M.B. Had free self park as well as a very organized valet (which we did). There is a tram to Luxor then on to exclaimer then the skywalks to New York New York and MGM is across the street....every thing else is far - remember the strip (from M.B. To the Stratosphere) is 4 miles. The $20 daily resort fee includes access to the little gym - if you want to use the spa area that is an additional $25 per person per day. Other comments: We saw the Cirque de Soleil Love show - it was good, not the best Cirque show, and Cosmopolitans Wicked Spoon buffet was a 10 for creativity and presentation, however just a 6 for taste. Our best buffet is still Treasure Islands...."

Check in was a little time consuming. Rather than one main line, there are numerous separate lines leading to each check-in person; this seemed to be inefficient when you happen to choose a line with problems... Also, the elevator situation was ridiculous. Thursday wasn't bad, but Friday through Sunday got progressively worse. One trick we learned was to take the elevator from the beach level, rather than the casino level. It's not as easy when you're stuck on your room floor. I waited almost 30 minutes for an available elevator to the lobby when I was trying to check out this morning (the worst by far). I heard many other guests complaining about the same issues. I heard more than one person say the had never experienced anything like this at another Vegas hotel (which I agree with, having stayed at the Bellagio, Bill's Gambling Hall and Casino, and the Venetian). I found the room pretty average. The room was a good size, but the carpet was worn and there were dark hairs stuck in the bed spreads and shower. Also, there seemed to be a trick to flushing the toilet. Sometimes it flushed great, other times it was half -hearted and took almost a minute. The pool area is the highlight. I would recommend bringing an inflatable inner tube for the lazy river. They sell them at the hotel, but I'm sure you can get a much cheaper one in your hometown. They have a wave pool, hot tub, and several other pools. I would recommend getting there early, as the lawn chairs are probably full by 10am."

    "content": "This was my first trip to Vegas as my older daughter was getting married in the chapel on a Saturday afternoon. My room was nice, clean, smoke-free, and bright, the beds were comfortable, and the pillows were great. The room had both a shower and separate tub, and there were dual sinks in the bathroom which was a nice touch. There was also a small TV in the bathroom, but it did not work. The view from the room was out over the pools, and the room was essentially quiet. Now for what I did not like. The elevators were not too bad early in the morning, but by late morning and into the afternoon/evening, they were crowded beyond belief, and the wait time was unreasonable. Regarding the pools, if you did not get a lounge chair at the pools/beach before 10:30am weekends, you couldn't get near the pools, they were that crowded. I saw families head to the pools before 8am just to get chairs, and the pools got pretty crowded quickly. And, unless you thought ahead to bring your own tubes, the hotel charged you $26+ for a tube to use down the Lazy River. I actually went into that pool without one and enjoyed flowing along by myself, so you don't actually need a tube. There was \"free\" wifi in the room which is OK if you remember to bring your own computer. If not, the hotel charges you $1/minute with a $5 minimum on a credit card to use the Internet in their business center. Printing your boarding pass is free. The hotel also charges $22.50/day as a resort fee, but I do not know what you get for that. There is a fitness center which you have to pay an additional fee to use, but the cardio center is free. There does not seem to be any coordination between the hotel and the wedding coordinator, and my daughter was scrambling around trying to coordinate the reception room, her honeymoon suite, and checking out of her other room prior to the actual wedding. Nobody was helpful, so better check with the hotel staff if you have any intention of getting married there. There was such a lack of communication between the wedding coordinator and the hotel. We survived a disaster only because of family help. This is a nice hotel, but you do get charged for everything. IIt is the last hotel on the Strip, and the monorail that runs between the Mandalay Bay, the Luxor, and Excalibur is good, saving you time from walking."

Don't even think about touching anything in the mini bar as it will cost a fortune! Also, ignore any temptation to summon room service! I checked out the most expensive bottle of Jack Daniels i have ever seen....... $270 delivered to your room.... Wow! Most of the porter staff seem to be on the make and in all fairness, must make a fortune in tips from the wealthy visitors here. Great job if you can get it! There are many good restaurants in the resort and its worth shopping around for offers as many are pricey. Look out for BOGOF offers etc on certain days. In all fairness, Vegas is always expensive and this hotel is one of the better ones. I have just booked to stay here again for New Years Eve 2011 so it must be pretty good. Suck up the price and enjoy it. It's a great place to stay!"

Now, my roommate and I were put into a handicap room, so the closets were lower, the tub was lower, there was a fold down seat in the shower that got in the way, and the toilet was not in it's own lockable room, but for the most part, it was still a pleasant stay. There were some minor things that made this hotel not as great for me. For one thing, the pillows had makeup stains on them (they even changed them each day and there were makeup stains in different spots!) and the towels were hard (one of my pet peeves). The beds were alright, but I arrived a few days before the convention and stayed at the Luxor hotel next door (we had discounted rates there) and the Luxor beds were heavenly! My opinion may be skewed a bit since i literally had a wonderful hotel experience right before staying at the Mandalay Bay, but the 2 things I listed I would've counted against them regardless."

The pool area is amazing and was not all that busy considering everywhere else - we got there first thing and would be gone by 11-12.

Mandalay Bay is at the far end of the strip but we found by using the monorail it didn't take anytime to get right into the middle of the action. We had a wonderful birthday dinner in the Foundation Room. The food was great but what made it really special was the attentive staff. They made us feel really special and it was one of the highlights of our trip. Also, magnificent views of the strip from up there! Also, pre-dinner drinks at the Aureole were fantastic. Great atmosphere and the staff were outstanding. Could not have had a better time. Make sure to get down to the wave pool early if you are hoping to get a lounger even remotely close to the water. Our only complaint was that the loungers are packed so tightly to gether it is really difficult to negotiate your way down to the pool and up to the restaurant. There is poolside drink service which we liked but be warned it is also pretty expensive. We were really happy to discover a lot of really healthy food options at the \"beach restaurants. I would absolutely recomend Mandalay Bay - hoping to go back for a second trip with the man for a funfilled couples trip soon!"

The pool was just okay as it is really more of a family pool (if that is your thing you will like it). The wave pool really was not as nice as advertised and the lazy river required that you actually buy an inner tube (rip-off) to go down this very small lazy river, don't think this is like Atlantis in the Bahamas because it is not. That being said, we rented a cabana which was a good experience. It came stocked with water (in vegas is a must) and the service and prices for food and beverages were reasonable. The casino was nice as we never had trouble finding good tables and friendly dealers. The restaurants in the hotel were adequate (although we mainly ate at other hotels)."

Room had everything we needed although the bed wasn't the best, a proper duvet would be a great addition. Pool area is amazing but you have to get there early to get a lounger. So many people leave there towels on the beds and never return. It says one hour allowed away from the beds but no one enforces this and on a weekend this is essential. Pool, Jacuzzi, Wave Pool, it was tough to choose which one to go in after lying in the sun! Casino is brilliant, it helped that we came home with a good few dollars after hours spent playing Blackjack. Felt comfortable playing, table minimums covered everyone's budget even with the weekend increase. Free drinks kept on flowing and the staff were all very friendly. So much choice for food, we ate at Stripsteak, Fleur and Ri Ra the Irish Bar and all were exceptional. We paid $250 for a meal at the first two but it was worth every penny. Ri Ra was great for a fry up early morning whilst watching Man United, bar staff were so welcoming. My only two major gripes for the whole week were, one the lifts (17-34) were so slow at peak times and two, the Walls are paper thin so if you have some drunken loud mouth staying near you, your bound to hear every word. Thoroughly recommend this hotel, it's a fantastic resort at an affordable rate. Not interested in staying anywhere else when we come back next year."

    "content": "On our 2nd stay there, we found MGM's Mandalay Bay still among the very best hotel experiences in Vegas. All the the Vegas glam and excitement are there, but as a family with young kids we felt we could enjoy a nice family holiday. We never felt \"tolerated\" as kids are at some of Vegas' other higher-end addresses, and in fact Mandalay's consierge was great with recommendations for family-friendly activities. The \"Lion King\" theater show is superb--relative to most of the Strip's offerings it's high art, and the Shark Reef was a tr[p highlight for our son. Our room was clean, ultra-comfortable, and well-decorated. Room service was delicious/good service. The lazy river and wave pool were fantastic for the kids, the best family-friendly \"beach\" on the strip (you can always go to the Moorea section for adults-only pools/cabanas). Thanks, Mandalay, for keping the time-share salesmen out! They're a buzz-killing nuisance elsewhere on the Strip. On the downside: -- the \"resort fee\": it's a hidden expense covering services that hotels worldwide build into their nightly room rates, but MGM properties, including Mandalay, make it an unpleasant surprise that makes their rates look artificially low, and I hope the company revisits this. I still give a 5-star rating to Mandalay as this isn't specific to the hotel, and even with the \"resort fee\" the hotel was a good value. -- Inner tubes: unless there was some awful problem with guests stealing inner tubes at the lazy river (I really doubt it), making guests buy a tube (not just rent, but buy!) is goofy and not what I'd expect from a high-end property. Finally, tech suggestions: Adding a wi-fi or hardline printer to rooms would be an easy but very helpful addition to those like me who have to work a bit on holiday. Also, adding Blu-Ray (not just DVD) players to rooms would be a great future addition. You have very nice widescreen flat-panels in the rooms, which are wasted on Vegas' weak TV offerings. Overall, a great stay!"

We all decided that the thing to do was have a pool party on Friday and rented a private beach bungalow. These are located just inside the entrance to the Mandalay Beach area and access is permitted only to those on the guest list. There are approximately 8 units that share a pool that runs the length of the enclosed area. One or two of them also have their own jacuzzi. Inside is a mini refrigerator stocked with water and soft drinks, a flat screen TV, sound system, table with chairs, a daybed and lots of extra towels. There were several servers that came by throughout the day and made sure our every request was taken care of. We had a total of 11 people and what a great time we all had! Definitely the highlight of our trip and was talked about the entire weekend. My husband and I stayed in one of Mandalay's Media Suites for a splurge. My overall impression was WOW as far as size and the view but there were a couple of things that could have been better. For instance, we called to ask if we could hook up a Playstation and were told \"yes\". However once we got the tech guy up there to help he said that we needed an audio cable and it was not provided....bummer since that was going to be our source of music for the weekend. We both thought that the towels should have been much more plush and larger since we were paying for one of their premier suites. Still a great experience for a once in a lifetime celebration."

We arrived to the front of the hotel to be told that valet was full, after a bit of huffing and puffing and explaining that we were there to \"check in\" they allowed the car through so that we could get our luggage out etc, not the best start but you take it in your stride. The time we arrived to the check in desks was 3.45 pm. There were lots and lots of booths for check in, however there were only 3 people manning them and the queue was crazy. More and more people were arriving, and one of the attendants actually decided it was a good time to take a break so we were down to 2 for 10 minutes. As a surprise my husband had booked a spa treat for me for 5pm, and we were getting seriously hacked off regarding timing, this was not hte romantic start we were hoping for, they were seriously seriously understaffed. By the time we got seen and got to our room it was just under an hour later, I litterally dumped my bags down and ran to the spa forgetting my swimming costume in the rush which was a real shame as I didn't have an oppotunity after my massage to use any other of their spa facilities which looked fabulous. Later on that evening, we realised that on check in they had given us two key cards, but only 1 was working, so we called down to the front desk to ask them to have one sent up.. no can do, come down to get a new one, OK thats understandable. So he headed downstairs to speak to the front desk, 30 minutes later, i went to find where he was and he was still queueing to speak to somone. Concierge said they could'nt help, and front desk was again packed, now bear in mind we had already checked in this was their mistake. I called somone over to the queue to explain that we were guests but our key card wasn't working, and she told us to just \"wait in line with everyone else\". What really annoyed us, was when someone else got into conversation with her, and she then opened up a desk for them to deal with their issue. When they had finished, she went to leave when my husband marched over to her and said, we're away for our anniversary, our room key isn't working we've waited over 30 minutes, this is ruining our time away, please can you just swipe it or whatever so we can get on, her answer was \"I've logged out of the system already\".. very calmly (more than I was) he said \"Its OK, i'll wait!\" This place could be great and the facilities are really really good, but they are terribly terribly understaffed which just ruins the whole experience, we've stayed in many hotels in and around the strip and I have to say even with a nice pool, this will not be one that I'll be going back to any time soon. These big hotels when they get it right its fabulous, but when they get it wrong its absolutely awful. The following morning we went to the pool. The wave pool was disaapointing, bascially, its a smallish wave that comes on every 90 seconds, after it happens 3-4 times your bored, and the lazy river was also pretty boring. If you want a great lazy river, the one at the MGM Grand is absolutely fabulous, this had nothing to it. There was also a massive shortage of sun loungers, as we were checking out early we got to the pool at 9, I'm sure people had come down, and put towels on sun loungers and moved on because for the amount of people in the pools and the loungers that were seemingly occupied there was a huge mismatch. In terms of the facilities they are good, the rooms are comfortable, the strip view is great, and pool is just ok. Would I recommend it, NO, spend your money elsewhere, its too big, too badly run, too understaffed, and even with the airconditioning, you'll get very very hot under the collar."

I've never seen so many \"Wolfgang Puck\" restaurants, (or similar), -- and so many Gucci, Chanel, Rolex, etc., shops anywhere. I guess some people are rolling in dough. Good to know that even in such a bad economy that some people are doing so well that they can afford to drop $69 on a hamburger meal...

However, this year at check-in there were only 2 lines open on Thursday evening, the opening night of the event. The elevator waits were long but that was tolerated. The customer service experience that displeased me most was waiting for greater than an hour for clean bed linen when I was ready for bed at 12am and saw the stained sheets that had been placed on our bed obviously by housekeeping during the day while we were out. The manager whom I spoke with twice after placing 3 calls about the sheets said that she couldn't come and when I asked about picking some up possibly downstairs, she said that they didn't carry them and I'd just need to wait for housekeeping. Of course housekeeping showed up a hour later and said that they had just found out about my need. Total disappointment on the last night to my 6-day stay."

The service is terrible and you wait, wait, wait sometimes to no avail for everything. Lets begin with checking in where we waited 25 minutes. Lets move onto the elevators where there is clearly a problem. You can wait for up to 20 minutes for an elevator going both up and down. This hotel is not staffed properly. There is not enough personal to accommodate their guests. I assume they put all their guests on floors 17-34 to get a better handle on things and all it causes is a complete traffic jam in the elevators and hallways. No one when I stayed there seemed to be on floors 2-16. When you call down to the front desk to speak to someone about it you wait 20 minutes so you hang up. Forget about the pool area. In the four days we were there my friends and I shared one lounge chair. If you are not at the pool by 8 AM you are not getting one. Lastly we arrived at the Spa half hour early and of courses waited again to be checked in 20 minutes."

Their pool area is very nice may be the best for Families with kids in Las Vegas.Also they have wave pool and two or three other smaller pools and a privet one.You must have a room card to enter the pool area. The casino is huge and clean but the service of a drink is terrible.Not too many players and the staff is little rude.So I was going to MGM to gamble when I wasn't tired.But overall the hotel is very nice and we would definitely stay there again."

Stayed at Bellagio and they have the same number of elevators and we never had to wait there! The cardio room was always packed, had to wait for machines to open as there is no time limit on machines. Have to pay extra if you want to use any weights, they are in the spa. During our stay a kid pooped in the pool and their idea of \"disinfecting\" was a gallon of chlorine and closing the pool for 2 hours. GROSS!!!

The fitness center is in the spa and quite good, but they charge you more than any other gym would for a worse product, The parking is good. The Italian restaurant has pretty good food to eat before you go out for the night. MIX is a cool club/lounge. The prices for rooms vary depending on when you book (I stayed for a great price, but I wouldn't spend more than $140/night for the basic rooms here). Overall, it's better than some of the older Vegas hotels, but you're better off staying at Aria or Caesars."

    "content": "This is the second time we've stayed at Mandalay Bay and although some complain that it is too far down the strip, we found it not to be a problem. We used the trams to get to several hotels and the monorail for some longer trips. The cost of the monorail is not bad if you are buying an all day ticket ($12) and using it frequently. Otherwise it's $5 a ride. Our room was showing a little wear and tear but still was very nice and comfortable. We were careful not to touch any of the snacks in the room as we were warned that there was an electronic sensor that would charge your room if you picked them up. The \"beach\" as the pool area is called is very nice but they do charge for the chairs under umbrellas as well as the cabanas. Cabana rentals start at $200 but include a couple of tubes for the lazy river and wave pool. The tubes alone are $27 each. Tip: tuck a couple of blow-up tubes in your suitcase. You can probably resell them when you leave for more than you paid for them. Two large pools and a few hot tubs are available as well. When you see the picture of their beach on the website imagine all that sand covered in lounge chairs. Mandalay has excellent restaurants and a nice shopping area that connects to Luxor next door. On our first stay a couple of years ago, we saw Mama Mia in the theater. This time they featured The Lion King which we were not interested in seeing. The theater though is very large and the staging of Mama Mia was excellent. Considering the special price we got for our stay, we were very pleased with the accommodations."

I would recommend Madalay Bay, even though its the last big hotel on the north end, the monorail makes it really easy to get around too.and free parking is something us Aussies are not used to either! I stay off the strip with family most times I vist, but usually always do 1 or 2 nights on the strip to just be in amongst it.

Although the room is clean and the bath tub was magnificent, it really did not match our expectations, the room got very little light and the furniture was quite old and worn including the bed, i did not sleep well the entire week i was there.

The Beach has a wave pool and a river to keep the kids (and adults) happy. One thing to remember is you must be 48\" to use the wave pool. Next to the wave pool is a wading pool for the younger kids who sneek up to and over the line to catch the tail end of the waves. Though it was quite crowded, we still managed to find lounge chairs without reservations. The room itself was nice and clean. We had a room overlooking the pool. The carpets were a little worn in both the room and the hallway. A couple of the entrance tiles were cracked. A little below the standard I was expecting at MB. The bed was big and comfortable. The bathroom was as big as some rooms I've stayed in. It had a seperate shower and bath, with a duel vanity. All in excellent condition. The only other negative experience I had was with the elevators. No matter what time of day, there was always a line for the eight elevators for the upper floors. I don't know if they were all in service or if the crowd was just too big. We also experienced seeing the Lion King and the buffet at MB. Both are a bit over priced. The quality of the buffet also has declined over the years. It was still very good, but not quite as good as in the past. Lastly, when visiting LV, you need to decide what you want to do once you're there. MB is at the extreme south end of the strip. Most, especially first time, visitors like to walk up and down the strip. Being at the end, it is not ideally situated for this. You can take the free monorail to Luxor and Excalibur, but after that you'll be walking and walking and walking to get to the center of the Strip. You can always cross over the the MGM from Excalibur and catch the fee monorail."

Later that night, the same problem but getting down. Then, we drove to dinner, came back to find that the valet was closed for guests. Not a close walk for kids or my elderly mother. Next morning, the same problem with the elevators. I called as it was just too much, and they said, \"Sorry, the hotel is full.\" Great. Head to the pool later that day and can't get a place to sit, the place is crowded, dirty, and I can't get a server for a drink for 30 minutes.

The bathroom looked like they had skipped cleaning it as a whole\u2013 there was hair all over the sinks. And I am not talking 1 or 2 hairs. It also took me about 45 minutes for my luggage to be brought up from the bell stand. The only saving grace was that hotel was vey helpful in getting me a new room at The Hotel at the same price I reserved the Mandalay Bay Hotel room. Also, the hotel as a whole was totally over priced. Even the Starbucks \u2013 I stopped at one in Monte Carlo, and everything was cheaper. ( even compared receipts because it was the same thing, same size). Even the casual restaurant, Red, White and Blue, was VERY over priced for what you got (I don\u2019t recommend eating there).

Check-In: After a 6 hour flight delay and a next day arrival, we were checked in very quickly with no delay. Room: Only two negatives, there do not have any hand towels just full size and mid-size towels. Our room was joined to another hotelers (considered shared/joined), who were not our friends and they complained our music was too loud and called security on us. We apologize for the noise and turned the music down but also clarified how loud we could turn up the tunes -- apparently with a joined room it really doesnt matter how loud or low you keep your music or voice, as the sounds go under the shared down in the room hallway and your neighbors can hear just about every word. *Tip: ask whether or not your room is considered shared/joined to avoid this type of issue. In Hotel Entertainment: Eye Candy Lounge - give it 3 out of 5 (the security guard Chris was awesome, he provided us with lots of information on other places to go after EC closed) Pool: very clean, enjoyed the wave pool but the heat was incredibly intense could only spend 30 minutes outdoors. Overall: I would return to this hotel next month is the opportunity presented itself **iHeart Music Concert**"

The wonderful pool areas, monorail and walkable connections to the pod of strip hotels, contained concerts and shows with vast restaurant choices, sumptuous spa and exquisitely well-appointed decor with a modern but soothing zen quality were just what our family with very active teens were looking for. But this year was different-and not in a good way. The pool area resembled rush hour in the subway stations of Tokyo. No chairs, a sardine fashion \"free-for-all\" in the pools overrun both unruly children and adults plowing into and knocking one down without acknowledgement or awareness of the need to change their behavior, trash floating in the water and pool towels strewn everywhere. No staff supervision. Not a good scene. Although comfortable , the rooms are definately showing their age. Ripped wallpaper, unsightly stained granite, graying carpet edges, significantly stained comforters brought to mind an \"ew!\" factor we had never experienced before at Mandalay Bay. Yes, the unusable refrig and weighted minibar without a coffee maker have always been an inconvenience. But we have never experienced having the soiled room service dishes/linens and food remnants from a previous room guest left at our door entrance for 2 1/2 days like we did during this visit. Not real welcoming . . .or hygenic. AND having to check in 2 1/2 late was new to us. Our suite was supposedly unavailable due to a late checkout of the previous guest. Not being upgraded to an alternate suite selection there or in an adjacent sister hotel OR monetary reduction for the time we could not access the room we had paid for? Just imagine how this rated on the inconvenience meter-especially since we had flown in from the east coast joining with family who we had fly in from Oregon to celebrate our son's graduation. Dinner and show plans were totally screwed and we were the only ones who seemed to care. Slots were tight. Casino not as well maintained as previous visits. And for the first time after many pleasant visits, the overall tone of the fellow patrons was stressed-out, snotty, rude and surly. Especially after wasting vacation time waiting for an elevator for over 45 minutes. Not the relaxing fun environment we were looking for and previously found at Mandalay Bay. And we were there to party! Not to look for a down side. As other reviews have indicated, elevators are a HUGE problem! HUGE! Yes, unsupervised children had a play in this pushing all the buttons on one elevator and then jumping on the next elevator to spread the inconvenience with glee. But they were the exception. The lines to entry of the elevator areas were ridiculously and consistently tremendous! Again, tremendous not in a good way. Guests were disgusted and furious about it. Although my spa experience there was stellar, all that relaxation was totally undone by mob rule and purposeful elbow jabs in the elevator. Just as I would not choose the Tokyo subway as a premier destination for a resort vacation, our family will be rethinking future visits to the Mandalay Bay. Staff supervision??? Was interesting to note (whether I wanted to or not) while being squashed in the pools with others who had paid a huge amount for their well-deserved family vacation, several LARGE groups of locals were sharing with us how their families came to the Mandalay Bay often to \"sneak into the pools\" as \"it is always unsupervised. No one ever checks. Why pay when you can get in for free?\" I was asked. Maybe because if the people who pay stop coming . . ."

    "content": "The best rooms in Vegas! FACT: Mandalay Bay has the biggest rooms on the strip - and we are talking standard rooms, not upgrades or suites and if you are lucky enough to get a strip view it really is the best view in the house. Most of the hotels face each other but Mandalay looks down the strip and to go to bed and to wake up to that view really will make it extra special every day you are there. (We booked a standard room and didn\u2019t even ask for a strip view and we got one) The wife and I between us have been to Vegas numerous times and each time staying in a different hotel inc the Venetian and Bellagio and Mandalay room v room, size, view, d\u00e9cor, bathroom has been the best. The pool/ beach/ gardens area is also a bit different to the Vegas norm and something to enjoy even if you don\u2019t want to spend time actually at your hotel pool/ sunbathing. I have done a review for the Bellagio and said it is the best hotel and the little things make it so, such as the lake, location, conservatory and lobby entrance, but just room on room Mandalay Bay is def better. And mentioning location, if you think being the end hotel it is the furthest away and thus not for you, traveller top tip: Get the bus! You might not think of yourselves as bus people but it solves this \u2018issue\u2019 and in general however near just the hotel after the next looks the walk is 3 times as long and think about it, if you are, for example, at Luxor and you know you want to go to the fashion show mall the bus really will prove invaluable for this or similar trips. Get a 2 or 3 day pass for $20 or so and hop on and off as well as use it to go to the recommended afternoon/ evening downtown to Fremont. Another tip, at least that we like, is to eat the buffet breakfasts/ dinner in different hotels rather than eating in your own every morning/ evening. Luxor, Planet Hollywood and MGM have, each time we have been, proved to have the best variety for something different as well as the staples you would imagine. Other things I recommend are; \u2022Cheesecake factory \u2022Blue Man Group show for an all round entertainment (rather than specific comedy, singer, cirque du soleil type) \u2022Bellagio fountains \u2022New York New York\u2019s dancing piano show \u2022Use the free magazines in the hotel room/ back of taxi\u2019s for money off coupons \u2022Drink plenty \u2013 stock up at CVS or ABC rather than paying top whack in the hotels Enjoy, Cosmopolitan or Wynn next year!"

Our Deluxe room had dirty sheets, and they were not readily replaced. So, when I complained, I demanded an upgrade to a Spa Suite. It took a while for them to switch our rooms, but they did comply. The nice suite made the dirty sheets issue easy to forget. Once we used the pool facilities, we completely forgot we ever had a problem.

    "content": "We researched who had the best water park in Vegas and all sources said Mandalay Bay was number one. What I failed to realize was that everyone else was reading these same reviews. We went to Las Vegas the week of July 4th with our 12 & 14 year old kids. Mandalay Bay is a very short ride from the airport. After we checked in (quick and easy!) we headed down to the beach area. Hmmm ... all the chairs are taken. OK. Let's go in the wave pool. It's wall-to-wall people, who are constantly bumping into you when the wave hits because there's simply nowhere else to go. Now let's try the lazy river. Have you ever been in a traffic jam with cars as far as the eye can see? Now add a lot of water and that's the lazy river. I didn't think either was fun but the kids liked it more than I did. Our room (a 550 DR) was exceptionally nice, with loads of amenities and a huge bathroom with tub and shower. But our room was on the 17th floor. There are 2 groups of elevators, for floors 2 - 16 and 17 - 34. So we were the last stop on the way down to the lobby. After letting many packed elevators go by, we learned to just jam ourselves in with a cheerful \"Excuse me!\" and ride down without looking at anyone else. We liked breakfast at Raffles Cafe ... just make sure you're there before 9:30 or plan on waiting 30 minutes or more. The Noodle Shop was very good for dinner but we had most of our meals at the House of Blues ... short lines, good food and a fun atmosphere with occasional live music. Mandalay Bay is on the far end of the Strip. Everywhere you go, it's an $18 cab ride. Next trip, I'd prefer something more central like the Mirage. So if you have your heart set on this hotel, come during the winter when you won't have the overcrowding at the water park to be a concern. Because the hotel is very attractive and well-maintained. There's less of a \"wow factor\" than at some newer places (Wynn, Bellagio, Venetian) but they work hard to keep it looking nice 24/7."

I have also stayed at Bally's, Paris, Venetian, Montecarlo, Luxor, Caesar's Palace, and Bellagio. - Pool looked fantastic and had a good crowd (I did not go) - Their show is The Lion King (I did not go)"

We stayed at The Hotel last time and this stay was just as nice, except for the crowded elevators. Our room was the 750 Suite and it was just beautiful. We had a full strip view, 23rd floor. The decor was modern and lovely, the room well laid out and the bathroom was very nice. There were no stains or worn items as others have complained about and the bed was incredibly comfortable. We also had no issues with the air conditioning. Our safe was not working when we arrived but a quick call to maintenance and they were there within a half an hour and I was able to unpack while we waited. Everyone there was very helpful and friendly, I just don't understand the complaints others have noted. The front desk was great, the cocktail service in the casino was excellent and the service in all the restaurants was outstanding. We could not have been more pleased. As far as the location of Mandalay Bay, we prefer being on the south end of the Strip because we like a casino where we can play without massive crowds and drunken people everywhere. We have been to Vegas many times and prefer this location. We took the free tram to Excalibur to access other parts of the Strip and walked up to Planet Hollywood and the Cosmopolitan from there. There were loads of kids everywhere this trip which we don't normally see since we usually don't go in the summer. We did not use the pools since we wanted to avoid the crowds there. We ate at Fleur by Hubert Keller, Wolfgang Puck's Lupo, The Cafe and Raffles. All were excellent and really excellent service everywhere. We love eating in Vegas! If you like the small plate/tapas style of dining, you should try Fleur. We loved sharing lots of different items and it was delicious and not that expensive. It was a great trip and we can't wait to go back!"

    "content": "If you are a Vegas virgin, this property may not be ideal for you given its location. As the southern most property on the Strip, Mandalay Bay is not convenient for first time exploration and hotel / casino hoping. However, if you have been to Vegas numerous times (as I have) and want to relax around your own hotel during the day and venture out via a long walk or cab ride in the evening, then this property is the best! By nature, its somewhat isolated location tends to keep the large crowds away (unless there is a large convention occuring on-site). This was at least my 5th time staying at Mandalay Bay and they have done a great job of maintaining it over the years. The pool environment is great for couples or kids. There are two large public pools, a wave pool and a lazy river. There is also the Morrea \"toptional\" adult pool which provides a day-club atmosphere, but I have not actually been in this area and am not sure what cover $ is. In terms of entertainment, the eyecandy sound lounge in the center of the casino is a hot spot most nights and there is no cover. The DJs mix contemporary hip-hop and dance music with music videos synched on several screens. You can also head up to the Mix, located atop THEHotel, and watch the sunset on the strip from 60+ stories in the air. Often times there is also free live music in the Mizuya lounge. Drinks at all bars are the standard steep Vegas price. For dining, I can personally recommend China Grill and Ri Ra. China Grill is a step above P.F. Chang's, offering delightful Chinese inspired dishes. Ri Ra is a casual Irish Pub located in the shopping area in between Mandalay Bay and the Luxor. Red Square is also a fantastic restaurant to stop in for a pre or post dinner martini or other vodka-centric beverage. The only drawbacks of this property are its location, slow elevators and additional daily resort fee of $22 (covers wi-fi internet access, cardio center and daily newspaper. While it may not be a great property for Vegas newbies, Mandalay Bay is my go-to hotel and is great for Vegas regulars."

One afternoon (a Wednesday) we waited 20 minutes for an elevator to get to the 19th floor. Our package through the travel service included free buffet, which we ate for breakfast and lunch- that was pretty good and there was a nice selection, but like everything else here, there were insanely long lines for everything.

If I had to give this resort a 1-5 star rating I would rate it a 2.5-3. The only reason it would even get a 2.5-3 is that is has a very nice pool area and a pretty decent room. The pool is in my opinion one of the best on the strip because of the large wave pool, huge sandy area, many \u201cnormal\u201d pools and a lazy river. The room we stayed in was the 550 basic room which consisted of a king bed that was certainly not the most comfortable (the last one I had at a Holiday Inn Express was much more comfortable), a table, dresser, small couch, and a nice bathroom. Now that I am done with the good part of this resort let\u2019s move on. From the get go there is a $22.40 \u201cresort fee\u201d per day. This is not made aware to the customer until you check in at the desk. I am not sure what this covers but it was certainly nothing the average Las Vegas resort customer would use. In the room there was a refrigerator with a mini bar in it. Understandably if you use anything out of it you will pay for it, but not just that here. The fridge is on a scale and if you put anything inside you will also pay. In other words, if you touch the fridge you will pay for it. Next on the list is the fact that there is no coffee maker. Upon calling the front desk to see if this was an oversight we were told there is no coffee maker and if you want coffee you will have to go to the lobby and buy it from Starbucks. Wow what great customer service. We were also told that there are coffee makers in the upgraded rooms but if you want to make a pot\u2026it will cost you $8 per pot! There was a TV in the bathroom which was kinda nice as to see while in the tub if you\u2019re into that. Only problem was no remote. Two calls and two trips by maintenance finally solved that problem. If you want to actually turn a light on in the room, good luck to you. With a long hallway from the entry into your room before you get to the living space it would have been nice to put a light or even a light switch in the hall as not to enter in complete darkness. Speaking of light switches, they\u2019re aren\u2019t any. You want a light, you need to find your way to it. Now let\u2019s see, it\u2019s hot in Las Vegas and you probably want an air conditioner in your room. I had to keep turning ours down and down and I don\u2019t believe it ever got below about 75 degrees. No covers while you sleep or you\u2019re going to be hot. Speaking of covers and beds, no fitted sheet on the bed and when looking under the bed for anything we may have missed when leaving guess what? Corn nuts! Not a bag but loose ones along with a lot of built up dust and dirt. Was the rest of the room even cleaned? The pool area was very nice with a large wave pool, some normal size pools, and a lazy river, and a large beach with real sand. Lots of open lounge chairs and several reservable ones as well as reservable cabanas. All at high dollar prices. Speaking of high dollar, if you want to enjoy a trip on the lazy river and do it lazily on a tube, well it will be $24 for a tube. No rentals, not included in any \u201cresort fee\u201d, or covered under your $260 per night hotel stay. Pack one of those in your suitcase and heck, you might as well pay to check a bag to bring your own and other items based on what they want for a tube. Upon checking out from the hotel, the checkout clerk asked \u201chow was your stay\u201d? I hemmed and hawed, so he said, \u201ca little of this and a little of that\u201d? I told him no and that the next time I come to Las Vegas I would definitely be staying somewhere else. You would think when a customer says something like that it would prompt a question like what did you not like? This person could care less if I had a great time or a lousy time so I proceeded to tell him my disappointments. His response, \u201coh\u201d. Not an I\u2019m sorry, what can we do to make it better or nothing. HE REALLY DID NOT CARE ONE BIT! If all you care about is a nice pool and nothing else this may be the place for you. I like more than that though."

The view (we were on the \"61st\" floor but I don't think there are actually that many floors) was amazing. It was quiet, too, as I don't think there were that many people staying on or floor. Our room had a huge shower and jacuzzi tub. They even left a \"bath fizzy thing\" should you elect to use the tub. There were 4 TV's including 1 in the full bath. The room was awesome. In the interest of full disclosure we did have a casino host take care of making our reservation. However, I was a little nervous about staying here after reading all the negative reviews on Tripadvisor. We did try several of the restaurants. We found Raffles to be quick and easy for breakfast. The portions were obscenely large and very good. There was a good mix of options on the menu as well. My husband and I definitely enjoyed staying at Mandalay Bay and would recommend it to anyone who ask. The only negative I found was that there were a lot of kids. And I mean a lot! The pool was filled completely with kids Fortunately, there are smaller pools scattered around the larger wave pool that we found to work for us."

Everyone from housekeepers to concierge want out of their way to be helpful. In general, I found the over all helpfulness of the people in Las Vegas to be much above average. As for the food, (We took advantage of their buffet package) I thought the buffet was above average and the Stripsteak House was better than Mortons or Chris. However, there doesn't seem to be an inexpensive coffee shop on location. My son and his wife took advantage of the pool amenties. They said it was very nice but a little crowded. If there is a drawback, its the the hotel's location. It is at the very end of the strip. It is a long walk to the middle of the strip. I would recommend a taxi or the bus."

You will have an easier time pushing the down button, go the basement/beach level and then push the floor you want to go to. It won't even stop at the lobby level. It's like an express elevator. Next tip, bring your own floatie for the lazy river and have it blown up for free at the swim shop. Final tip, and this worked out the best, go to restaurant.com and purchase gift certificates for the restaurants at the hotel. With coupon codes, you can purchase a $25 gift certificate for $2. Our group of 5 averaged around $15 per person for breakfast and dinner. I would stay here again. Loved the pools and the weather was perfect for lounging in the pool while reading a book."

When we stepped off the elevator headed towards our room, I knew immediately that we had made a mistake! The carpets need to be cleaned and vacuumed, and there are several doors that need to be repainted. At first glance of the room it didn't look too bad, but upon further inspection, I noticed hairs around the shower and around the sink area. And to top it off there was a hair in our bed! We placed the \"Relaxation\" sign on our doorknob, but we were disturbed 3 different times; twice by housekeeping and once by the guy restocking the bar. And I forgot to mention that the rooms are very noisy; you will hear alot of outside traffic and music. The nightlife of this hotel is pretty good, and we had fun during our stay. We decided to try to catch a red eye flight out the next night to avoid spending anymore time in our room. I spoke with the manager and she discounted our bill by $50...

    "content": "Let me start by saying that my husband and I have been coming to Vegas for years. First, when we were just married without kids and building up our comps and now with kids and my husband having a solid history in Vegas. We started out at the smaller, less expensive properties and worked our way up to Mandalay Bay a few years ago. At first, I was amazed by the service, amenities and overall luxury feeling of the resort. We are currently at the resort with family who have never been to Vegas and I am embarrassed. Where to start ... 30 minutes to wait for valet to get our car AND a bell hop to take our luggage .. even with VIP check in status. Breakfast at the cafe and even with half a restaurant of open tables there is a line out the door waiting to be sat and staff is rude when asked for estimates of wait time. Actually room at the pool this time but the kids \"aka lifeguards\" seemed more interested in talking with each other and dancing than the important job they are hired to do. My biggest disappointment is the room .. actually got a suite this time for the family to stay together and I am shocked. Every day we have found something in the room that does not belong to us .. a used large tube of moisturizer, hair clips and metal rings. The carpets look filty in the room and in the hallway leading to the rooms. Wallpaper hanging from the hall and water spots on the ceiling in the hallway. Pillows on the beds meant for adornment have cracked and broken buttons on them. The microwave looks like it went through a war and has dried crud on the top of it. When checking in, someone had piled dirty dishes outside of our door. After two days of the dishes staying there I finally called down to the desk and asked if they could be removed. The shower heads have a thick build up on them that affect water pressure .. could easily be removed by soaking in an over the counter product. Furniture is scuffed and falling apart. I could go on and on but what is the point ... Mandalay Bay you have lost your gleam and it seems like you don't care. I expect more from a luxury resort. Time to take our business to a resort that cares about maintaining itself."

I think the best feature of the hotel is the pool area. It is probably the best on the strip. With 2 pools, a huge wave pool, and a lazy river it has plenty for all ages. The casino was decent but as this was a more upscale hotel, don't expect to find $5 limit tables here. If you like slots, they had a lot to choose from and the casino wasn't that crowded so you didn't feel like you had to fight for a machine. For food, I recommend the Beachside Buffet. It was probably the best place we ate that week. Lots to choose from and the food was better than your average buffet fare. If you enjoy shopping, Mandalay Bay is connected to the Luxor which in turn is connected to Excalibur. There is basically a mini-mall in between each hotel so you don't have to go far to find good shopping. The only downfall to this hotel was it's location. It being the last one on the strip, it was well away from the other strip attractions such as the fountains, volcano, etc. You can walk it, but it is a haul or you can also plan on a $15-$20 cab ride to get up to Caesar's Palace."

After checking in the room we were given had not been cleaned by housekeeping yet and so rather than make the necessary arrangements to move us, we were told to bring all of our luggage back downstairs, wait in line again, get the key for a new room and then haul it all back up again. The mandatory resort fee of $30 a day basically gave us \"free\" internet service, which was not strong enough to connect my netbook. To resolve this problem, the desk clerk said we would have to stay in our room for about an hour, wait for a technician to come and then wait while he fixed the problem. Not a reasonable solution during my vacation! When we called housekeeping to bring up foam pillows rather than the standard issued feather pillows, it took two phone calls down and another wait of about an hour and a half. There were no where near enough lounge chairs at the pool, but a huge area had been arranged with pay-to-use lawn chairs and bungalows, at a cost starting at $75 per chair, not including use of the umbrella nearby. That cost was an additional $100 if you wanted to use the umbrellas. The rooms were dated, with uncomfortable furniture I would have expected in a hotel with the caliber of a Holiday Inn or Best Western. Maintenance workers were outside our room banging on something at times when we were trying to rest and the staff's demeanor was anything but friendly and concerned with our comfort. The only pluses I can find is that the bed was comfortable and the concierge workers, although extremely busy with long lines, were very helpful and pleasant. Not enough to make me go back again though!"

Here are the upsides and downsides: The food was absolutely phenomenal. The buffet (both brunch and dinner) were to die for. The selections were endless, the food was warm and the lines were reasonable and moved quickly. I have never had such an excellent array of different foods, and I've stayed at many many resorts. Also ate at the House of Blues, which was very good. The room service was also extremely good and arrived in a fair amount of time. We did request a high floor with a view of the strip. They had no strip views available, but we did get a high floor with a mountain view and it was very pretty, especially at sunset when the mountains glowed. The room was a bit dated but clean...not going to complain because of the reasonable price. The soaking tub & double sinks were much appreciated. I did hear someone sneeze from the other side of the wall, indicating thin walls but nothing too crazy, it was fairly quiet given it was Vegas. We also heard no noise from the strip or airport, so again, mountain view can be nice. The pool, wave pool and lazy (fast) river were all a lot of fun. It was definitely crowded, no chairs, but we just plunked our stuff down and got in the water, who cares? I'm not getting up at 7:30am to get a chair! Regarding the elevators, yes busy but realistically never waited more than 3 minutes. If there was a line, we simply took the escalator down to the beach level and jumped on an elevator there to bypass...takes 15 seconds and well worth it and only had to do that twice. We did bring our own tubes to avoid the $23 lazy river tube charge and they did blow them up for us free. I hit on their slots and their drinks were good (if you can flag down a waitress...you have to be bold, but that's the same everywhere). Staff were friendly. There were a lot of families there with children. Biggest complaint...too far down the strip. So, long and short, excellent if you want awesome food, are bringing kids or don't mind hopping a cab or limo to get where you want to go. I would stay here again. The Luxor next door was fun to hop the tram to as well."

Wallpaper was torn and hanging loose in the hallway. Hallway carpet was filthy. Took 45 minutes for bell staff to deliver bags to room....this was just the first 90 minutes. NOTHING over 3 days was anything better. Cigarette butts on the floor in the hallway, as well as used kleenix tissues in the hall that remained from morning through night. That this property is a AAA 4-diamond resort is a travesty. ALL communication with staff was countered with scripted responses, none of which was about facilitatiing a good guest experience, but rather with avoiding resolution. There is zero shade in the pools area that doesn't cost a minimum $200 a day to use."

    "content": "We stayed for 4 nights at The Hotel (August 5-9) which is it's own tower in the Mandalay Bay complex. All rooms are suites with a parlor area separate from the bedroom. The parlor area had a big flat screen TV and it's own bathroom with a long couch that you can sleep on but not too comfy. The parlor area also had a nice desk area too. The bedroom area was also very nice with plenty of room. The bathroom was the best! it had a large shower and a huge soaker tub and also had a small flat screen TV. Access to THE Hotel is easy, close to the parking deck if you have a car and not far at all from the sports book which is important to me. It is a long walk to the pool which also important to me but that was OK. If you want to be close to the pool, Mandalay Bay tower is better. If you are a pool lover, this is the place for you. It was very crowded though and August is not the busy time so be prepared to get to the pool early if you want a chair if you are in a small group. Mandalay Bay has all the bells and whistles when it comes to gaming, dining, and nightlife. You will not be disappointed. It is all the way on the far end of the strip so if you want to be close to the other properties that are mid strip it is a bit of a hassle to get to the others, Las Vagas blvd. is a huge parking lot so avoid that if you are making your way down the the other end, have your cabbie take you via the highway. I always rent a car and find it to be so worth it. I know my way around so it's very easy for me to get around in the car. If I had to make a complaint about THE Hotel, I would say that the rooms get a lot of noise from the hallways. You can hear everything going on in the hall and the adjoining rooms."

We splurged for a spa suite...which I would definitely recommend. We had a great trip! The service at the hotel was excellent. My only complaint would be the location...it is kind of out of the way, at the end of the strip. But we did take advantage of the tram that connected the hotel to both the Luxor and Excalibur. The deuce bus also makes a stop every few minutes at the front of the hotel. For the price, you can't beat Mandalay Bay. Some friends of ours stayed at Paris...the rooms there did not even compare with Mandalay Bay. They weren't nearly as big. We would definitely stay here again!"

There is no coffee pot, microwave or refrigerator in the room and if you want one of these usual amenities the hotel has the gall to charge you $35 per day EACH! Is this insane or what? They also have NO umbrellas available at the beach unless you are willing to pay $50 each per day. YES, I said PER DAY. They have a free cardio gym that is not big enough for the number of patrons that are in the hotel; however, they have a bigger and much nicer gym that includes weights that is available if you are willing to pay $25 PER DAY. All the restaurants and mini stores are quite expensive as well charging $3 for soda and meals are usually $15-30 each. This is so over the top. To make it worse they close the pool at 7 PM even though it is still 100 degrees outside and their coffee shops NEVER have adequate staff in the mornings. THe lines are usually 10+ people long. They have free wifi, but they do not have a free business center for those traveling without a computer. They charge $1 per minute! The hotel needs to get a grip and stock their rooms with basic amenities such as microwaves, coffee pots and refridgerators to make their stays more comfortable. Their focus should be the comfort of their customers, not how much money they can milk from them during their stay. THey should keep the pool open until at least 10 at night like even a comfort inn would do and add more staff to their coffee shops. THey also need to bring some restaurants in that don't charge and arm and a leg for a basic sandwich."

The public areas of the hotel are all that you would expect from Las Vegas, however we found the standard rooms a little tired. The design concept was obvious but the edges were starting to be a litte tatty in our opinion. I think we had higher expectations of a vegas strip hotel and would try another of the big hotels next time. Two things that upset at this location were the extra $156 charge the hotel attempted to levy on us for turning up later than normal check in (despite calling ahead) and secondly no coffee making facilities in the room. I expect to pay for everything in Vegas, but a forced $7 for a cup of tea from room service I object to. Starbucks in the lobby was our answer. Overall a very well appointed hotel suited more toward adults in our opinion. Not a bad hotel we simply had higher expectations."

I understand that they try to get you to purchase everything as much as possible. The refrigerator is on a sensor; so anyhting in the mini bar that is even removed and replaced, you are charged. Not sure how much, no price lists in the room. We were on the 5th floor, nice double bed room, staff nice, etc. The beach/pool are amazing and very nice. Drinks around the pool are expensive, $14 for a margarita! Bring your money!!"

    "content": "recently came to Las Vegas on a reunion birthday trip and spent 5 nights at your resort. We checked in on July 20th and out on the 25th, I would have gladly checked out much sooner. We were located in room 32231. Let me start by saying we have attended numerous Keller Williams conferences at the Mandalay and had been hoping for the same level of service we had come to expect. We had requested two queen beds and were told that no rooms were available so a lumpy cot was bought up and I got to sleep under the dirty air conditioning vent, the filter was filthy and i got sick. On the evening of the 21st however, after we had gone out to Smith and Wollensky for a birthday celebration I had to leave before I even started my meal or had any drinks. I took a cab back to the hotel and my key would not work. Due to the fact that I was extremely nauseas I called the front desk from the house phone. A gentleman, who had been singing for the wedding in the corner suite saw my distress and stayed with me, I did not get his name but wish I could send a note of gratitude. I waited for security to come and after being given the ninth degree I offered him my credit card and drivers licence, thinking that this would prove I was legit, still no....I asked if I could please go in the room to get a tissue..(and vomit) he said no and continued to give me flack. I reminded him that I had spoken to him earlier in the hall and he did recall the meeting. The gentleman was still there and offered me his handkerchief, as by now I was hyperventilating and my nose was running all over my dress. Finally after \u00bd an hour security asked me if I had any proof of my residence in the room, I assured him my passport was in the safe, finally I was let in. I have NEVER been treated like such dirt, why on earth would I be willing to give all my personal info to someone to break in to a room? My health continued to deteriorate and the week was most unpleasant, I wound up so sick I needed to go on strong antibiotics, never fun on a vacation, but due I believe directly to the dirty vent system. I had ordered some pricey chicken fingers to take with the antibiotics I was prescribed for my infection...housekeeping took the three fingers out and left them on the dresser with a note that a fridge could be brought up for medical purposes...seriously...that is a waste of resources as far as I am concerned...for 3 chicken fingers..come on..how many dollars are made off that pricey water and juice...we stayed at the Trump last week and they provided water, coffee and excellent service...night and day different. A much higher level of class, no cigarette or chemical stink and clean carpets...the halls on our floor at the Mandalay looked like there had been rooting animals tramping, and defecating throughout. We also had to let the front desk know that room service had been left down the hall for 3 days and that the strawberries had mold on them...another room had food that wasn\u2019t even describable. I was surprised also to see numbers of premium chairs cordoned off and empty...Again seems like a waste of resources. During our five day stay I may have seen one or two people rent them..likely comped or employees. I do a lot of business bookings and will be sure to skip the Mandalay from here on out...for the price, the lack of service and the rude contacts I made have left me bitter and jaded. I hope you take this too your your staff and work to build up better customer service. I will be making my report to the travel watchdogs. I understand you are new at this posting, when I called to speak to a manager I was given your name, told you were new and told I could not have a fax number..really..again..these people are your front line contacts in charge of first impressions.."

We chose to stay at Mandalay Bay because we thought out of all the hotels on the strip this would be most kid friendly. It is a beautiful, clean resort. The staff is very helpful and friendly. We upgraded our room to a 2 bedroom suite and the suite was amazing overall. The king size beds were comfy and we had a living room and dining room which we made use of. No microwave in the little kitchen area which was disappointing. They charged for wi-fi which I think is ridiculous and BE AWARE that when you check out you will receive a daily \"resort fee\" on your bill. Absolutely ridiculous for the price you pay. The pools are great but a couple of negatives. You have to purchase a float to use it in the lazy river....otherwise you can just jump on in and walk/swim around in it. The area they have for young children to use is great and my 2 year old LOVED it but there were no beach chairs with shade. The only beach chairs with shade were in front of the wave pool and of course sectioned off chairs with umbrellas. There were girls that came over to the \"kids section\" to lay out because they didn't want shade and were upset to be near the kiddy pool while my sister and I were upset that there was no shade for our kids. The hours of operation was disappointing. They open at 8:00 a.m. which is great but close at 7:00 p.m. If there is a special convention, etc. the pool closes at 6:00 p.m. I was looking forward to swimming once the sun wasn't so intense so we ended up swimming first thing in the morning. We loved the aquarium on the property. Perfect for little ones. We ate at some great restaurants on the property.....Border Grill was an amazing experience. House of Blues was fun. Knowing what I know about the Mandalay Bay I would not go through Allegient Air to book my vacation. I would book the flight and hotel separate. I would take a taxi instead of a shuttle because you will save money and you can leave the hotel whenever you want. I would stay there again but possibly try to get some things included in my stay. We had lots of fun."

Found a paper clip and a quarter on the floor and the carpet could have been cleaner. The hotel hallway carpets really need to be cleaned - lots of stains! View from my window was great - all the pools and the airport. Bed was comfortable and there were nice bath amenities. There were, however, some stains on the bath mat towel provided. A couple of complaints about the hotel overall include the elevators for which there was sometimes a 15 minute wait! Also, at the wave pool there is absolutely no shade unless you want to pay for an umbrella or cabana. There is a $25. charge for an inner tube to float on the lazy river. Bring your own to save some money. You can find some shade under the palm trees at the West and East lagoon pools so go there to avoid the blazing heat and sun."

The only negative is that you can't rent tubes for the lazy river. You have to buy them, which I think is ridiculous. It wasn't worth the cost for the amount of time I had to spend on the lazy river. I really think the hotel should provide them for free to guests, but I would accept a rental charge. Overall, it was a really nice venue for a convention, and easy to get to everything.

I arrived at about 10.30pm on a thursday night tired after a long flight and a three hour time difference,only to be confronted at check-in by a huge line-up and two overworked clerks processing the check ins. I didn't get checked in until past 11pm. Getting on to an elevator is a very enervating experience as the elevator lobby is extremely small and narrow and invariably packed with people who either begrudgingly make little room for those exiting the elevators or who rudely converge into the elevator not waiting for those trapped at the back of the elevator waiting to get off. Once in the room it was quiet, pleasant and clean enough with no issues. The air conditioning was quiet and efficient and the thermostat responded well. The bathroom was well stocked with amenities and the shower had good water pressure and temperature control. The only major disappointment is that the casino floor seems to be exactly as I left it four years ago with very few new if any additions in gaming inventory and very tight machines compared to some of the other properties I visited. Surprisingly,with the notable exception of the casino, morning,noon and night,all the other public areas in the property seemed to be booming (restaurants,bars..etc) and also disconcertingly countless large families with many noisy and annoying children marching to and from the pool like lemmings on a bender replete with air mattresses and rubber rings. Over my thirty six hour stay, I only had two breakfasts and one lunch. The breakfast was at the Raffles cafe which is a pleasant series of rooms with quite good breakfast food and attentive service. The lunch was at the Noodle Shop which was well priced and very good. As a family resort it seemed to be very popular but for adults who want to enjoy a proper Las Vegas casino experience, I found little to recommend it. The MGM resorts seem to have downgraded their properties in recent years and make them feel like downmarket desert bound Carnival cruise lines."

Sun-Wed is a different experience than Thurs-Sat when the wild weekend crowd arrives. If you must have a chair either get there early, arrive late in the afternoon or rent a chair or cabana. Rentals dont come cheap but they do give you some shelter from the sun...and if you split the cost with a few friends, I think its worth it. The cost for a lazy river tube is $20 or more so just bring your own. The store just inside the entrance to Mandaly Bay Beach will blow the tubes up for you, no charge. Dont forget there is a daily resort fee, and DONT TOUCH the stuff in or around the mini-bar in the room...once you lift it out of place for a few seconds, youre paying for it. Save yourself the headache and dont touch it to begin with !! I loved staying at Mandalay Bay. It was a wonderful vacation."

The front desk staff as every other employee we encountered were both rude and impersonal. The elevators leave something seriously to be desired since there is ALWAYS a 20 min wait. I feel the hotel caters to the lower end crowd since it seemed that most of the people staying there were pretty low rent. My guess would be that they were staying there on big discounts or even free. We gamble so we pay nothing, however even for free we would not stay there again. The casino: Poor variety of machines. Extremely tight offering little play. Very high limits for tables. MB must think they are the Wynn or something. Deplorable $25.00 limits midweek for Paigow and blackjack. At the end of the day I found this entire property very boring, impersonal, and crowded. I will be crossing this property off my list for the next trip we make."

For a quick lunch on the go, I have discovered the TexMex salad at Red, White and Blue cafe. Yummy! The most amazing thing about the Bay is the pool! Wave pool, sandy beach, cabanas and cocktails.

The hotel has so many options for dinning we tried most of the restaurants couldn't fault any, we really enjoyed The Cafe really good food, reasonable prices and casual relaxed atmosphere. We spent most days by the pool, most mornings we were down by 9am so didn't have any trouble finding sunbeds, a couple of days whilst we were there the pool got extremely busy and people did struggle to find sunbeds. We loved this hotel and would recommend."

When we arrived we went into the lobby and checked in. There were a bunch of check-in workers there where each line was full. The amount of staff checking people in was adequate and the lines to check in didn't take too long. My room was on the 22nd floor. The room in general wasn't as nice as I expected. I had a view of the pool which was nice. The room was clean (not spotless) and I thought the beds weren't that comfortable. All in all it was a pretty average room with nothing over the top and nothing really to complain about. The refrigerator inside the room was overpriced as to be expected but you need to be careful not to touch anything or else you'll get charged. I would have given this an above average rating if it wasn't for the elevators. At times it would take about 30 minutes to get to my room from the elevator. I recommend staying on the lower levels or the premium levels to avoid this mess. At times there were only 3 elevators working which means close to a 20 minute wait just to step into the elevator. Once an elevator door opens you need to run into it before it gets full. The pools are definitely the draw to this hotel. They are fun and refreshing."

    "content": "First trip to Las Vegas and took the family to see what Las Vegas is all about. Chose Mandalay Bay because of the pools (kids 8 & 12). First of all, the resort is large, covers alot of ground. Our plane arrived in LAS at 9, so we had to wait until about 2 for a room with 2 queens to open up (room requests are NOT guarenteed!), since we were so early, the desk person tried to accomodate us with a King room with cots for the kids and food comp. Thanks, but we'll wait - we checked our bags with the bellman and checked out the sights and ate until I called in to check on our room (It opened up at 2 - we were at the Venetian on a gondola ride) - so we got what we requested. Overall the hotel was nice and clean - the bathroom, while large, echoes like you wouldn't believe - no exhaust fan in the bathroom either - if you know what I mean. The cleaning people could of used the vacuum alittle more in the corners of the room, but all in all, nice place. We faced the strip with the airport to the right - no noise from the airport that affected us. The walls may be alittle thin, as I guess our neighbors would come back to their room late and blast the TV for awhile - not good with younger kids. Pools - pools are nice, but VERY crowded, and the cement is VERY hot. Your best bet is the pool on the right side (east lagoon?). Quieter, and in the afternoon, gets alittle shade from the palm trees and wall. The wave pool and river are crowded as all get out and chairs are bunched together you cannot walk. Finding an open chair to serve as home base is a chore, but do-able. No problem with the elevators - we were on the 11th floor, and almost never had to wait. The only gripe(s) I have are the resort fee - for what???? - no paper at our door, and what else is this for? - the pool??? Also, we used their internet kiosk to check-in for our flight home - there is no schedule for what things cost - like printing boarding passes........ If I didn't happen to see that it cost $1.50 A SHEET in the print header on the screen, I still wouldn't know why all my boarding passes didn't print - caused my daughter alittle anxiety because it was hers that didn't print and was worried she would be left behind (even though we told her we were all checked in and would print them at the airport). Come on............. even in NYC this was complimentary!!! Other than that - good stay once got situtated - another thing - we are all walkers, like to walk - but things in Vegas that look just up the street, can be far away, and the way the sidewalks and such are in Vegas, most of the time, you cannot get there in a straight line. Buy water from either street vendors or at little shops - Casinos sting you 3 fold what it costs at these stores. All in all - good stay, get alittle taste of Las Vegas - the Casino innards (stores, restaurants, and layout are awe inspiring - NY-NY, Paris, and the Venatian were our faves). Probably won't be back - Las Vegas just isn't our cup tea Oh - one last thing - we had the queen beds - now I'm a Super Firm mattress guy - these beds are quite soft, and the pillows are down - didn't sleep as well as I could of."

Even the bathroom was spacious and of much higher quality (double sinks, separate shower stall and bath tub, lcd tv) than some more \"higher-end\" rooms I've stayed in previously. But where I believe the Mandalay Bay shines brightest is at the pool areas. The artificial beach is the best spot to relax and recover during the daytime after (or before) a night out on the strip. Just make sure you get out early in the morning since the beach chairs always seem to fill up extremely quickly. But the one thing that prevents me from giving 5 stars is location. The Mandalay is at the very end of the strip so unless you rent a car or take a cab it's a good 10-15 minute walk to get into the middle of strip. Otherwise, I had an awesome 1st Vegas experience and much of it had to do with the great time I had staying at the Mandalay Bay. Wouldn't hesitate to book here again or to recommend this hotel to friends."

    "content": "Our family enjoyed the stay at the Mandalay Bay. I classify this hotel to be one of the more family friendly on the strip. It also seemed less crowded than some of the other hotels. We had our 9 and 13 year children with us and felt safe when walking through the casino. The rest of the resort including restaurant areas are very nice. The elevator waits mentioned in other reviews were true for us but only at times. A majority of the time we did not wait long but there were a few times the waits were pretty bad. The rooms are spacious and clean. The beds are comfortable. We checked for bed bugs and found none. The carpets, however, are in desperate need of a cleaning particularly in the hallways. Our room was on the 21st floor and faced the pool. The pool closes at 7 so facing the pool was not a problem for us in terms of noise. What was more difficult to deal with was the airport noise. We were right in view of the runway and heard planes taking off at all hours including the middle of the night. It died down some but not completely. I often slept right through as did my family but for the very sensitive sleeper who needs it quiet, this may not be the side you want to face. The wave pool is the reason we decided to stay at this hotel. Unfortunately, we were just a little disappointed with it. We are spoiled with wave pools that normally give off waves for some period of time and then die down. This pool instead allows for one medium size wave every 2 minutes and that's it. The wave is the same every time! You also have to move far into the pool to wait for the wave. You are not permitted to swim around the entrance to the pool where the wave crashes. You can ride the wave in which will take you to the front of the pool but then you must immediately return back into the pool. I'm not sure why this is but I'm thinking there is some kind of safety issue. The lazy river is very nice but you have to rent or buy a tube! The whole pool area is lovely with sand as an added touch. The number of lounge chairs is numerous but they are set right next to the other so that you can't walk between them easily. During the heat of the day the pool was crowded but we went about 5 or 6 which was a great time. Many people had left for the day which made it easy to find available chairs. All in all the staff was great and pool area was pretty high class. It was just the wave pool my kids became a little bored with after a few waves. Overall the resort is a nice place to stay if you can deal with it being at the end of the strip. We liked it that way because it was quieter. It isn't far at all from the Luxor, Excalibur and the New New York resort. We would make it to the MGM resort in about 15 minutes using the tram and then only walking a short way. The M&M store is a short walk right outside the MGM. There was a lot to do in just these hotels so the Mandalay Bay is not really in a bad location. To get to the middle and far end of the strip takes quite a bit of walking so we used taxis for the days we wanted to go a bit further. On last mention about the staff. They were all very accommodating. In fact most staff we encountered at all the resorts were very nice and helpful."

On Sunday morning we went out at 8 am and it was evident the crowds had taken their toll. Chairs and surrounding area not quite as clean as I would have preferred, They no longer rent the tubes for the lazy river, you have to buy at around $25 or bring your own. Ground and sand VERY hot, make sure you wear your beach shoes for even a short hop (funny to watch those who did not). Casino is very large so there is always plenty of room and the air quality better than others I have been in. Excellent service form the staff, from front desk, to housekeeping to pool side service.

I like Mandalay best in the pool months as they have a very hip fun pool scene at Moorea Beach Club. Beware though, the cover for men is generally $50 (women generally $20). They also have concerts on a stage in the water at the neighboring larger family pool in the summer. You can stand in the shallow water of the pool to enjoy the concerts if you choose. Mandalay also has a cool House Of Blues complete with full restaurant and concert venue. Mandalay is one of my Vegas favorites, not cheap, but worth it."

It was large and clean. The view of the strip was spectacular. The hotel was close enough to the airport to hit with a stone. It was at the end of the strip, which was good and bad. It wasd far enough out of the way to be a little more \"quiet\" than the other casinos, but any and everyplace was a bit of a walk. The pools were beautiful. It was filled with good restarants and shops. My one complaint was the elevator. We were on the 22nd floor. The stairs were really not an option. We frequently had to wait in lines at the elevator, up and down. It got so bad we had to show are room keys even to get in line. It was an annoying distraction from an otherwise perfect stay."

The best food is at the House of Blues or StripSteak. As any hotel make sure you don't get one of the adjoining rooms b/c you will hear everything going on in that room. Don't miss the view from the roof at the Foundation Room (best view in Vegas). The BIG Wheel of Fortune game that has a real wheel is worth checking out Not the best gym as all they have is a cardio center, but hey its Vegas are you really going to workout?"

    "content": "We stayed at MB with our two children (8 & 10) for two nights on July5 (Tues/Wed). This is our second time at MB as a family, the first being last Nov. (when most of their pools are closed). On arrival, valet service was quick friendly, even with many people checking in. Check in was somewhat slow, but it seemed to be due to tremendous amount of questions/issues from people checking in ahead of us, not due to lack of speed or persons behind the desk, all of which I saw were friendly and professional. I also noticed several guests unfamiliar with the \u201cresort fee\u201d MB charges on top of the room fee. I do not like it either, folks, but it is clear in the reservation, so if you don\u2019t like it, please stay somewhere else, and don\u2019t waste everyone\u2019s time arguing with the girl checking you in. We requested two queen beds\u2014this is not guaranteed when you reserve, and we did get \u201cone of the last ones.\u201d The room was fine with two exceptions: 1) the interior of the window had fingerprints and forehead prints all over it from the previous guests which I wiped off with a wet towel, 2) the back of the toilet was not clean, but not worth hassle of calling someone about, so I wiped it myself. Our stay last fall did not have these issues. Room was clean and quiet otherwise. The pool was the highlight. Hours vary during the year, but it was open from 8am to 7pm during our stay. People line up at 7:30am to get in. We showed up around 9-9:30 and got one of the last chairs on the sand. The place really started to fill up around noon. Tons of children and families. By afternoon the wave pool is elbow to elbow\u2026.mostly because you have to be up by the blue line in the middle of the pool before the wave comes (one wave comes about every minute and the kids ride the wave on their stomach as it comes ashore\u2014the pool floor is smooth. Once the wave is over, you must go back to the \u201cblue line\u201d which is where the water is about 3ft deep, before the next wave comes. The lifeguards will yell and herd kids up to the blue line all day\u2014presumably so no one gets rolled over when a wave full of humanity comes to shore). Lifeguards were plentiful and attentive. The area was clean, but crowded. The other pools have mostly adults in them and were not crowded. Lazy river is pretty standard but has a very good current and a waterfall. Bring your own tube or get one at a local Walgreens or Wal-Mart for $5. I was shocked at how many people bought tubes on site for nearly $20. The tube shack by the lazy river will inflate yours for free. The lazy river also gets very full, but it was not unbearable. I would imagine on weekends or holidays is crazy. I would also say the same for the elevators. We rarely had to wait for an elevator while we were there, but use common sense\u2026.we intentionally left the pool before closing to avoid the rush of hundreds of pool people for the elevators. There are no restaurants for kids at MB\u2014they appear to be much more adult & high clas$. Take the tram to Luxor (McDonalds, Nathans, Little Caesars) or Excalibur for kids food & affordability. Essentially we stayed at MB for the pool and the nice room for a great price. I also like that there is a nice, large, serene lobby area away from the casino, with room to maneuver or wait around in a low stress environment, unlike some other strip resorts where the lobby is the casino and there are slot machines and people everywhere. MB has been good for family vacations for us. We did not eat there ($$$$) nor go to the shows, which I have heard are good (Lion King & Shark Aquarium) but bring your wallet for that. MB is far from the strip, but if you have a car and want to explore other areas, it is a nice base location to start from with little traffic. If you want to do things away from the strip (with a car), try Red Rock Canyon or Mt Charlston area (no cost), check out the Botanical Cactus Gardens by the Ethel M Factory (also FREE), or the Lied Children\u2019s museum downtown (best for kids 10 or younger). Hoover Dam is always good also (GO EARLY). On this trip we left Las Vegas for Death Valley and then to Yosemite. Everything in Las Vegas was much more crowded in the summer than the fall, be it at the hotel or on the strip itself. Consider an offseason trip to avoid the crowds, but call to check when the wave pool and lazy river close for the season if you are counting on them as part of your trip."

Our room was spacious with a beautiful bathroom! The pool was open and it was quite hot most of the day. The pool has a sandy beach with lots of lounge chairs. There are waitresses to take drink orders, as well as an outdoor grill. The casino has many restaurants, my favourite being the House of Blues. The casino floor is huge, as to be expected. The Mandalay is connect to the Luxor via a covered walkway that has many restaurants and shops along the way. I definitely would recommend a stay at the Mandalay Bay, and will probably stay there again."

    "content": "I have stayed at the Mandalay Bay every summer since it opened. The main reason I have brought the family there each year is the pool area. I've been a big supporter of the hotel all these years, but I have finally had it. The crowding at the pool and the lack of management response to improving it makes me advise against staying there. If you do not get to the pool by 9 or 9:30, forget it, there will be no chairs left. This visit, I arrived at 10 am to find every chair, and I mean EVERY chair not just good ones, occupied. People were having to sit against walls, etc. Worse, the hotel, in an incredibly mendacious move, capitalizes on the very shortage they created, by offering reserved chairs for $50 a day (can go up to $100 a day). Of course, these reserved chairs also take away from the space and supply of free chairs. This situation has existed in one form or another since they added 1000 rooms in The Hotel without really expanding the pool area (except one pool way off the beaten path). Progressively it has gotten worse, until this year it was just out of control. The rooms at the hotel are nice and the restaurants and casino very good, but the pool situation is just disgraceful. Sometimes the elevator wait can be bad too. THIS WAS ON A WEEKDAY, NOT WEEKEND!! If you have any interest in using the pool, I heavily advise you stay somewhere else. In winter, when you wouldn't be swimming anyway, fine. I think this is the first negative review of many I have every written on Trip Advisor, so I don't do it lightly. But, people need to know."

    "content": "In hindsight, I wish I researched this before booking. As things turned out, my bad experience is NOT an isolated incident with this business. Many of our family members booked a mini family vacation here for a July weekend several months in advance DIRECTLY from their web site. After getting a confirmation and putting down a deposit($230/night) for our reservation, we thought that everything was set. What else could go wrong? When we arrived around 3pm check in time after tired 9hr drive. My heart sank after they informed me that we no longer have a room because they were overbooked(was a busy weekend, boxing event). Now why on earth would you continue to book people for the hotel rooms when you know you ran out of rooms!!! Isn't it suppose to be first come first serve? When you don't have enough rooms to rent out for a particular day, aren't you suppose to stop booking more people! As I later learned, we weren't the only people that have this problem on that day. I overhear many other guests that were just as pee off as we were after getting bump from the hotel. After pleading for them to provide us a room(didn't care if its down or up scale) so we can stay with the family without staying 3 miles away from the stip, they still wouldn't give us our room. All they told us was that they were sold out and the typical customer service talk. The only thing they did was give us some taxi money and transferred our stay to their sister hotel Mirage(also owned by MGM) for a complimentary stay and refunded us the deposit. In hindsight, when I looked back, I suspect that they bumped us because there were more people willing to pay for a higher rate that busy weekend. So obviously if they pay more, that'd be more $$ for the hotel. Just weeks before I went, I often checked the price of the rooms and noticed that the rate gone up by 50%+. So it sounds to me that the highest bidder wins. What ever happen to business integrity? Back in the days when you get a confirmation after making a deposit, its pretty much a done deal that you'll get your room. If you don't mind taking a gamble, book this place at your own risk because a confirmation of reservation is meaningless at this place. In the future, I'll have 2nd thought about staying at any MGM properties. Definitely Mandalay Bay is no longer a place I'd stay."

We had troubles with checking-in because our reservation didn\u2019t come through but the receptionist and many people behind were busy searching for it and finally found our already paid reservation. Our room was on the 24th floor, elevator was fast, the room big with two double beds, huge flat screen and mini bar with a sensor, so cannot take out anything without getting charged. It was well designed and the beds were comfortable. To our disappointment, the room was not clean, we found several hairs and this makes the reduction to 4 points. The buffet breakfast was tasty but rolls or good bread was missing. Shark Reef is interesting but way too expensive. Self parking is a bit tricky to find when you haven\u2019t been here before.

There is a lot to see here so looking over the floor plan is a must to get the best out of your stay or you will be walking all over the place. For those with young kids the wading pool next to the wave pool is great. For all others the wave pool is fun and offers a cook retreat from the hot sun. The staff is constantly walking around to serve great beverages so you can sit and relax. The bar is close so if you need to get out of the sun you can. Note: if you want seats on the beach you should leave your room no later than 9-10am otherwise it will be difficult especially if you have a family. We didn't get a chance to do the lazy river but it looked fun. Again time is everything, at noon it was packed. Gambling, if thats your vice was fun. The tables were well managed and slots everywhere. The restaurants were equally amazing. The food, well prepared with pleasant staff and atmosphere. Check out \"The Cafe\" for breakfast, \"Strip Steak\" for dinner. The room was clean and amazing! We stayed in a spa suite and very glad we did. The bed provided a great night rest. The room spacious and well designed. As far as money goes... well your in Vegas so not much is cheap unless you can carry your vacation on your lucky winnings. Drinks and food are pricy but well worth it. If your on a budget look for restaurant.com coupons which helped take a chunk out of the high pricing. If you plan accordingly you can have a great vacation at Mandalay. Good Luck!!"

The food, service, amenities, shows, pool activities were always amazing and relatively easy to get to. Our kids loved bouncing between the lazy river, the wave pool and periodically going to the 'normal' pool. The hotel rooms are very spacious which is great traveling with a family. We saw The Lion King while we were there which was a highlight. We left the hotel once to take a taxi to Target and get a few items we left behind. If you do this I recommend bringing back a case of water since I paid $20 for three waters by the pool but had to as it was 105 outside. The tram from Mandalay Bay was great to get you closer to the strip if you do want to leavel"

Bathroom was nice and clean and everything worked, comfortable bed. Had some problems with wireless on the laptop, worked with the ipod but had to hook up to the internet line for laptop. Dinner at Bayside Buffet wasnt that great for kids. Food wasnt very temperature hot and there was hardly any vegetarian choices. Dessert buffet was the best part. Dined at the buffet again at breakfast and it was the best breakfast buffet we have ever been to. lots and lots of choices, even some dinner selections too. Pool was clean and didnt get overcrowded until about noon. Read reviews about getting a chair, so we were down at the pool every morning before they opened at 730 am. Sat in a different spot each day. it was nice and clean and I didnt see any trash in any of the pool areas. Wave pool was nice but the waves were set very far apart so it wasnt as enjoyable for the kids as I had hoped. Drinks were WAY overpriced. $14 for a frozen 16 oz drink seemed a bit pricey. And the pool closes at 7 pm every night which is a HUGE disappointment and the poolside bar stops serving at 630 :( That was my only complaint. Read other reviews about the snacks that are in the room, yes they are on a weighted display, however my kids touched them and we didnt receive a random charge at the end of our stay. Never had to wait for the elevator one time during our stay. Room was cleaned every day and everything was perfect as far as cleanliness goes. There wasnt a coffee maker in the room and couldnt find anywhere to get a cup until 5 am. The hotel grounds were beautiful, front desk was helpful and prompt with check in and check out. There was a $20 day resort fee that included use of pool, wireless and free newspaper (i never did see a paper) and that fee was due at check in. LOTS of families at the hotel, didnt see anything in appropriate and we will def be returning as a family. There was alot of walking and we did splurge on cab fare a few times, but it was worth it. great hotel! :)"

I actually only received towels the next day and this was after 3 or 4 complaints and multiple requests to speak to a Manager (never happened). In fairness, I was there on business so didn't get to use any of the leisure facilities, but based on my current experience, I'd be unlikely to book personally into this hotel."

    "content": "We have stayed at Mandalay Bay in the past and have had no problems - at that time they would have gotten 4 stars - not any more. This was by far the worst hotel stay I have experienced in a long time. First, we arrived at the valet area to be greeted with \"We're Full - you'll need to self park\". When we notified them that we were checking in, were were told that it would be a few minutes. It took over 1/2 hour to get the valet to take the car. Then there were the elevators: we almost never saw anyone use the bank for the lower level floors, but for floors 18-34, there was always a HUGE line, 3 times in a 48 hour period, we waited over 1/2 hour for an elevator. Twice while I was on it, the elevator got stuck between floors and 2 of the elevators in that bank made a horrible screeching sound each time the doors opened. The buffet has gone horribly downhill - there is not enough staff to service the number of guests and, therefore, always huge waits and the quality of the food is much lower than in past visits. We mentioned this to our server and he said he had heard these complaints many times recently. Beyond these issues, there was trash, an old mini-fridge and several room service trays left in the hallway for more than 12 hours on our floor. The room - clean and comfortable with a nice bed and large soaking tub. The wifi is included in the resort fee you are charged. The Pool/ cabana staff - we rented a cabana for the day and the staff was very accommodating and pleasant, service was great and the pool area was very well maintained. The Mandalay Bay needs to hire more staff and address these issues, or there are many (newer) properties up the Strip happy to accommodate."

    "content": "We came to Mandalay bay to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. We had a lovely time and enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The room was spacious and clean and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was great with a jacuzzi tub, shower and double sinks. There is no fridge in the room- the mini bar is sensor activated so removing any of the items will incur a charge on your bill. ( I normally unload the fridge and use it to keep my own drinks/snacks cold) The downside was that the rooms were not soundproof- people talking in the halls sounded like the door to your room was open. We stayed on the 7th floor and never had to wait for an elevator. The elevators to floors 17 and higher often had long line ups to get in. The resort charges a $20/day fee that includes wifi, free local calls, daily newspaper, and access to the cardio room. The cardio room is a small room with cardio equipment- not the full gym that you have access to if you buy a spa pass. A spa day pass gives you access to a full gym with lots of machines, cardio equipment, and free weights, as well as access to the spa pools, locker room, showers and lounge areas. The pass is $25/day or you can buy a three day pass for $60.00. We enjoyed the landshark lagoon- it was a quieter pool. The beach/wave pool and lazy river were much busier and louder. I would suggest bringing your own tubes for the lazy river as the ones for sale on the property were expensive. For shopping off the strip you can catch a bus ( stop just outside of the hotel) A day pass is $7.00. We shopped at Town square- it is a unique mall with a \"village\" atmosphere and lots of stores. The next stop after Town square is the outlet mall. The bus is also a great way to get to places further down the strip. Buses come by every 10-15minutes."

The floors shone, the ambiance was subdued the wave pool was just what the doctor ordered and the lazy river was relaxing and fun. Last time we were here we didn't rent an inner tube so this time when we went to find the rental location we found that they only sell them now thanks to previous guests walking off with them. A little pricey ($20 something) per inner tube, but what in Las Vegas is not? We selected a regular room, non smoking & king bed. The room was subdued and relaxing but the view out the window on the 4th floor was of the AC units. Horrible view. I guess one has to pay extra to guarantee a reasonable room if I understand their policy correctly. Absolutely hated the view and the noise from the AC units. The bed was luxuriously comfortable and we fell right to sleep. On our 2nd night there we put out the Do Not Disturb sign, actually, it had been out the whole day and I left my purse on the bed while we went out to dinner. When we got back we noticed the Do Not Disturb sign had been returned to the INSIDE of the door and our bed had been made. I immediately phoned Housekeeping and reported the problem and when I asked if the sign meant for hotel people to stay out of the room I was told yes, that's just what it means. They refunded our least expensive day + taxes and we can only hope that nothing strange turns up on our credit card or debit card which were in my purse. We think of the Mandalay Bay as a high end hotel, but with staff that enter rooms without permission, we're beginning to re-think the quality of this lovely resort. The rest of the staff were top notch, the room ambience was excellent, the water features out of this world but we would recommend two things if you are going to stay here: 1. Assume the housekeeping staff cannot read English. Take your valuables with you every time you leave the room. 2. Complain to management if you have ANY problems. They need to know the quality of service they are providing and unless you tell them, they'll never know. OK, 3 things. Call ahead if you can for Valet to go get your vehicle before you get downstairs. I don't know if they allow that, but it will certainly save you 10-15 minutes of waiting in the heat."

Previous to this stay, we stood at the MGM Grand. These are my reasons for never coming back to the Mandalay Bay, first, we realized that the Mandalay Bay was the furthest hotel on our end of the strip, but didn\u2019t really realize it until we stood there. That wouldn\u2019t have been totally bad except for the fact that the tram that runs from Mandalay to Luxor and Excalibur closes way too early, even on the weekends. So you\u2019re stuck walking all the way back. The alternative would be to flag a cab like in any metro city, but alas, you can\u2019t hail cabs in Las Vegas, you have to take the long walk to the entrance of the nearest hotel. I can honestly say in the previous eight times I have visited Vegas, I have never stayed in a room where my room shook when someone either next door or even across the hall slams their door, which happened often and unfortunately too early in the morning. Now, let\u2019s talk about the elevator situation, which from the reviews I have read seem to be the most common complaint. You have all these floors in the hotel and one elevator bank to accommodate them. The elevator bank was always crowded. You have to fight to get one. If you were lucky enough to finally get in one, it would have been almost to weight capacity or you were being pushed by someone\u2019s pool float or their suitcase. Here\u2019s the most ridiculous charge the hotel had, a resort fee. We were charged $20 essentially for the USA Today paper, because that\u2019s the only thing we took advantage of. We didn\u2019t use the In-room Wireless Internet; didn\u2019t use the Cardio Room; had our cell phones so local and 800 calls were not made on the hotel\u2019s phone; and lastly did not use the Business Center. Even after this visit, I still love Vegas, but not at the Mandalay Bay. So I\u2019m sorry MGM Grand, I will never stray from you again."

I would have to say that the main problem with this hotel is the elevators. Something needs to be done about the lineups. With the number of elevators in use it just seems wrong that there wasn't enough service to upper floors. The front desk receptionist that I spoke to was miserable and unfriendly. She showed no enthusiasm whatsoever about explaining the check in process. The rooms were fine - AC was fine - TV was fine. Wireless internet was very slow and would disconnect often - made it very hard to check email with my phone. The bathroom drains smelled like sulfur and we had some loud bubbling backup sounds waking us up in the middle of the night. There's no fan in the bathroom either, although the toilet flushes like you're on an airplane. The closet doors and the doors that separate the main room from the bathroom are very loud to open and close - a poor design in my opinion. The latches are above the doors toward the ceiling and half the time you're not sure whether you're supposed to push or pull. That might get noisy with kids. The wave pool was fun but small and very crowded. I thought having a sand beach would be cool but it wasn't because it's completely filled with beach chairs - overcrowded to say the least - and no umbrellas unless you pay extra for VIP service. The pool was okay. The \"river\" was okay too - again just too overcrowded. The casino was just like any other but like I said it was my first time in Vegas. They all looked the same to me. I loved the China Grill restaurant - highly recommend that place - food was amazing. Plus I was a big fan of Yogurt In - the yogurt was incredible - actual frozen yogurt, it was a first. When I go back to Vegas I'm definitely going to try a different hotel."

Do people really enjoy a disgustingly overcrowded pool complex, queuing for an elevator, queuing for very poor and very overpriced food, queuing at check in, queuing for (Valet) Parking and being miles away from everything other than the airport. Ok the Luxor and Excalibur Hotels are right next door, but for someone who is not particularly fond on what Mandalay Bay has to offer, these other two places appear to be even worse. If you want the opportunity to cool down in a pool in Vegas, try the Motel 8 across the street. There seemed to be no queues and you could actually see the water... there were even umbrellas and lounging chairs. You pay a 20 something dollar resort fee which gets you pool access ( but not necessarily and place in the pool), a newspaper (apparently, though I could not find it) and access to the most depressing cardio equipment room I have seen in ages. Beware....access to the gym is separate. The hotel threw in a whole-day buffet for two. We did not bother with breakfast or lunch as we prefer to get both before the day is over and with this queues that was a bit of a challenge. We tried it once for dinner. You can compare it to motorway diner quality. OK it was the 4 July weekend and that does attract a crowd...but full is full and any, even the lowest, sense of quality and hygiene should lead to a management decision not to accept any further reservations. We had a deluxe room with view on the Strip. A niece view, but the windows could do with some cleaning. We also stayed at the Bellagio this trip, but figured that a couple of days at Mandalay Bays pools would be nice... how wrong could we be. I have also stayed at the Venetian two years ago, which was great. If ever I have to go back to Vegas, I'll be very selective on hotels, but with these prices you may as well fly to the real Venice or Paris. Las Vegas has its attractions and its reasons to stay away from it. Mandalay Bay is definitely in the second category for anyone who maintains any standards when it comes to holidaying."

The faucets in our room had yellow mildew rings around them, the shower door was missing a big strip of caulk, our duvets had black stains on them and best of all, the ceiling in the bathroom had Jagermeister labels plastered on it. Housekeeping took 20 minutes to deliver an additional set of towels. Elevators were horribly overcrowded. Lazy river had tons of trash floating in it and the poor lifeguards spent more time picking up trash than they did watching swimmers. Lion King was great and room service meals were actually fairly good. Casino was packed with 20-something tattooed Girls Gone Wild and guys with gold necklaces and bling. We ended up taking $20 taxi rides to the Venetian to escape. No comparison between the two and no reason to suffer at the Mandalay Bay. Great brunch at Bouchon and entertaining version of Phantom. Lupo and many of the other restaurants at Mandalay Bay closed at 10pm which we didn't expect in Vegas. Don't waste your vacation dollars here unless you are there with your kids and they just have to have the wave pool. Even then, be prepared to get their early to save a lawn chair and spend part of your day fishing empty beer containers out of the pool. Forgot to mention lovely false fire alarm at 2:30am on first night of our stay because someone was supposedly smoking near the smoke detector and the altercation one of our neighbors had with a call girl who thought she'd been invited back to his room. There's also a lot of airport noise. I never received the email copy of our bill from self-checkout even though we stayed there almost one month ago. I really, really disliked this place and would not stay here again even if someone offered me a room for free."

Housekeeping is good, we have never had a problem. The beds are not super comfy, but good enough. There always seems to be big lines on check in, but everyone stands in the closest lines. We saw a huge crowd when we walked up, but we went to the clerks way at the end and just walked right to the desk. No one was waiting there at all. We stayed in a deluxe room with an amazing view straight down the strip. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. :) The only issue seems to be with the elevators. Sometimes they are very crowded and you have to wait for one that is not extremely full. And of course there are those rude people that get in anyway when the elevator is full and then the alarm goes off because the weight limit has been exceeded. Those are the same ones that get in when you are going up, but they want to go down - and they won't let you out at your floor. We were squished frequently into the back of the elevator by people complaining they were going up when they wanted to go down. Seems a lot of tourists have trouble understanding the difference between up and down when they see an elevator arrive. We stayed over July 4th weekend so it was quite busy, but last time we stayed mid week in August and had the same problem with the elevators."

Before we even got to the hotel, I knew our stay was going to be bad, but since several of us were already booked here we couldn't change hotels. Long story short, before we arrived the hotel cancelled our reservation because of a miscommunication about the deposit. The hotel ended up upgrading us to the \"spa suite\" before our arrival because my Husband complained about the service he recieved from their call center when trying to fix our reservation (the call center manager told him that \"if he can't afford an additional $200, maybe he shouldn't stay at their hotel\"- OMG). Anyways, upon our arrival the hotel receptionist was a B****. They scewed up the name on our reservation so they wouldn't let me check in without approval from my Husband. It was like fort knox in there. Not to mention she just had a POOR attitude. Once we finally got to our room, which took forever because the elevator system sucks, the \"suite\" had stains on the bed and couch so we requested a new room. The new room was in another building, so 20 minutes later after 2 more elevator rides we arrived in a NON-smoking room that stunk like smoke. After complaining a 3rd time we got a new room, not a suite in the OTHER building again- it did have a good view of the strip, but that was about it. The rooms are ok, nothing special. They are cramped and not worth the price. The service here sucks. The staff seems to hate thier jobs and they do NOTHING to acommodate the customer. The elevator situation was a point of contention all weekend and resulted in much annoyance. I will NOT be back to Mandalay Bay- even if it was free. I also don't think I will stay at any MGM property going foward. It's just not worth the headache when there are so many other great places to stay in Vegas."

    "content": "I'll admit, I don't really get Vegas. For a vacation from my stressful life, why would I want to be trapped in a hermetically sealed building in the middle of the desert, with only the prospect of losing my money at cards to distract me? Why do this? But for various work reasons I've been to the Mandalay three times this year, so I figured I could write a review from the Vegas-skeptic perspective. First of all, Mandalay's location at the south end of the Strip is a plus and a minus. It's a little more calm, outside the insanity of the central Strip, but miles from any attractions or restaurants. If there weren't fences or security you could absolutely walk to the airport terminal (although of course, this being Vegas, a cab must go all the way around it and costs $20). Convenient but south side rooms are subjected to the non-stop roar of jets taking off from 5am to 1am -- as is the pool area, more on that later. Rooms are probably the best thing about Mandalay--I haven't been paying, but I think they're around $100/night which is pretty good for a great big bed, sitting area, two sinks, huge tub *and* separate shower, separate WC, tasteful decor (unlike the hotel's sickening gold exterior). However room prices in Vegas are wild, going as low as $20 for places like the Stratosphere or Circus Circus, so I'm not sure I know enough to compare. While I'm not a gambler and won't try and review, say, the poker tables, I am an eater and in the restaurant department, Mandalay is good only if you have money to burn. They've sunk millions into \"star\" restaurants with insane prices, like the hilariously named Aereole, but even those feel out of date, '90s boom-era silly theme restaurants like the supposedly Russian Red Square, complete with \"Russian nachos\" on the menu. Uh-huh. As a San Franciscan, I feel like you can get a meal as good as Aereole (and less pretentious) at any corner bistro for a quarter of the price, so I just don't really get the point of it. And if you aren't interested in a Meal-As-Show Price-Is-No-Object Experience, you're out of luck. There's little that's \"mid-range,\" except a sort of American-themed \"Red White and Blue\" restaurant that's like a bad diner at prices that make you think the food is being shipped to the moon. The sushi bar is adjacent to the cover-band lounge, so you can be treated to deafening covers of \"867-5309\" while you get some stale, overpriced fish. The adjacent \"mall\" that leads to Luxor features two mid-range restaurants that are absolutely abysmal, a trashy Mexican joint that's like a Chevy's run by zombies, and an Irish pub that feels like work release for its Irish staff. The line for the Starbucks is often 40 people long, and the prices there are about 50% higher than I've seen anywhere. If you decide you're fed up with your dining options, a cab to another restaurant will be $20 each way, so, factor that into your meal costs. Honestly, on multiple occasions I've hopped on the Strip Express bus ($5 for a 2 hour window of rides) one stop south to the \"Town Square\" mall and had a great meal at the Whole Foods. Vegetables! The other thing that seems like it's just par for the course in Vegas but baffling to me is the size of the resorts. For a car-dependent city, I feel like i walk hundreds of miles whenever I'm here. Everything's a trek. To get to the pool area, you have to go past another hotel's pool (the Four Seasons', natch), and through a security barrier. This is of course if you make it there before the pool area's 7PM closing time. The pool area itself is elaborate and insane, with a massive wave pool filled with stationary swimmers bobbing in the intermittent waves, an anxiety-inducing system of pool chair heirarchies, and music blasting at an ear-shattering level, but still not loud enough to cover up the roar of jets every 60 seconds and the machine-gun staccato of helicopters which swoop to their next-door landing area almost as often. It's comedically irritating, probably the least relaxing pool area in the entire world, and I wonder what it must be like for the unsuspecting Midwestern families who planned their vacations around it. I haven't experienced any of the Mandalay's 3 nightclub spots but they appear to be not that bad, with genuine artists booked at House of Blues and the rooftop lounge decorated about as tastefully as Vegas gets. So, there's that. There's a gym which is pretty well-equipped, but that's gonna cost you -- my 3-day pass was 65 freakin dollars, twice my *monthly* gym fee at home. And that my friends does *not* include the spa with its bubbling tubs, steam room and robed overweight guys lounging around (I peeked inside). Wi-fi is ridiculously unreliable, which is a problem, since the building is basically a gargantuan bunker that blocks cell phone reception. However the $20/day \"resort fee\" that supposedly includes the service is, of course, mandatory. Ultimately, Mandalay seems made only for conferences at the attached convention center; for any other traveler, there is likely somewhere on the strip that does what you want better. You've got good rooms here, but everything else is wildly expensive nickel-and-diming, built for expense accounts, not wallets. Neither families nor partiers will enjoy the pool scene, and foodies will feel frustrated. But what do I know, since Vegas is, for me, second only to Dubai on the list of \"Places That Just Make No Sense To Me At All.\""

Made reservations way back in March and even referred all of our family which in total we reserved 4 rooms. we were supposed to get the complimentary upgrade to 750 GR with $18 resort fee & 2 complimentary drinks. Well, none of those were honored. When we were checking in, we were told that there was no 750Gr room available and we can either be \"upgraded\" but at The Hotel or wait for at least 3 hours to get the room we reserved or downgrade. This is what we get for reserving early. Btw, my sister who also checked in earlier also was told that there were no rooms available but when she started yelling, Whola! there was a room avaialble! I guess they gave away all of the rooms to people w/o reservations but were wiling to pay 3x what we paid and just deal with us who made reservations later on. As we chose to downgrade, we were told that we'll be given a $100 credit for food and beverage. When we went to our room and the key did not work, my husband went to the lobby to ask for another key and asked about the $100 credit. To our surprise (or should I say not to our surprise) the lady told us there was nothing noted to our reservation about the credit. The resort fee charged was $22.00+ as opposed to the $18 that was on the confirmation. The 2 complimentary drinks were not given. Asked for a shower cap in the morning but housekeeping never came. Internet was slow. Very very terrible stay. Really disappointing. Ruined our family vacation. Was embarrassed to have referred them to others and will never again."

    "content": "We reserved a view room and that's what we got (22nd floor with a view of the strip). The positives of this hotel are room size with great bathrooms, comfortable beds, floor to ceiling windows, large plasma TV, and even a TV in the bathroom. They maybe tried to pack too much furniture into the room for the size though. The pool complex with beach, wave pool, lazy river and 3 other pools was very nice, but VERY crowded, and it didn't matter what time of day you went. Only found two chairs at the regular pools once because they never clean off the towels left behind and never saw any wait staff. There is an isolated pool (south lagoon) where you could get a chair, or you could rent a reserved chair at the beach for $50! My wife and I did however discover their over 21 \"European style\" adult pool \"Moorea Beach Club\". It was $10 for ladies and $40 for guys for all day access, and well worth it. Though tops are optional for the ladies, I would say over 80% wore them, and because of the price for guys to get in, there wasn't a lot of creepy types just getting in to stare. Service at this pool was FABULOUS! Full menu, at reasonable prices (for Las Vegas), great drinks, and very attentive staff. They even find you lounge chairs when you enter. Much more economical than a cabana if you don't want the shade and other perks. We also attended 4th of July fireworks and a concert on the beach (Mystic Roots) for $30 and it was a great event and lots of fun. Would definitely recommend hitting one of their concerts on the beach that they seem to hold all summer long. The drawbacks to this hotel are the elevators first and foremost. Even on a weekday they were by far the slowest and most crowded elevators we have experienced at a Las Vegas strip hotel, and we've stayed at some other large hotels. We had to wait 20 minutes for one up to our room when we checked in, and rarely could get on the first one that stopped at our floor or at the lobby. Also found a sock in our room which wasn't ours and had to ask twice for extra pillows. The final drawback is the hotel's location at the end of the strip. If you are coming back to the hotel after 10:30 pm, you have to walk through or past 2 other hotels or take a cab, because the tram between Excalibur and Mandalay Bay is closed. Took a long time to get anywhere from this hotel if you didn't want to take a cab. To sum it up, unless I got a killer deal, I don't think I'd stay here again. Mostly because of the location and the elevators. There are just too many other options out there and we prefer the Mirage and MGM."

    "content": "We decided to go to Mandalay Bay because of the pool. We read all about the sand beach, wave pool and lazy river. My wife would not go in the lazy river as it runs way to fast. The pool has about 400 lounges for a hotel that has 3500 rooms. Half of the pools perimeter is unusable due to the wave pool machine, a stage and fake stone scenery.. When we complained about not getting a pool lounge for 3 days in a row we were told to get there earlier. You could also rent a chair from them but after paying top dollar for a room I think that is BS!!! You have to get there by 8:30 at the latest to get a seat. The music they played was mostly unknown and lyrics included sex talk. Occasionally they would throw in a recognizable song, but it was all 80's like John Cougar Mellencamp. They didn't play current music until our last day. We have been to a lot of hotels on the strip, but none this bad. They should have considered the size of their hotel and the fact that the pool is the only thing that sets them apart from the other hotels on the strip when they designed it. Gentlemen can't bring their wives a towel because they only let you have one per person. Also since its so far down the strip you need a rental car to go anywhere, or get a taxi down the strip. Out of their 8 elevators only 4 were working and the lineups and wait time for them was ridiculous. The internet costs of $20.00 a day is quite high but you know they need the money so they can fix the problem of not having water in the morning. (Yep that's right, woke up and there was no running water. That wasted a few hours of our holiday just waiting so we could shower, flush and go for breakfast) Complaints fell on deaf ears. Save your self a lot of disappointment and go to a good hotel with staff that cares. We've never had any problems at the Mirage or the MGM."

One day our room was not serviced so I called in the evening asking for at least more towels and shampoo. Three calls, and an hour and a half later, towels arrived. On the second call I was told that I had already received them. Not so. Check in was slow, check out was good. If you are on any kind of budget, meals are very expensive. Good, but expensive. Drinks, too, are expensive. There is absolutely no shade in most of the pool areas unless you pay hundreds of dollars for a cabana, or pay for lounges and then pay a separate fee for an umbrella which accomodates three people.

    "content": "My sister and I booked two suites at Mandalay Bay from July 4 to July 7. There was a 'suite' deal available in March which got us into a 765 square feet one room suite whose bathroom was larger than most of the European hotel rooms I have stayed in over the past 7 years. We have stayed here before from the first opening week to last year, so we have seen this property slowly evolve over the years. The rooms have lost their sparkle and the property seems a little dated, sort of like imperial Austria before the second war. Nonetheless, we were both impressed with the room details (dual TVs, jacuzzi tub, separate sinks and shower). As stated in earlier reviews, the elevators leading up to our 27th floor room were extremely slow with long lines to boot. Here's a tip: Take the elevator DOWN one floor (to the beach level) and then go up. The elevator will bypass the first (casino level) floor completely. As always, I am opposed to the so-called 'resort' fee, which I see as a way for management to show the room rates as cheaper than other sites during an Internet search. To their credit, Mandalay Bay has stated in some of their web pages that there is a $22.40 daily additional charge for the room. This fee includes their 'cardio' room, (of which 2 of the 3 treadmills and a bicycle were broken), a free newspaper (USA Today only), free local calls (assuming you even know someone in Las Vegas) and a free printout of your boarding pass. Wired or wireless Internet access is included as well (use the wired access if you can; it's considerably faster and probably more secure). They recently discontinued the 2 free 'well' drinks option. This time we skipped the beach area completely. The cabanas we looked at (to avoid staying in the direct sun) were priced at $350-$450 which included 2 inner tubes so we passed on that offer. We bought a three day bus ticket ($20). With the bus stop close by, we took the Duece and Ace (express) bus all along the strip and downtown; quite a positive experience. I strongly recommend this option, which actually puts Mandalay Bay close to the strip action. An overhead tram runs to the Luxor and/or Excalibur as well."

Took our bags up to our room 8 floor. Room was nice and big as was the bathroom. Don\u2019t use the fridge for personal storage. See photo on restocking charge. Nor eat any of the snacks in the room. Very pricey. Coffee is $3.50. Coffee cake is $3.50. So you can easily run up a big bill for breakfast. We ate at the coffee shop on our last morning and had a bill of $22.00 for three people. There is a McDonalds across the street that we had breakfast there most of the time. Exit the hotel out of the doorway for tours and it is a very short walk from there. Beds were very comfortable. Take plenty of clothes with you so you can avoid the laundry service prices. See photo Pool - it is crowded. We went on our first morning there around 0900 and took forever to find a set of chairs. We had to look for someone leaving the pool area to get their chairs. There is really no shade. Umbrellas are $100/day. Cabanas are $650/day. The only shade that we found was over at the lazy river. But, you have to get on line very early. I was there at 0745 (opens at 0800) and already there were 75 people in front of me. Went the next morning at 0740 and only had 40 people in front. What I figured out the final day we were there was there is another entrance to the pool over by the lazy river side. If you go in that entrance, you can get one of the chairs on the wave pool side of the lazy river and have some shade. In the afternoon, you would want the chairs on the other side of the lazy river since that side would be in the shade. Take your own tubes. They will fill them up with air for you. I read that here on Trip advisor. Otherwise, expect to pay $16.00 to $24.00 for tubes. Same ones you can get at local stores for $5-10.00 I would not take a black tube. The sun bakes everything and your tube will be really hot to touch. Ours were light colored and still got hot. The sand area is nice, except when walking on it. You practically burn your feet. We used the tub in our room to hold our tubes when we are not in the pool. They had a concert and fireworks on July 4th at the pool area. According to another guest there, they removed all the chairs from the beach area for the concert. So they did a lot of work into the night to put back all the chairs. Because of the fireworks, the wave pool did not open right way. They were still cleaning it from the debris of the fireworks. There still was some stuff in there. So beware if you go after fireworks. The water is not crystal clear. Being a pool owner, I guess they know nothing about SHOCK. Water in the lazy river is cooler in temperature than wave pool. The lazy river can become just one big mass of people and tubes. You have been warned. :). They play music in the pool area. Water is $5.00. Major rip-off. Service - Housekeeping did a great job with our room. Not sure if she did change the bed on our stay. They did give us fresh towels. There were room service tray/dishes outside our doorway area for three days before they were picked up. The carpets could use a good cleaning. Probably at the beginning of the hotel, they used to do such cleaning on a scheduled basis, but with cutbacks, etc., they cut corners. Location - Located at the South end of the strip. We did the outside walk up the strip until we got wise of the tram service. - Use it. We took the tram all the time up to Excalibur. You can then walk over to New York, New York. Go inside New York, New York and you can head to the elevated walkway to MGM. Purchased a three day pass on the monorail to get us around. But you have to walk through MGM to get to it. Very pretty decor in the hotel. Luxor seems dark to us as did MGM. Very spacious lobby area. Resort fee $22.00 so you can use the Internet and get a free newspaper. Never had to pay a fee at a Hampton Inn before."

A little pricy but it was something different to do. My husband was able to join this trip and he really liked the hotel as well. The food was good at every place that we ate, and the rooms were clean and nice. Went to a show at the House of Blues and that was a good time. Nice venue - small. We had food in private areas catered so we really didn't try any restaurants, other than a breakfast buffet which was typical vegas. Went to New York New York taking the tram to Excalibur... however it wasn't running when we left and it felt like we walked for hours to get back. A little bit off the strip but with the tram it gets you a little closer quick. I would stay here again for business or pleasure."

    "content": "My daughter chose to get married at Mandalay Bay Valley of the Falls. As parents, we decided to book the Vista Suite so family could visit and we would have enough room for an informal get-together after the wedding. First, the lack of communication on the part of the wedding coordinators is appalling. Some friends of ours called to book a room 2 days after the cut-off for the group rate (cutoff is one month and two days before the wedding) and were quoted a room price over double the group quote. Really?? They chose another hotel. We went to check in and were told our room was not ready (no big surprise there) The guy checking us in didn't even ask if we wanted to leave our bags there, fortunately we were in rental car. We were told they would call when our room was ready. Three hours later and no phone call, my husband went to the front desk (and stood in line again) only to be told \"oh yeah, your room is ready\" and was given the keys. As the bellhop was unloading our bags, the Mandalay Bay called my cell phone to tell me our room was ready. The Suite was nice - not enough towels. The view was wonderful. However, even in the pricey suites, they do not provide you bottled water or a coffee maker. You have to buy water from the mini bar at $5.00 a bottle or go downstairs to the newstand store and buy it for $3.00 a bottle. We stayed at Lake Las Vegas our first night and there was a coffee maker, bottled water and an empty refrigerator in our room and it was only $99.00 per night (on the weekend). We will never stay at Mandalay again. We waited forever to be seated for dinner, the prices were high and the food was just so-so. The service in the entire hotel was lousy. Attitudes are bad, service is bad. They just don't care. The only good service was the valet's and the bell hops. We had a large group of family staying at Mandalay for the wedding. This hotel has gotten all of our families money they will ever get. No one who stayed was happy with the experience. The grooms parents actually changed their reservation and stayed at the Luxor. Very dissapointed in Mandalay Bay, especially after how much money we spent there between, staying eating and having a wedding there. The halls smell and are shabby looking as well. I would not reccomend this hotel."

    "content": "We were married at Mandalay Bay on May 14, 2011. For the wedding we reserved a Vista Suite (34135) and the room was amazing. The room was showing a little wear but the view is by far the best draw of the Vista Suites. The room is very large and well appointed. There are 1 and a half bathrooms and they were both very nice. There is a large soaking tub and a steam shower. I really can not complain about the room. The property is spacious and well laid out. We are pretty frequent travelers to Vegas and this hotel by far had the most kids of any we have stayed at. The pool area is very nice and there are several chairs. There are also several paid cabanas. We ended up renting a cabana the day after our wedding so we did not have to deal with the crowds and I would do it again in a heartbeat. There are several dining options in Mandalay Bay and we ate at a few of them. There is a pretty wide variety and a 24 hour place so everyone can find something to eat. The wedding chapel was awesome to work with. We were married at the Valley of the Falls and I could not have asked for a better ceremony. Everything was very professional and run very smoothly. I have zero complaints with them. We had many family members stay at Mandalay Bay and all of them were treated well. The negatives I have are these. The hallways were filthy. Just gross. Someone vomited in the hallway halfway to our room and it was there for two days. The walls are in need of painting and the carpet needs to be changed. The elevators were also horrible. It usually took about 20 minutes to get up tp the 34th floor. Something seriously needs to be done about this. The casino is starting to look very dated. Some of the staff have zero personality, and while I am not expecting the level of service I have received at other 5 star properties in Vegas, a smile would have been nice. Overall, Mandalay Bay is a good mid level property in Vegas. There is much to do here and it is great for families."

There were plenty of restaurants to choose from, although I only grabbed soup from one of the to go counters. It was delicious, although pricey (but what isn't in Vegas). I ordered room service one night (4 pieces of toast for $8) which took way too long to get to me and was burnt. I was too sick and too tired to bother with complaining, but had I been better, I would have been very disappointed. I didn't get to spend much time in the casino, but there seemed to be a decent variety of things to do. I was also told by my coworker that the nightlife was pretty good in the bars."

We arrived early that day before midday, only to be told we were being moved to the MGM GRAND as the Mandaly Bay was overbooked. We were advised that a descision to move people was made 11pm the night before. Needless to say we were not happy, with being moved and being moved to a down grade at the MGM. After much negotiation we were offered 3 nights paid for by the Mandalay Bay if we stayed at the MGM in stead of 1 night they were first offering. This really was still not satisfactory as we had stayed at the MGM before and had a bad experience there. Manadaly Bay put us into a position that we had no option but to take that offer, otherwise we would be sleeping at the airport for the next 6 nights! We will not be going back there again. My Husband the next day sent an email to the boss of Mandalay Bay and 2 days later had a reply: Mandalay Bay was going to pay for all of out stay at the MGM plus resort fees and tax. Well, can't complain at that so i'll give Mandalay Bay another star. But to be hounest, if they don't hounour peoples bookings that have been made they should pay adequate compensation! Particularly with the amount of money they made re-selling the rooms to a bunch of party go-ers at inflated prices! Top tip. If your not happy with what they are offering, makesure they compensate you fully!"

It is also joint to Luxor which is another great hotel and you can use all their facilities too. - A must is the bar on the 65th floor the views over the strip are the best in Vegas - The pool and beach area is fantastic. Negatives: - The hotel is at the very top of the strip so it does involve a lot of walking to get about. We used the bus which costs 7 dollars for a 24 hour pass and you can hop on and off as much as you like. - The que at check in was very long and very slow Must Do's in Vegas: - Gonderla in the Venetian - Dinner at the top of the Eiffel Tower - Trip to the outlet centre for bargains! - MGM lion enclosure - A look around the Winn hotel and shops - Bellagio Fountains"

The biggest complaint I have about the property though is the failure to have the rooms available at the appointed check in. While I understand wanting to cater to the VIPs, when the weekend is sold out, late check out, especially in rooms that are of limited number, should not be allowed. Having checked in through VIP services myself, I was appalled that it was 9:00 p.m. before my room was ready. If the guest before us needed additional time, arrangements could have been made to provide him with a regular room to store his things, take a shower, etc. without holding up the two bedroom suite."

This kind of stuff doesn't really bother myself or my family. The hotel is much calmer than the MGM grand, which was nice. The pool area is amazing with a nice lazy river and wave pool. It does get super crowded- I was just happy that we were there early in the day and during the week. The bar tender told us that the weekends get really crazy. We did see THe Lion King show and it was excellent. I highly recommend it! Only ate food by the pool, but it was decent. Drinks are super expensive.

I was also offered by e mail a suite at the bellagio but turned it down because I had never stayed at the hotel. Mandalay Bay itself was crowed with 2 big conventions, so you had to wait in line for an elevator at 4:30 or 5PM. Room itself was ok, nothing special. Most of the restaurants are overpriced.

But, twas a nice room, large, clean, well adorned with a very comfy bed and splendid shower......................... AND guess what, for 5 days no elevator line ups, same on the 33rd my daughter's floor...... The pool area was great, always found a lounger, less so shade, cure being more swimming, we loved the wave pool and lazy river, the staff are very hard working and nice, safety is paramount, true a beer is $8, but it's a big can..................... Pity, the lazy river, on our last lap of the trip consumed my Rayban's, watch going under the waterfalls! The staff at the Mandalay where great at every level, curtious and knowledgable. We ate the buffet a few times and it was sumptious, plus, there's cheap, good food near by. We used the tram lots, accordingly the Mandalay's southern location bothered us, not at all. Considering the round the clock wining and dining going on, some walking was welcome, albeit, during our December visit we walked from the Trop' to Freemount Street, something that the 110F temperatures precluded this time. The casino and slots where good to us, and complimentary drinks, good drinks, especialy the Sam Adams beer flowed like the lazy river. All in all the Mandalay was fantastic, we loved every minute."

The room decor is nice and the rooms are large, they just need to be refreshed and the housekeeping manager should be fired. It took 2 phone calls and a trip to the front desk to get it resolved. It still took 4 hours. Service at the pool was lacking, it took over an hour to get a cheeseburger and turkey sandwich. I had to BUY a tube to use in the lazy river...$24.00.

We had been discussing it for years as all of our children had wanted to go for their 21st. Since they were all of age we thought a family trip as adults would be fun. We booked and paid cash for our trip through a local travel agent in Feb, 2011. A flight and hotel package was purchased with Allegiant Air. We called June 25th and confirmed our reservations for 4 rooms for four nights at Mandalay. We really wanted this vacation to be 5 star and were willing to pay the extra for it. We even popped for limo service to the hotel. When we arrived the reservation clerk took our information and left for about 15 min. When she returned she told us that they had over booked our hotel and we were being transfered to MGM. This happened to many travelers including the couple next to us who came from Australia. We have traveled to vegas many times and have stayed at MGM before and I swore I would never stay there again, hate it. Don't like the location, don't like to gamble there and do not find the rooms a great value. I had nixed it right away when suggested as option by our travel agent. I called my travel agent on Monday June 27 and eventually found the source of our problem. The Electric Daisy Dance concert was in Vegas and was told that after Mandalay Bay offered, booked and accepted payment for rooms they discovered they could resale them for up to $700 a night. They literally sold the luxury vacation we had purchases a a Christmas gift for our family to a higher bidder. When asked for room at MIrage instead I was told \"NO.\" We were not thrilled with location of Mandalay Bay but thought the great pools would make it worth the extra effort to get to our preferred location on the strip. If we could not have stayed at Mandalay, I would have chosen Venetian or Palazzo as they are my favorites. I was told by a couple of guys we met from Ireland that they were booked for Luxor and were transfered to the El Cortez. My travel agent told me that the Allegiant agent had a laundry list of customers who had the same problem and MGM properties had did this to travelers from all different agencies who had negotiated rates in good faith. I don't mean to sound like a snob. I am happy stay at a 3 star hotel, we do it all the time but this was a special trip and I purchased a luxury vacation and they had my money for months. It was too late for me to book with another hotel chain and I was stuck with what they gave me with no apologies. It makes me sick the disrespect for how hard we worked and sacrificed for this vacation. It was a special day that can never be regained. Not to mention we spent hours between the two hotels checking in. We were told that our travel agent would be refunded for the rooms but they refused to put that promise in writing. Unbelievable and slimmy business practice. We only get a couple of weeks off a year and it seems terrible that we should not get what we paid for. I would never book with this chain again. Beware Electric daisy dance is a five year vegas contract and is the last week of June each year. Room rates are going to be horrific and if you are promised a good rate you will likely find yourself without a room as it brings in at between one and two hundred thousand people."

The pools are great, but there is no shade anywhere (you can rent an umbrella and chair for $50-75, seriously!!)...hello skin cancer and they are really crowded. The restaurants at Mandalay Bay offer tons of choices from Aureole to RM Seafood to many lower end places. Great options all around. Just a few minor complaints...could not get anyone on the phone at Guest Services or Concierge, always busy, so you had to go downstairs for any assistance. They do charge for every little thing which can get a bit annoying, but, I guess, it is what it is. Overall, a great place.

Kitchen/bar area (no kitchen appliances except a mini fridge) , large living/dining room area, good sized bedroom with large bathroom that housed a double person jetted tub and a HUGE shower that converted in to a steam room. The pool was gorgeous and even though it was hot out, we didn't have any issues finding a chair on the one day that we used the pool. Water temperature was good too, unlike our previous stay at Planet Hollywood, it wasn't so cold that it almost took your breath away. The UGLY part of our trip came during the night of our reception. I had previously researched what hotels/suites were good for in-suite receptions and who had the least amount of problems. Several brides had used the Vista suite for a reception, even with a DJ, with absolutely no issues. Our DJ himself had just done 8 weddings in the last several weeks in the Vista without having any problems. The hotel knew about our reception, and even confirmed with me that the room fit 30 people comfortably (the MB website, also, says that the room fits 25-30). At 9:30pm, we received a knock on the door asking us to please turn the music down slightly, so we turned it down. Another knock about 20 minutes later and it was the same guy, apologizing and asking us to turn it down once more. So we did. Not long after, an abundance of security showed up and said that everyone but the registered guests had to leave. To make a long story short, they were very rude, and treated us and all of our guests like criminals. We offered to just shut the music right off and explained it was our wedding and they didn't care. The night manager himself came up after I asked to speak to him, and all he could do was stand there with a smirk on his face. I am not one to over react or get my feelings hurt easily, but I can say it's safe to say I have never, ever been treated so poorly by hotel staff as I have here. Mandalay Bay wins in dining options, front desk & amenity staff attitude, pools and casino, but their lack of customer service and respect was missing when they visited our suite. My husband and I, along with our guests, were appalled at how we were treated."

I know people smoke in Casino but that does mean a non smoking room has to smell. Also there was not a vent in the bathroom which made it worse when you took a shower. The pool area was nice and the staff was nice. Also they charged $1.50 to print out my boarding pass. Lastly at check out they tried to charge an extra $70 for the food and snacks in the room that we never touched. So just watch your bill."

    "content": "Just returned from a 5 day stay with my 12 and 14 year old daughters. Overall it was a really nice stay. I was quite concerned by all the negative remarks left by other posters. Any problems identified were relatively minor. Most of the problems posted by others were not things I particularly found to complain about. Some you have to take with a grain of salt. Others had shades of truth. Our check-in experience was did not leave a great first impression. Where many other hotels have a common queue, Mandalay Bay has separate lines for each agent. Some agents move quickly, others move slowly. I felt like my line moved like molasses compared to my neighboring lines. A shared queue would have been much better. Yes, there is a resort fee, but the fee does grant you unlimited wireless internet, a free daily newspaper (picked up at one of the gift shops), free local and toll-free calls, free access to the business center and exercise room. A little pricey for what you get, but it is what it is. We made good use of the internet (2 laptops) and newspaper. Other than that, we didn't use much of the other \"resort fee\" amenities. Many posters complained of slowness of the elevators. In five days and numerous trips up and down the 20th floor, we hardly ever waited for more than 30 seconds for a car to arrive. If you are riding the elevator around the time when the pools close or when people are off to or returning from a meeting, your wait might be longer. The rooms are quite large. We had a standard room facing the airport and strip. The bathrooms are quite large with 2 sinks, a deep bathtub and separate walk in shower. Our mattress and sheets were quite comfortable. There were a few minor maintenance issues, but nothing functionally wrong. One minor irritation. We had 4 guests in our room, but each day we were restocked with 3 sets of towels until we finally left a post-it note on the mirror to request more towels. Up until that point we had to hunt down a maid for an extra set. The real reason why you stay at Mandalay Bay over any other site on The Strip is for the pool experience. The wave pool, lazy river, and numerous pools are well maintained. Many people complained of not being able to find a lounge chair. We didn't experience the same issue. Granted, we could never find 4 chairs together, but then again, we only used the chairs for placing our towels and sunscreen. All our time was in the pool, not laying around. The tubes for sale are way overpriced. We ended up picking up some at the nearby CVS for $6 compared to $26 charged at the resort. My wife and I took some time away to indulge in the spa for a massage. This was the highlight of our stay. The spa experience contains a steam room, dry sauna, warm and hot tubs, and shower facilities. Before and after your massage you can enjoy the quiet escape of the facilities. The trip to this resort would not have been complete without a visit to the Spa. The first floor experience was a bit of a mix. In particular, the smell of smoking was probably more noticeable than many other LV resorts. We found the food experience a bit limiting for kids. Being on the extreme south end of the Strip, going to another resort was not always a viable option. Most of the restaurants are on the higher end side. House of Blues provided us the best dining experience with kids. The buffet, Raffles, and the noodle house were all quite good. Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much. Frankly, the only reason why we chose Mandalay Bay was for the pool experience, and the resort did not disappoint."

We had a small get-together and with wine and cheese...and even though the room has a bar area with a sink and fridge...they didn't stock glasses in the room...we only had 4....not really what you would expect in a suite...especially since there was plenty of room to stock more wine glasses. Not a big deal...I'd still stay here again! Oh, one other thing...some of the lights in the room have switches only on the cord...not on the lamp it self...so you have to pull the cord out from behind the nightstand to turn it on and off...this is Vegas...don't make me think too hard after being out all night! lol Great place to stay...highly recommend it!"

It had the look, the price, the staff, the casino, the pool, etc. Little did we know though that it was THAT far of a walk to the rest of the hotels. Of course we read the reviews on the location of the Hotel, but we are young and thought that it would be fine. Vegas is a little overwhelming though and it is much bigger and more spread out than it looks on TV and movies. This hotel would be good for people that have been to Vegas before or on a business trip, but for new comers, it's a bit of a walk. I know that there is a tram that takes you to Luxor & Excalibur but even with the tram, it's still a walk to New York, then across the bridge to MGM and on down the strip. Overall though, we enjoyed our stay and we WILL stay at Mandalay again, but not until we stay a few more times near the middle of the strip. Have fun in Vegas and Enjoy... because it's like no other place in this WORLD!"

We were given a suite as compensation on the 29th Floor with views of the airport and a little glimpse of the airport. On the whole the occasion was very enjoyable. Watch out for the extras though - they charge you to put your own water in the fridge and nuts were $10! The monorail out of the hotel was useful, but boy because the place was so big we did a hell of lot of walking. Didn't get much of the amenities, tried the beach which was fun, but pretty crowded. |It was a pity we lost nearly half a day, because we didn't get much opportunity to use the pools. The service was a bit rubbish, the reception clerks had no explanation of why our rooms were not ready and were not apologetic enough. At checking out no-one could tell my husband what they were charging to his card, we still can't understand the bill!"

Check in was a little slow but it was very bussy! The hotel offers a wide selection of dining, from quick bites to posh nosh! ALL at reasonable prices, the breakfast buffet is a must if you are planning along day away from Vegas its self. The hotel is away from all the action, but within walking distance. Personally I liked the location. Overall a fantastic hotel, with great staff and services, its clean and tidy, every effort has been made to make the guests stay as pleasant as can be for a decent price. I'm glad I payed the bit extra for a hotel that was MUCH much better than expectation."

I am so dissapointed, in fact, that I am writing this review as i sit in my hotel room at the Mandalay Bay. During our previous stay, we booked the standard room and were very impressed. This time around we decided to \"upgrade\" to the 750 suite. The minute we got off the elevator, the entire 10th floor smelled like the stale cigarettes and we booked a non-smoking. Our room wasn't any better. The carpet is in terrible shape, the room smells of cigarette, the furniture is dirty, and unkept. You would think a suite would offer you a view of the strip, but instead we are staring at the airport and hearing it too. There are a ton of families here, why? why? why? anyone would bring children to Las Vegas is beyond me. As for the bed...wow...I am staring at a cigarette stain and a rip in the sheets and the pillows may as well be tossed in the garbage as they have absolutely no Fluff left in them. Anyhow, after sleeping 4 hours last night we woke up and decided to end our stay earlier and head over to the Wynn. The woman on the phone from the Wynn is already 100 times more helpful and professional than anyone we have encountered at the Mandalay Bay so far. I am just glad we stayed on a Monday when it was only 140 dollars as opposed to 350 later in the week. i am sure for the price, you will be dissapointed!!!!!! I will post the photos when we get home."

So many great restaurants to choose from that we didn't need to ever leave (though we did a couple of times). One of the best parts of the trip for her was that I surprised her with a cabana by the pool. The pool area has a million (ok, slight exageration) chaise lounges to sit in but the pool area is also very popular and fills up fast. Having a cabana gives you some SPACE! Space plus a frige, a couch, SHADE, a TV (never turned it on), a table to eat at, innertubes for the lazy river, and three lounges. Oh, and you have three or so people constantly coming to see if you would like anything. :) It was heaven! The cabana was as important as our room... and I paid more for it! It was worth it though. Our room was great too. Plenty of room, nice decor, a HUGE bathroom. My pet peeve in hotel rooms is the weighted fridge. This is not a fridge I can use. Even if I did buy anything out of it, you still can't chill your water or half a sandwich or a thing. I want a fridge I can use in my hotel room, not a mini concessions stand! Even so, next trip will be with my hubby."

    "content": "First, the PROS: Really beautiful property, well-maintained and very clean. Though it is very elegant, one doesn't feel out-of-place in casual attire. Friendly, if somewhat inept (see below) staff. We stayed in a 2-BD, 2 BA suite and it was gorgeous, with a panoramic view of the Strip, the mountains and the pool. Very comfortable beds and nice flat screen TVs--there were even small TVs in the bathrooms. The bathrooms were really amazing--both had huge whirlpool tubs for 2, and a separate shower. Now, alas, the CONS: 1. Bad Check-in. We arrived at about noon after a very long flight. I had requested an early check-in, but that was denied, allegedly because the suite we had booked was not ready. So we checked our bags and went to have lunch and look around. by 2 pm, we were all dragging. Still, the room was not ready. There were lots of other people around who were getting their room keys. There was not one place to sit down and wait. We ended up sitting on the floor of the lobby for over an hour--the room was not even ready by the 3 pm check in time. There were only a few desk clerks working, although there was a massive check-in desk with room for lots of clerks. 2. Annoying housekeepers. Although housekeeping had allegedly kept us waiting for hours to get our room, they showed up like clockwork every morning of our stay at about 9:30--WAY too early for Vegas!! They did not seem to understand \"please come back later,\" as they did not do so. The only day our suite was cleaned was the day we left early for a day tour. 3. Pool not open enough. Despite the fact that it was over 100 degrees during the day--way too hot to hang out at a concrete-surrounded pool--the pool closed every day at 7 pm--HUH?? I chose the hotel in part because I thought my kids would love the pool. However, it wasn't open when they wanted to swim. Had I known this, I would have stayed somewhere else. Sad. 4. Location. I knew this when I booked, and it would have been OK if we had been able to utilize the pool, but the hotel is on the very southern end of the Strip. You will either be walking a lot or paying for cabs. 5. Check-out. Check out is at 11 (again, WAY too early for Vegas!). We didn't need to leave for the airport until 12, so we called and requested one extra hour. DENIED!! We were told that \"late check-out isn't available for suites.\" Huh?? So if we had booked a $99 room on Priceline, we could have gotten the extra hour, but because we booked a very expensive suite, we couldn't get one extra hour? Definitely not the way to have repeat customers. Bottom line: unless you can book a really cheap room, or you plan to be so blitzed you don't care, stay somewhere else. In the end, even the nicest room won't compensate for indifferent service."

The Aureole with the Wine Tower (someone abseils up it to get your bottle!) is great fun & the \"taster menu\" of 8 courses is superb. The only fault I would find with Mandalay Bay is that the pool area is incredibly busy & noisy. The Lazy River is fun, and there are several pools, but the sunbeds are packed in. It was difficult to find any sunbeds at all in the afternoon, but that is probably because people leave pool towels on them instead of returning them when they have finished. The towels are also tiny, so either make sure you ask for two or bring your own if you want one of a decent size!The music by the wave pool is loud enough on its own - when you can also hear the music from the next door pool club it gets really annoying. It's not a relaxing pool experience. While this hotel is at the end of the Strip there is a tram to the nearby Luxor & Excalibur which is good. And it is only a short walk to MGM, Tropicana, New York etc. It took a long time before our bags were delivered, so I would advise taking them to & from your room yourself. The casino is as good as any with some nice bar areas. Look out for the free drink vouchers in your welcome pack. I would definitely stay here again."

Check in was efficient as well as check out. Sleeping Room: My room was very nice; Updated, clean. Housekeeping staff did a great job! I Loved the large bathroom! The bed was comfortable. I was attending a convention so, the walk from my room to the meeting rooms seemed like miles and miles away....I feel like I must have walked through at least 2 zip codes;) Location: The hotel's location was a little further than I had hoped for. Wished we would have been in the middle of the strip with easier access to the other casinos and restaurants. Atmosphere: The hotel was busy, so it was nice to see the \"hustle and bustle\" through out the day and late into the night. Initially, I thought that most casinos on the strip would be busy all the time, but found this to not be true. This made me appreciate the Mandalay even more. Evening Dining: Thoroughly enjoyed the Foundation Room. Appetizers and wine was excellent and the view was fantastic! Rate: Since I was on business, I wasn't as concerned with the room rate we paid, however, had this been out of pocket, I certainly would have considered other options. In the future, when I go back to Vegas for personal travel, I will certainly consider returning to Mandalay Bay, assuming I am able to secure a lower rate."

    "content": "MB is an amazing place, the pools alone are a must for all the water babies in your life! If you book through MB, you can get a great price on a room (108 for a Q/Q) and 30% off Lion King tickets - it is worth it, breathtaking and perfect for the MB theater. Watch out for busy weekends, the elevators were a problem, just too many people, long waits if you have to be some where. Room was great. Also, PERFECT valets, these guys move, all day, all night, so nice regardless how tired they are and that my car was #143...Kudos to hard working people! My only negative comment about MB' is room service! Very expensive as compared to other luxury resorts, poor quality, and they charge an \"extra fee\". This is not tax or tip....I had $10 added to a bill for a small pizza and wings. When I asked the waiter to explain, I was told that was for the glasses of water and the 2 baby ketchup bottles. I had not asked for either! Who puts ketchup on pizza??? The front desk removed the fee for me but I am sure someone is making big bucks off this scam. Room service will ask how many people, lie and say 1, then they will only charge you for 1 ketchup! For travelers with kids, bring a lot of clothes. There is no laundry service, only very expensive dry cleaning. We stayed 4 days and ran out of clothes, I would have gladly paid for laundry service, instead we went to the outlets and bought new clothes. Other advice; scorching heat so plan wisely, eat at JAMMS, get to Pawn Shop, fish Lake Mead.......PS MB buffet is amazing and well worth the money, plan to gain weight!"

    "content": "In the past few years, I've been to every hotel on the strip, and none matches the feeling of comfort and elegance of Mandalay Bay. (With the exception of maybe Wynn or Bellagio :P) Anyways, the hotel in itself is palatial, and almost all public spaces are adorned with beautiful details of grand proportion. The colors aren't dark and uninviting, but rather light and airy, but not too light, and still retaining some old charm. The rooms are a STEAL! However, you must note that they haven't renovated for a while, and some furniture is not in an excellent state. However, the size of the rooms are very satisfactory, with a massive bathroom with double sinks, jet tub, and walk in shower. The beach complex is simply the BEST in Las Vegas, and perhaps ranks among the top in the world for a hotel! They just offer so many amenities, fine dining, entertainment, shopping, that it's simply a wonderful hotel. *However, it is located on an end of the strip, but you can easily get to Excalibur using the Mandalay Bay - Luxor - Excalibur free tram that runs all day. From there, it'll be much easier to walk."

The quality of the resort and rooms is wonderful. Very roomy with a great bed. Not many choices on the TV but hey, you're in Vegas- get out of your room ;-) The casino is set up nicely so that guests have an option of whether they want to participate in gaming or can basically avoid the floor. The elevators get quite busy and you're forced to intuit which elevator will open next so that you can be in close proximity before the hordes descend and you have to wait (sometimes there's a bit of a wait) for the next elevator. The folks who work at Mandalay Bay are on a whole very helpful and super nice. The only exception was in some of the food areas (buffet and Raffles) but for every one that was less that great there were two that would go out of their way to provide excellent service. So hit or miss on that score. There are numerous fine restaurants by celebrity chefs on the property that offer an array of wonderful dining experiences! Even the toiletries are great there we had a very good experience and I would absolutely stay there again."

The Lion King exceeded all expectations. It was incredible! The hotel was a little disappointing. The rooms are stocked with alcohol. The refrigerator is weighted so if anything is removed you are charged. That meant there was no room to place your own items to keep cool. There was no coffee maker in the room. For families on a budget, this could be a challenge since the restaurants are pricey. Our bathroom had a very large black stain on the floor which took away from the appeal of the room. The toilet paper holder kept falling off the wall. On the positive side, the wave pool, lazy river and outdoor resort areas were beautiful. I felt like I was relaxing at the beach instead of being in the middle of the desert. Overall, I would not choose this hotel next time I visit Las Vegas."

If it is your first time in Vegas be prepaired for Sticker Shock. Yikes! I had a hard time with that! Enjoy your trip! Oh ya, if your going to work out in the Cardio Room go early to get a machine.

The Mandalay was definitely at the top of that list!! The room size is wonderful - and we got the very basic room. Loved the separate tub (bring bubble bath!). TV in the bathroom was a nice touch. We had a pool view, which was fun. We stayed on the 14th floor and liked the floor to ceiling windows. Comfy beds. Nice desk with 2 solid chairs. Housekeeping was great; they even accomodated our requests to have the room made up late in the afternoon, promptly brought towels, etc. The wave pool was a blast; definitely well-supervised. The lazy river was not lazy; a good-paced current kept you moving. Yes, there's a bunch of people, but it is summer and it is hot!!! We always got chairs in a great location, and more than one each time. Yes, we went in the mornings, but even late morning things always worked out!! Hint: bring your own tube. They will cheerfully inflate it for you. Small tubes run $16, large tubes run $24. We bought ours at the grocery store at home: $2.24!!! Just plan ahead!! The casino has a good vibe. It was nice to take the tram to Luxor, and Excalibur for more playing options. Or simply take the tram to Excalibur, walk across the pedestrian bridges and you have MGM, NewYork NewYork, and Tropicana for even more choices. We've always stayed more center-strip, and didn't mind the location of Mandalay one bit!!! There are a few more restaurant choices in the Mandalay Place Shops, but walk across the street and you have McDonald's for breakfast, and Subway or Panda Express for lunch if you desire economical options. Saw Recycled Percussion at the Tropicana. Not usually a show person but this one was worth it (got a 2 for 1 coupon in the in-room magazine). Lots of audience participation; noisy, though, so take note if that's not your thing! All in all, I would whole-heartedly recommend the Mandalay Bay when coming to stay in Vegas. We will definitely try this again ~ we had a blast!!!"

We got a deal when booking through MB where we got $100 off of a cabana rental. There were five of us, so we split the cost. I would highly recommend it if you can swing it. Included in the cost of the cabana rental was a mini fridge w/ice, water, and pop. It also came with two intertubes for the lazy river. We had a cabana in the West Lagoon.

This was our 5th time to Las Vegas but 1st time staying at Mandalay Bay. Check-In--From the time I was in line, to the time I got a key it wasn't even 10min. Elevators-Never had to wait longer than 5min for one. Rooms-We requested a 2 queen non-smoking and got it on the 14th floor. We were facing THEhotel. This is fine since we aren't the type to need a great view. The room and bathrooms were clean. My 2yr old loved the seperate bathtub and the t.v. in the bathroom. I liked the t.v. in bathroom also so I could watch my shows while getting ready. The t.v. in the room is a great size with good channels. My kids had something to watch that they actually liked. I always read these stories about the mini bar and snack tray and being charged for lifting the items. Well, don't lift them!! Just kidding. I called down to see if there was a way to lock the mini bar because I didn't want my toddler to move anything. A man answered the call and was so nice. He said,\" Sure, do you want me to send someone to remove the snack tray as well?\" I didn't finish saying yes when I heard the fridge lock. Someone came for the snack tray while we were at dinner. Service-everywhere we went everyone treated us great. Food-We only ate at the buffet here twice. Once for dinner and once for breakfast. Both times we had great service and great food. Pool/Beach-this place was a hit with my kids. I like that they have an area for the kids to swim and still experience the wave pool. My 2yr old loved it! My husband had $8 Coronas at the beach...ouch! But hey, it's Vegas! When we first got to the beach area, there weren't any chairs available. We got there in the afternoon! Ooops! But after walking around for 5min, a couple offered their lounge chairs since they were leaving and there was another one next to it so we had 3 lounge chairs. We bought an inner tube there for $16 something but it could only be used in the lazy river. That sucked! Entertainment--We didn't see any shows but we have been to the Shark Reef twice on different occasions before. The Shark Reef is fun for the kids. Check-Out--We left at 6:30am so there wasn't anybody else checking out. We had a great time at Mandalay Bay and will return for sure!"

The large TV was fine, but did not spend much time watching it. I found the small TV in the bathroom more useful to catch the news and sports while getting ready. I was there for a conference, spent my days working, brief stops in the room before heading out for the activities of the evening. There were a lot of kids, after all, what other Vegas hotel has a beach and a wave pool? The pool area was busy most of the time. The room was not real clean, not sure if the cleaning staff is undermanned or under managed, either way, dust remained in the corners, the sinks had circles around the drain and the back side of the faucets were not clean. The hotel is about 12 years old and showing some wear and tear mostly in the rooms. The casino area used some sort of aroma that everytime I passed through kicked my allergies off, something that I am not accustomed to having occur. The check in was very smooth with a very brief wait despite a busy time. We arrived early, a colleague was staying at THe Hotel, he was able to check in at the same desk as I was, making that convenient for us. We arrived well before check in time, about 11:30, both rooms were ready, I am sure that won't be possible everytime. The electronic check out on the TV was not available when I tried to check out, but check out at the desk was very quick. Used a few wake up calls while there and they worked like clock work. As to noise, the door seems to have a higher gap than normal, I heard some hall sounds, a few slammed doors, sounds from other showers etc, seemed a bit loud. The bed was just average, the bedding a bit tired. Hotel keys must be shown everytime you go to the elevators to get to the rooms and the pool. The location is somewhat secluded, large and self contained though getting to the Luxor and the Excalibur was easy via the free tram. The convention center is very large, plan to walk alot while you are there. Food on the sight is pretty typical of a higher end property, the buffet was efficient and plentiful, though the Sun brunch is an additional 10 dollars. Thought the cabfare to and from the airport would be less given its proximety, but it was about $16 to get there and $21 to go back, not a fan of the Vegas cab drivers anyway, they always seem to grab you- either they take you the long way (the highway) or if ask for a recomendation, they take you and go right in and collect a spiff."

Check-in was very pleasnt and we got room on higest 34 floor with panoramic view of strip and that is SOMETHING, beautiful view with airport on right side but with perfect sound isolation you cant even hear the planes... Rooms are great, comfort, beds are big, bathroom is maybe the best part of room, luxury with separated sinks and tv inside... We spent a lot of time on pool(s) and had great time, it is the probaby best pool complex in vegas, with eight pools, lazy river, pool with artificial waves, sand on the beach, much lifeguards, the only objection to the pool area is that they charge air mattress that you can only use in lazy river and drinks on beach are much overpriced.... overall impression is excellent and Mandalay bay would again be my choice."

    "content": "A great hotel, with only one negative thing: the elevators. In the morning between 9 and 12 and the evenings between 16 and 19 was kinda hopeless. Had to go down when I was going up and vice versa to get room in the elevator. If it went to the beach level and somebody stepped in and chose a higher floor number than the ground floor, it would go straight up. That means it could go up and down several times without stopping where 98 % of the people were. That's crazy to me! It lies at the end of the strip, and some might think of that as a bad thing, but when \"doing\" The Strip, you will need to use the bus at one time (when you have walked so much you can hardly stand anymore), because of great distances from one attraction to another. When you enter the bus outside Mandalay Bay, it is always room and seating available, and that's not always the case when entering mid or late on The Strip. Use the express bus if possible, the Deuce bus uses a loooong time from one end to another. Over all a big, clean, okay-prized, nice-looking hotel. Remember to go to the M Club if you are gambling there, we thought they comped alright and service was good. They are also members of the MGM chain and you will be ble to collect points at several hotels on The Strip."

If this is a pleasure trip and your firs time in Vegas stay more central on the strip or be prepared to walk a lot! Strip was the best place to eat in the hotel. If you stay at the high end half of the hotel, called The Hotel, it is really nice all the rooms are suites and you are removed from the casino floor and it is actually quite nice."

The elevators were a problem almost every time we needed to go from lobby to room, tons of people waiting. Rooms were fine, price was decent, clean, nice but no fabulous suite from the hangover. No noise from adjoining rooms, but quite a bit of noise from hallway and hallways were smoked out. We did have a nice view of the strip. But you have a nice view because you are at the end of the strip which means you basically have to cab it everywhere. It was no problem to get a cab from Mandalay Bay but a pain at the end of the night when we needed a cab from whatever show or club we were at. We ate at Raffles for breakfast which was good, strong bloody mary, and yummy breakfast food. We also ate at the mexican place in the hotel, Border Grill, which was also good. The Mandalay Beach is nice. They have two pools, a wave pool, sand, and a lazy river. But, and this is the big problem, it is totally overused/overbooked. We booked a beach cabana which was the right move, otherwise you would not be able to find space or beach chairs. The cabana was nice, came with tv, fridge that was fully stocked with soda and water, a high-top, outdoor lounge, a safe and two floats for the lazy river. We had dedicated wait staff and a towel fetcher. The beach menu is limited, no breakfast option without meat b/c its all pre-made, lunch had better options."

We didn't eat at any of the restaurants on the property, but they all looked very appealing. We took advantage of our free drink coupons and each had a drink at Orchid Lounge. Drinks were good! The pool is to die for! There is a shallow area for little kids, a wave pool for bigger kids and adults, and a lazy river for everyone. We spent lots of time at the pool and had no problem finding a place to put our stuff and lounge, but we were there midweek. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Vegas. You really don't need to leave, it has lots of restaurants, shopping, shows, pool - what else do you need!"

Some advice for anyone staying here-get the highest floor you can. We stayed on the 26th floor and it was great going down but getting back up to our room was just impossible! We learned our lesson- get on any elevator and ride it-then quickly press the floor you need to go to. Once we got on from our floor(26th) rode it to the 33th floor,went back down and we stopped every floor going up-went back down and by the 26th floor going down,it was full! After that we stopped intermittently and the few lower floors(21st,19th,17) everyone in ours kept telling those outside SORRY!-NO ROOM-and you could tell they were very,very upset.Another time-(learning our lesson) we got on an elevator from the lobby level-to the beach level(1floor down)-and rode the elevator back up-and it was got full from the beach level already! So getting on is the way to go-no matter where you get on. The views from our room was fantastic so being on the upper level paid off for us."

    "content": "I wouldn't normally travel to Vegas with kids but we went to a concert and it was at Mandalay so it was convenient. I got a great package deal through Allegiant for a three night stay and thought it would be a great hotel for kids. I had stayed there with my husband after it first opened years ago. I'm kind of mixed on this review. The hotel itself is showing its age and wearing in the public areas. I would give the hotel itself 3 stars but the service stood out. Check-in went well and we were given a room at the end of the hall on 14th fl with a pool view. That was fine with me and the room location was very quiet, which can be hard to find in Vegas. Beware there can be long waits for an elevator. The room looked like it had been refurbished and was nicely decorated. The bathroom is terrific; large with stall shower and jacuzzi tub and separate toilet, which I really like. Here's what I didn't like -- the sheets were the worst I have slept on in a long time. Literally scratchy and they use a top sheet for the mattress and it does NOT stay tucked in so any time you roll over it comes off the mattress. Very irrirating. I was really looking forward to the pool and thought my girls would love the beach theme. We got out to the pool at 10am (it opens at 9) and there wasn't one lounge chair to be found. I'm used to this at beach resorts but was surprised to have to deal with this at a hotel so large. I think they allow non-hotel guests to use pools for a fee and this was a beautiful Saturday so it was very crowded. We ended up renting reserved chairs for $100 each -- that's more than what a lot of people pay for the nightly room rate there. I guess they make up for it on things like this and I wasn't the only parent in line shelling that out in desperation just to have a place to sit (besides the concrete, which plenty of people had to do.) Sunday we looked out our room window and noticed the pool was much less busy so if you're pooling it on a Saturday, be prepared, and if there are more than two of you the smaller cabanas are a better deal to reserve. My kids did enjoy the pool (weren't blown away by it) and the food and drink service was excellent. You have to buy tubes to use at the lazy river and wave pool if you want them ($20+ each) so we passed on those. The bathrooms around the hotel were messy and often not clean. All the service staff in the restaurants we went to were very good and kind to my kids. I added incorrectly on the room service tab and they called and aksed me about it and corrected it -- not problem. We had a nail polish spill (ugh!!) in the room and I called housekeeping right away and expected to have a room charge for a ruined carpet, but when we returned from concert the stain was completely out. Valet was also very friendly. Those things made me bump it to a 4 star overall."

Room decor had some nice touches and the bed was good; gave us 4 solid nights of sleep. The towels smelled--like smoke sometimes, like burned popcorn sometimes. The pool is excellent, although very crowded. There is a wave pool, a lazy river and several smaller pool areas to choose from. The main casino area has a positive energy to it. Sportsbook was pretty decent. One of its bars had a good cover band playing rock and roll hits most nights and several other clubs and restaurants as well. The one (major) drawback for the hotel is location--being at the far end makes getting to most anywhere on the strip a time consuming ordeal. We ate at Raffles a couple of times; service was mixed, but the food was tasty and a pretty good deal for the strip."

Initially, I was placed in a room directly above the taxi stand. It did not feel private at all. When I complained, I was moved to a better location, but the second room, like the first, contained rather dated & worn furnishings & fixtures. I would have expected nicer from a hotel with premium pricing, like the Mandalay Bay. The bedspread was noticeably dusty & had human hairs scattered across it. Again, when I complained, the staff promptly responded. The key cards for room entry malfunctioned multiple times, but, again, the staff were courteous & responsive to the problem. I plan to give Mandalay Bay another try during next year's conference, & hopefully, their standards will have returned to what I experienced two years ago."

This is our eighth trip. My husband and I booked a deluxe room and were hoping to upgrade to a suite upon arrival. Being that it was a weekend and that there was a slot tournament, we were not able to get a suite at either Mandalay Bay or TheHotel. For a regular room, it was very spacious. King bed, couch with table, and large bathroom that had both a tub and separate shower. Nice low energy lighting in all rooms. I can't say the room was completely clean as there was a stain on the carpet upon entry and some midew in the shower, but overall pretty clean. It still has one of those bedspreads that you take off the bed before you sleep in it, but the sheets and pillows were good quality. Now that I think about it, the telephone was very old and dirty as well. There were two closets and a double sink which made for plenty of room when getting ready for a wedding. The thing I like the most about Mandalay Bay is the smell of coconut and how bright it is inside. It feels very tropical and not like a dark casino. There are many restaurant choices either at the hotel or in Mandalay Place (the adjacent shopping area) although nothing that serves quick and cheap food like pizza, breakfast sandwiches, etc. But the restaurants that we went to were great quality and quantity, so you get what you pay for (for Strip prices). The biggest thing to take into consideration when staying at Mandalay Bay is the location. It is at the far south end of the strip, so it takes a little bit of effort to go anywhere else. But really you have everything you need here unless your plan is to explore the whole strip. If you want to explore you can take the tram to Excalibur and walk from there. Overall, I would recommend this hotel. Very nice and FUN casino, lots of great restaurants, great pool, and decent rooms."

When I booked the room for the conference I requested a King bed however, when I checked in was told there were only two queens available. During the middle of my check in someone else came up next to me, and was given a King bed, and I was told he had a \"higher class\" than me. We were promised a room change for the following day, but no one ever called us. The only other problem was the pool. We had a conference of about 4000 people, and the pool could clearly not handle all of us. After searching for chairs for about 45 minutes we finally paid $50 a chair to sit in a VIP section after waiting in line there for an additional half an hour. The main issue I had was that there was another pool that is only open on Friday and Saturday, and they refused to open it for us. When you are trying to accommodate that many people sometimes you have to make some exceptions. Other than that we had a great time. The restaurants were all amazing. Granted they were a little pricey, but if you go during happy hour you can usually find some good food and drinks specials. We ate at House of Blues one night and our receipt entitled us to a buy one get one breakfast the next day. Mandalay Place is a fun place to walk around, and has some more casual restaurants. I also would highly recommend the ice bar Minus 5 degrees in Mandalay Place. The entire thing is made of ice right down to your drink cups. It's $25 and that gets you one drink while inside. Definitely a fun thing to do once. There is a tram to the Luxor and Excalibur that is convenient, but they aren't even that far of a walk if you're looking to get some fresh air. Keep in mind this place is hugeeee. Definitely bring your walking shoes! Overall, we had a great time and look forward to going back to Vegas again"

Casino was nice and bright with high ceilings. Eye Candy bar was a great place to meet with great sitting areas. Lots of good restaurant selection in the hotel and nearby Mandalay Place. Plenty of free parking. We liked the shower very much and the double sink was great Cons: Was expecting a lot more from the pool. The pool area looked a little run down and when full of people was not enjoyable at all to be at. Towels at the pool were often frayed and were not nice to use. Our room was not well cleaned each day... dirty glasses left in the room, and the sheets used on our beds were not properly fitted to the bed. Carpets in the hallways were often stained .... there was a spot where someone had clearly \"lost their dinner\" that was not totally cleaned up. Beware if you need a dark room to sleep, as so much light leaked in from under the doors from the hall and the adjoining room. We had to cover with towels and pillows. Noise from adjoining rooms certainly noticeable, and when a door slams nearby, it makes you jump out of your bed. One other item of note. Sitting outside at the pool you feel like the papparazzi are circling the hotel with choppers. The tour company that flies to the canyon and over the strip is nearby... apparently the landing pattern has them circling the Mandalay. Between that and the fact that planes are always taking off from nearby McCarran means its often extra noisy. We will not be returning."

Never had a problem with the elevators, as previously mentioned in other reviews. The casino is very open with a good variety of machines. Access to the Excalibur tram is a nice feature - beats walking. Ate at House of Blues for lunch, and was surprised when the waiter told us to save our receipt to use the following morning for a 2 for 1 breakfast at the restaurant. Made it out to the pool only once due to cool weather, but had no problem getting two chairs. I would definitely stay at MB again for the right price!"

    "content": "Hotel/resort is located closest to the airport in Las Vegas. From the airport, take one of the shuttles for $6.50 or $7.00 for the most economical ride. You can find them right outside the door after you pick up your bags at the airport. Buy a ticket at the kiosk and get in line. Not bad, but Mandalay was the last stop on the shuttle I took. Trip about 30 minutes. Check-in and out were brisk and efficient. The place is gargantuan. I was there to attend a large convention and the hotel handled crowd control well. Ever-present security. Very pleasant staff in all areas. Cabana/pool area really fun - you can tube around and ride the artificial waves. But be prepared for crowds at the pool area. Get a lounger early. Cabanas are $375 for the day. The convention company rented one and the service was unbelievable. The entire hotel is very clean. Casino and rooms did not smell like smoke at all. Bathroom was huge with a standard room with 2 queen beds. TV in the bathroom. If you like to work out, there is a \"free\" cardio room with treadmills and bikes and ellipticals. If you want more than that it will cost $25 per day. Workout room had full set of free weights, LifeCycle machines and all kinds of cardio, so the fee may be worth it for gym rats like me. I didn't try the spa. Food is expensive at the hotel restaurants but we splurged and went to the steak house. Wonderful food and service was attentive. Kobe beef burger was $25. That was the cheapest dish on the menu but if you expect that going in you will not lack for attention. Overall I liked staying here for a convention but for a family vacation I could not afford it. This is not a place for kids - the hotel has nothing for them."

I want a clean room, a hot shower and hassle free check-in and check-out. It was 0 for 4 on this scale. Check in was hampered with long lines and a gaggle of check in people trying to print out check in slips all at one printer which stopped working just before I reached the head of the line after a 30 minute wait. I should have known, then and there, that this was not a good omen. The room was spacious and had many nice ammenities. Nice view, nice TV, the bed was a bit too soft for my liking, but ok... But, I really could do without the prior occupants trash in the trash bins, and their used shampoo and soap still in the shower. Did they even clean it? I noticed that the cleaning of the room was hit or miss most of the week there. Some days, it was clean, and others I would find the cleaning rags left in the sink, the trash still in the room, or some portion of the room untouched. The worst part of my stay was the last morning. Getting up at 4am for a 6:30am flight, I would have liked to taken a shower to rid my hair and body of the stale cigarette smoke smell from the casino, but was I in for a nice surprise! No water! No hot water and no cold water. Calling down to the front desk got someone who said the water shoud be back on in a few hours. Great... Not even an appology for the problem. I was treated as though I had created the problem. 4:30am checking out was hampered again by long lines and the inability to print any receipts. They must have not replaced the broken printer from six days earlier. If it was a broken slot machine, I am sure it would have been fixed in minutes. It feels like this hotel is run by a bunch of amateurish, underpaid, unskilled staff. Everything was failing and they seemed incompetent to address the causes of the failures. Just a poorly run hotel. Stay away!"

    "content": "I stayed at Mandalay Bay for a long weekend. This resort is located at the airport-end of the Las Vegas strip, and encompasses two hotels (Mandalay Bay and THEHotel) and numerous restaurants, shops, pools, and nightclubs. ROOMS: I stayed in a King Delux room with a view of the strip. Well, it was more like a view of the airport... you had to move to the far corner of the room to see the strip. It was quite lovely at night. The beds were comfortable but a bit soft. The bathroom was large with two sinks and a soaking tub (which I enjoyed). The 'fridge was stuffed with overpriced minibar items and there was no room to put my own soda or beer. >: ( POOLS: The lounge chairs and towels were grubby and hard to get. Fri thru Sun you had to get to the pool by 10 am for any chair at all. The wave pool is great fun and was nice and warm. The lazy river is also great (floats extra) and there were some jacuzzis scattered about. I didn't go to the adults only pool but I heard it was a fun party scene. FOOD: Mix restaurant was excellent with a great view of the city. The food and service were superior. We also ate at Fleur which was tapas-style and had a diverse and delicious menu. Poolside food/drinks were pricey. Everything was pricey... GAMING: The casino looks more or less like every other resort casino on the strip with the same games. Bar in the middle also a fun night spot. SPA: Pricey, pricey. $45 for a manicure. The Cardio Room is paid for by your resort fees but if you want weights or mats you need to get a spa treatment or pay for Fitness Room access. Extra fees. There are other things to do, such as shop in the mid-range stores, see Lion King or the Shark Reef, and take the tram to Luxor. Overall, nice hotel and I did get a good rate for the weekend."

The standard rooms were average but we upgraded to a better room on the second night and it was also worth the extra money. It can be difficult to walk to the strip from the hotel as we only found 1 walkway and they close that frequently for special occasions. All in all it was just a little better than an average hotel."

Our ceremony was at the Valley of the Falls and our reception was in the Vista Suite. We had 32 guests and everything was absolutely delightful, beautiful, and went smoothly. The Valley of the Falls is a beautiful location to get married surrounded by water falls and exquisite architecture. The Vista Suite is a large 1700 square foot suite with many seating areas and a bar. It fit a large buffet table and servers comfortable with 32 guests. The view at sunset and into the evening was so great we did not need any additional decorations or flowers in the suite. Aleena Voeller was our wedding coordinator. Aleena coordinated every last detail for us over email. She thought of everything and ensured that every detail was perfect. Aleena was also present at our ceremony and coordinated everything from guest seating to tips timing down the aisle. We had a violinist and a pianist at our ceremony. The Valley of the Falls was decorated with flowers and rose petals, it was lovely. I highly recommend using Aleena as your wedding coordinator as she will make the entire planning process stress free for you. I also suggest the Valley of the Falls package at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino - the photo opportunities are magnificent. All of the staff at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino was helpful and gracious. Hotel also has free valet parking. The wave pool, lazy rizer, Shark Reef, and shopping onsite make the hotel practically all-inclusive for your guests. The Arc salon does professional hair and make up. The stylists are skilled and capable at achieving your specific wedding hair and make up. I highly recommend Mandalay Bay Resort, Valley of the Falls Package, Arc Salon, and Aleena be used for your wedding. :-)"

We found the location of the hotel was ideal, when we wanted to get away from the huge bustling crowds of the Las Vegas mid strip area we could retreat to the Mandalay Bay Hotel whilst still busy was not as packed or crowded as other locations mid strip. It was easy to get from the hotel to the rest of the strip, either a five minute free tram ride or a fifteen minute walk. Highly recommend the Mandalay Bay hotel to all."

    "content": "The hotel is ok, but there are super-serious issues leading to a 1-star rating. The Casino is dirty carpet, smoky and lame. The casino floor clubs have auto-tuners and totally lip synced fake music. The air is not clean on the casino floor (poorly ventilated, I dont mind smelling smoke, but the air here lingers and stinks). The foundation room and the Mix clubs are both lame and they are charging to go up, I just want to see a view, but they turn this into a nightclub thing, very stupid. The clubs are not worth being charged for at all. Pool area is neat. Not a bad pool at all. But there are towel issues and they even check bottled water for booze! Where the 1-star comes in is the unprofessional staff, the thievery, the lies and the cheating. The room rates have been going down slightly, but there is a catch. Some of the worst airplane-food is served at Raffles and the Red White and Blue, and they charge criminal rates for this food. The food at Strip Steak was mediocre, but the cost was outrageous and the service was completely unprofessional. We had a $800 bill for three people, and the service was rude and the food just ok. One server at Strip Steak spoke to a drunk couple while we waited for 10 minutes to order. Lupo is not very good, total sham for the price - Wolfgang Puck is known for frocery frozen food aisle junk. Fleur by Hubert Keller was ok, service was good, food just ok, but prices were outrageous. Aureole could be nice, but the prices are outrageous and the format of this restaurant needs work, its not an inviting place to go and have a few glasses of wine and an appetizer, they want to sell you a 9 course mediocre meal. It also closes way too early. China Grill, prices are outrageous, and this lame place isnt open for lunch and closes early. In fact, most places close early. Border Grill just stinks. Low quality food and outrageous prices. I really believe in freedom, liberty, and the free market - but the prices here are nearly criminal. Sure they can charge what they want, but its a fraud, they give you a \"deal on the room,\" and they have the convention center and drag us all into events here, but then they cheat overcharge and deliver bad food products for bad prices. The Ri Ra bar on the way to Luxor was the only good place in there, good fish and chips, beers were good, a bit expensive but not as bad as the rubbish in the Mandalay. The crepes place is no good, takes forever and is overpriced. Ice bar is completely lame. The seafood place, I forget the name, is lame, and has a prix fixe menu with venison on it in a seafood place. The prices were completely outrageous there as well. This hotel has huge potential, but its being run by greedy people obsessed with taking working family men like myself and shaking us down for every single penny in our wallets. The in room minibar is a total rip off and there is no room for your own stuff and there is a hyper sensitive item removal detector on each item so if you bump them while storing medicine you get charged and you have to dispute a payment for something you didn't even drink. The tubs are nice, but the shower is a low flow shower head which sucks. I'm letting hotels know something, if you put that low flow shower head in, I run the shower for hours to \"punish\" you for this. You'll rack up a years worth of water charges because you cheated me out of a decent shower. The walls here are paper thin, so if you get a spring break next door you are doomed. I just run water to down out the sounds. Raffles is the late night dining. The service can be good or super super slow its random. Food quality is airplane-food. The towel situation at the pool stinks. There are no moving (Jetson's) sidewalks on the way to the convention area. The convention area is like a half mile from the smell casino area , and walking there is ridiculous. The service in general here is terrible. The managers are no good, the dealers are rude, the bartenders are mean spirited. Ri Ra was good, but the rest were very annoying. Ri Ra's bar tenders are actually from Ireland. I really find the way this property is run to be offensive and below what should be for a potentially great hotel. The towels and the sheets and the other linens were smelling \"burnt,\" like very cheap detergent was used and the linen fibers were being burned by super hot dryer. The internet service was very spotty, it could take a long time to \"agree\", and transfer rates ranged from good to zero. A large number of employees have piercings and tattoos which are unprofessional and need to be covered up. I really think Mandalay has gone from interesting and nice looking with lots of potential to being a criminal fraudulent terrible place to stay at and to be at."

My overall stay was excellent, the room was clean, house keeping came 3 times in the 6 days i stayed, room was very quiet and tidy, technically i didnt stay in this hotel, but i stayed in a place called The Hotel which was part of the Mandalay Bay. Upon staying here i did get to meet a couple of celebrities as the boxing was going on... I soon realised now why they chose to stay at the Mandalay, its because its quiet, its right at the end of the strip and theres a back entrance where they can slip in and out of the hotel un-noticed. The poolside was awesome, it does tend to get busy and opens at 9am, buffet there is one of the finest place to dine, Concierge are so friendly and are always willing to help, the hotel is very spacious. Only disappointment is it being right at the end of the strip, however you do get a tram giving you access to the Luxor and Excalibur. Its also a 10min cab ride from the airport which will cost you roughly $18."

    "content": "I stayed at Mandalay Bay from May 5 to May 8 with a group of girlfriends for my bachelorette party. We were a bit nervous about our stay after reading some of the reviews on here but we had no issues whatsoever. I think some people like to find the negative in everything - all I can say is if you are in Vegas and you notice things like a slightly worn carpet in the hallway you are pretty lame and should probably be vacationing somewhere else. Our check-in took less than 5 minutes and we had no problems waiting for the elevator like some other people mentioned. I stayed at Ceasar's last year and I wouldn't stay there again - it is HUGE and very confusing to navigate. I was there for 6 days and finally by the 6th day I was starting to figure it out. Also, our check in took over half an hour and the rooms were nothing special. Mandalay staff were exceptionally nice and our room was gorgeous. Very clean! The bathroom was very nice - we had a pool view which was awesome. The restaurants were all excellent - we ate at the Bayside Buffett which had really good food and is a great value...only $15! The Ceasar's buffett was over $20 if I recall correctly. Raffles was really good as well and the prices were very reasonable. We also ate at Lupo which is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant...the food was exceptional. Our waiter was a tool and would take one drink order from one side of the table and then wander off for about 10 minutes...it took almost 25 minutes for us all to order drinks...and we were only a group of 10 women. He was very inattentive which is not acceptable at a restaurant of that quality...it wasn't a Denny's for crying out loud. But that was the only bad thing about that dinner...the prices were a bit steep ($35 and up for an entree and $100 for a bottle of wine) but well worth it for the meal. Even if this hotel was a Motel 6 I would probably still stay here if only for the lazy river...one word sums it up - perfection. We had an absolute blast in there! The wave pool was okay but the waves were about 8 minutes apart when we were in so we got bored...I heard it picked up eventually though. The pool was completely packed but we never had a problem getting chairs and we weren't down there until around 11 or 12 each day. There was at least 6 of us at each time and we always managed to find chairs together...provided, we did have to search a little bit. The shark reef aquarium was also very good and I would recommend going. It was $18 admission but the exhibits were awesome. One thing we were not happy about was the \"resort fee\" - $20/night! That is quite ridiculous to us considering it was for things like a daily newspaper (which we never got) and the cardio centre (which we never used - people actually go to Vegas and exercise?!?). And there is no way to get around the charges. The woman at the counter tried telling us all hotels in Vegas do it but when I said I was at Ceasar's last year and my fiance was at Luxor the year before that and neither charged a resort fee she got a bit flustered....it's a money grab for sure. It is also a bit of a hike down the strip so bring extra cab fare for sure but once you're dressed and out for the night you don't go back to your room anyway. Overall, our group of 10 women LOVED Mandalay and would definitely stay there again. Take the negative reviews with a grain of salt for sure - some people can't relax anywhere!!"

It is certainly large enough, with a kitchen, living room, en suite in one area and the large bedroom and bathroom in the other area.

I had to use the large combination coffee table/ottoman for this purpose and it did not work out that well. The room should really have a separate desk/work area. I believe a better use of the space would be to remove the chaise lounge in the bedroom or one of the couches in the living room and replace them with a proper desk. One other small pet peeve was that the bathroom towels were very worn and shredded/torn. I would have thought that at $400/night there would have been very plush towels. Also, one of the hand towel holders was loose and fell off while brushing my teeth. All in all the room seemed a little dated (notwithstanding the 4 flat screen tvs). The bedside radio/IPod dockign station did not work at all, nor was there any plug to plug it into the wall socket. I had room service a couple of times and the hamburger/sandwiches were just \"okay\", as was the service. I suppose I have been spolied by the Wynn/Encore room service, which is completely spot-on. I ate at several of the hotel's restaurants and will review them separately under their own category. The casino is very large and had a good over-all feel, as did the sportsbook. Although when I asked if one of the TVs (which was off) could be switched to a particular baseball game the sportsbook guy was not friendly nor accommodating, telling me I had to speak to a supervisor. Okay, no problem, tell me who the supervisor is? Instead of requesting that a supervisor come over, he expected me to fetch one down, not knowing who this person was. Eventually the supervisor showed up and turned the TV to the game with no problem. But there was a definite lack of customer service from the portly gentleman behind the ticket counter. Baggage department and Valet were top notch and were very kind and friendly. The pool staff were fantastic and very welcoming. The pool and beach were also great. A great place for kids. And there was enough room and separate pools to find space that was quiter as well. I would rate the spa as 8/10. The staff were great, including the manicurist. The shower room though was a little dated and a little dirty with old wet towels on the floor and the separate shower stalls not cleaned. The sauna was also not very hot; instead use the eucolyptus room, which was very good. I would probably stay here again if I could get a good deal, but with all things being equal I would return to the Wynn/Encore."

    "content": "Mandalay Bay is nice overall, the rooms are clean & newer but do show some signs of wear & tear to the furniture. One drawback is the location, it is the last major hotel on the south end of the strip so if you plan to go sightseeing anywhere on the strip be prepared for a long journey. The biggest problem I had during my stay were the elevators. On the night I arrived me and other guests waited at least 5 minutes to wait for one elevator in a bank of at least 8 elevators. When an elevator finally arrived the button for my floor (18) would not work, so I had to get off on another floor and wait for another elevator that had a button that was working. The next morning the same thing happened only worse - myself & other guests on our floor waited at least 10 + minutes for ANY elevators. Again, there were at least 8 available elevaors but apparently only one was working at that time. (it was 11:00am - checkout time so everyone was leaving their rooms) A large group of people accumulated so we developed a priority system of who would go first so we didn't all try to cram in at once. I was leaving to attend a funeral, and a gentleman was leaving to attend a wedding so the others were nice enough to let us on the only working elevator first when it finally arrived. To have a hotel that large & not have all elevators working for over 24 hours is inconvienent to say the least. There were no signs at anytime during my stay saying the elevators were out of order so I am not sure what the problem was or why it went on for so long without being resolved. At one point during the 10+ minute wait a housekeeper noticed the large crowd waiting & called the front desk to have all of the elevators reset or recalled. Nothing happened, but it was nice of her to try to help."

We headed up, to find a beautiful, clean, well laid out room, I was worried that because we hadn't booked a view of the strip that I was going to be overlooking a parking lot, instead, we had a fabulous view of the pool. We headed down for some dinner and WOW what a selection! There was something for everyone, burgers, steak, sushi, chinese, sandwiches, lots of variety, and everything we had was really tasty. The casino floor was busy, but not crowded, waitstaff was readily available, and everyone was friendly. Overall the hotel was great! I would definately return!"

The request was confirmed by the site and the down payment of the first night was made. When we came to check in the receptionist told us that there is global suite's overbooking and there for \"the hotel made me an \"upgrade\" to the suite in \"The Hotel\". Although the time was noon, he said that the suite is ready and we can go to our room. We never stayed at The Hotel, so gladly, we made ourselves to The Hotel direction. Well, the V suite is nothing to write about: gloomy, darky, tiny, and no Jet-tub, and the room we got had a view over the parking lot. Obviously, we went back to the MB reception, just to claim the original 700S suite. After some debating with the shift manager, he agreed to give us the requested room and even gave us the keys. Seconds later he told us that the chamber made is still in the room and in a few moments we'll get a call with the room number. After 3 ! hours of waiting I approached the reception again and was told that \"really, in few moments your suite will be ready. And no, until then we cannot give you your room number, sorry.\" Well, it took me another two hours of wait and at 6 PM I approached again the counter. This time I was given the room number and gladly went to see what I got. OMG. The smell of the smoke began about 30 feet from the room. When I entered the room I could actually hang a shirt on the smoke and stink that came from this suite. Obviously, I came down again to the reception and all the receptionist could say was \"It is a non-smoking floor, which means there can't be smoking room!!!\". \"But\" she added, \"I can send an ozone-machine to refresh the room, but it'll take at least 3 hours more\". This is the last suite available in the hotel and if I don't like it they have only one queen room left, so they will downgrade me to the smallest room in the hotel\". Well, I'll give them one good point after all: the shift manager agreed to reverse my down-payment, and so I entered the business room and got a nice suite in the Aria, asking myself \u2013 why in the might's name I didn\u2019t do it first place."

    "content": "I've stayed at manadaly many times in the past. I have always had a good experience...until this time. They made a major goof up. They gave access of my room to another guest. Luckily, I happened to be in my room (and fully clothed thankfully) at the time when they \"opened\" the door to my suite and walked right in. They stared at me and I stared at them. If I wasn't there, they could have taken anything I had laying around like my laptops which does not fit in the safe. I guess thats why you should always bolt your door. But you can't bolt it when you are away from your room. I spoke to the manager about it. She seemed sincerely apologetic and I let it go as just stupid human error. However, I did press her on how this can happen and based on what she told me I don't see how it can't happen again. Seems like their reservation system does not flag that someone is already checked into the room or there is some work around that lets you get pass it. Now I'm going to have to hide my stuff for the rest of the stay because I have lost confidence in them. Probably the last time I'll be staying here. As far as the suite goes, it was somewhat disappointing. Mandalay generally have very good rooms even the basic ones. The suite is just a larger version but compared to other suites that I have stayed at this one pales. Vdara for example, their suite has a washer/dryer and full kitchen. But the problem with the mandalay suite is that they don't even provide you with the basic top tier touches like a bath robe. The jetted tub however and nice view is a plus. I do like that mandalay is generally very clean and comfortable and I actually like that its further away from everything because its not as crowded."

    "content": "We were on a 10 day trip to America staying in New york and then moving onto Las Vegas. We decided on the Mandalay because of the great reviews of the pool area thinking we would want to chill out after a hectic time in NYC. The hotel is about the nearest main hotel from the airport and will cost less than $30 in a cab when you arrive to transfer (inc tip) and takes about 15 mins. Check in was excellent, although we were only given the option of three rooms we did have one with a strip view but only on the 8th floor. I had been led to believe the hotels in Vegas could be that huge to get to your room could take 15 mins, well here at the Mandalay in takes about 3. The lifts are located right next to the lobby, so no casino to traverse. The room was the basic level, but still was huge by our standards! The room has a king bed, 50\" plasma on the wall and a 15\" in the bathroom, a writing desk, 2 chaise loungers, a bath and a shower together with a seperate toilet. All in all the room was superb and god only knows what the larger rooms are like but I have to say why do you need more? The only gripe was there was no coffee making facilities, so tip number one is bring your own along. The pool area that we so much wanted to book the hotel for was the biggest let down. Maybe it is what us Brits expect, but lined up like sardines listening to blaring music all day is not my idea of good fun. The \"european pool experience\" ( I think this means quieter and more room) was provided in another area that you had to pay extra for, unfortunately it was shut. As was another pool area shut. This meant that the area open was heaving with people and not at all pleasant. I thought I would chance a jacuzzi in the afternoon, no thanks! About 10 people rammed into a small jacuzzi, it looked unpleasant and unhealthy to be honest. We stayed about 3 hours the whole trip and was a big let down for us. The hotel is part of the MGM group and so therefore about half the hotels on the strip are part of the same chain. If you join the \"M Life\" club in the casino then you can charge items to your room at any of the other hotels that include Luxor, Ballagio, MGM Grand, Excalibur. Worth doing to save you carrying cards around. Now a word on eating, a favourite hobby of mine. We ate at The Mix which is in \"The Hotel\" part of Mandalay Bay complex and the buffet in the hotel. I would say the difference is not in the quality of food (both are excellent) but in the service you receive. Obviously one is waiter service and one serf yourself. Price wise The Mix ($200 for 2 inc drink) was about double the price of the buffet ($90 for 2 inc drink) which seems reasonable. Clearly the food at the a la carte restaurant was very good and of a very high quality, but the food at the buffet was also very good and a great deal of variety was included. We decided to try the Ballagio buffet as a comparison and for an extra $5 each the gourmet buffet on friday and saturday which we were fortunate to stumble upon was of a higher standard than the Mandalay imho. This buffet at $38 each included sushi and a greater variety and what appeared standard of food. The buffet included Quail and duck for instance. Well worth a visit. Another favourite hobby of mine is drinking. This can be expensive!! As a rule expect to pay about $6 or $7 for a bottle of beer in a hotel, although there are ways to get this cheaper or even free!! Tip number 1 is look out for happy hour offers, in the Mandalay theHouse of Blues has a happy hour most days from 3pm to 6pm where a bottle is $2 for instance. They can be tricky to find in some hotels, and in the evening you are not going to find them. You can budget on a couple of drinks in the ballagio will set you back $20 including a tip. Tip Number 2 is use the slot machines to grab a beer. This can be daunting for first timers to get the hang of how things work, but once you work it out it is simple. Basically if you are playing a machine look out for a what is usually a busty scantilly clad lady carrying a tray, each girl has set rounds to look after. Catch her eye and ask her for a drink of what you want, or if you are with a significant other ask for two drinks. In about 10 mins she will be back with your drinks for free. Now on a couple of ocassions I was not playing the machine when she returned but that is not a problem, just hang around the same place and beer will be provided. You can see how this can be used to get your beers for the evening, especially if you enjoy playing on a machine anyway. Remember to tip the girl at least $1 a bottle to ensure a return service! The strip is a mind blowing place, you have heard of all the hotels and now is the time to go and look round them. They all want you inside them as you will be inclined to spend money!! You can walk through a lot of the hotels without ever going on the strip, usually through shopping malls. There is some of the finest shopping on the planet in Vegas, and if you like watches and jewels then the window shopping is as good as it gets. All the finest names have some of the flagship stores in Vegas so it is a great place to get immersed in what it could be like if you won the lottery! Walking from the Mandalay to the Stratosphere which is virtually one end of the strip to the other takes about 2 hours and well worth it. We went up the stratosphere and the views are amazing, this is worth a visit. We stayed for 6 nights, one of which we spent in the Grand Canyon. This was a 280 mile drive each way that took about 5 hours but was well worth it. The drive was superb for us brits who got the chance to see Arizona and Nevada a little more. You pass by the Hoover Dam so you can take in both at the same time. We hired a Mustang Convertible car for about \u00a390 for 2 days including a tank of fuel, great value for money. There is too much to review on here about the place, I think somewhere you should visit at least once in your life, but for us probably just the once. Have fun, and dont lose your house!! Lee"

The rooms were comfortable and clean (although one of our kids found a bra in a drawer and it was the source of great amusment and speculation for the two nights we stayed). The pools are perfect for kids who want a little time away from mom and dad. The wave pool was fun, but the lazy river was the highlight. And just walking around the pool area looking at all of the people seemed to be an adventure in and of itself. Loved our dining experience at Lupo - Wolfgang Puck's outpost at the Mandalay Bay."

    "content": "We asked for a good view and got the 32nd floor looking out at the maze of swimming pools and the mountains - no neon, so we didn't even feel like we were in Vegas which for us, was a good thing. The room with 2 queens and a sofa was spacious with a big flat screen. The bathroom was big with separate shower and bath (and another TV)! Free wi fi. Really good baggage service - bags came within 15 minutes and this is a BIG place. Free valet. Lots of restaurants on site. We were there 2 nights and never left the hotel and ate somewhere different each meal and they were all good. Our favorite was the Raffles Cafe. We ate there twice. It is listed as a quick eat, but it is really a very nice casual restaurant. Great food and service and less pricey than the others. Also removed from the casino element and not smokey at all. The swimming pool was the main reason we stayed here and it did not disappoint. However, I wish we had known that people line up starting at 8:30am (gates open at 9am) to reserve a poolside chair. If you are not in line by 9am, you will not get a lounge chair or any kind of chair the rest of the day - OK maybe you'll get lucky like we did and see someone leaving after lunch and grab their spot. You can reserve and pay $75 per chair for a cabana if you can afford it, but otherwise be prepared to sit on your towel on a small area of concrete or sand. Also wish I had known that they do not provide tubes for the lazy river - you have to buy them. They cost $20 each or you can bring your own. The lazy river is great and you do not have to use a tube - I would actually prefer it if they required it since this can cause accidents and much bumping of tubes into people. At lease all the pools felt slightly heated which I like. Hot tubs were great too. The most fun is the wave pool."

    "content": "This was our fourth stay at this hotel and first time in several years. I don\u2019t think I would go back as it didn\u2019t seem as good as it used to be. The only reason to stay here is for the pools so if that is your top priority (eg for kids) then these pools are the best. They have a wave pool with sandy beach, river pool and multiple regular pools and hot tubs. There is a nice half mile walking/running path that circles the pool area. The pool area is extremely busy and you must get a lounge chair early or it will be tough to get one. The loungers are packed in pretty close to each other. We rented a cabana for a couple of days which was pricey but great as you get some shade, more space, great service, plus didn\u2019t have to fight for a spot. The positives for me are numerous restaurants on site (pricey but nice), it is at the end of the strip so less busy (but a long hike to the action if you walk). It is connected by indoor walkways (and a tram) to Luxor and Excalibur so even more shopping and restaurant options. For me the downside of the hotel is that it is starting to show its age and the elevators were very slow and busy. At certain times of the day we often had to wait for a couple of elevators to come and go as they were full. Also, we found the beds extremely soft and uncomfortable. The pools are great but very crowded. In my opinion come here for the pools if that is your priority otherwise there are better choices."

    "content": "I stayed at Mandalay Bay main resort over Easter weekend with the intention of having a relaxing spa weekend. Mandalay delivered for the most part. The room was clean and comfortable. The pillows are a little hard but I didn't mind that so much. The bed itself was just right. The cleaning staff delivered fresh towels daily. The view from my window was of the roof below my room and the Luxor. Had I been on a higher floor it would have been nice but since I was on floor 4 i just saw rooftop. I didn't care. The spa service were great. Aromatherapy massage for 50 minutes is highly reccomended along with the Spring Refresher facial. The baths were lovely. Clean and well maintained. The room service agent was so nice and funny when I ordered breakfast for the following morning. I ordered a stack of pancakes and fresh strawberrys and they were delivered on time and were very good. The toilet in my bathroom was a little weird. It's in its own closet within the bathroom and the door slams behind you when you enter it which can be a little startling but after the first time using it I knew what to expect. On Saturday afternoon the elevators get a little packed and you have to wait for a few to go by before you can fit into one or if you're on a low enough floor (i was on 4) you can walk. No big deal. The pool complex also get very crowded and you can't find a chair if your life depends on it. But, check out the South Lagoon and you might have luck there. Front desk staff was helpful in checking in and checking out. One point of annoyance was the hotel puts a hold on your credit card for incidentals of $100 per day (includes the $20 resort fee)and what they don't tell you is once you have maxed out the amount of money on hold you can no longer charge items to your room. That was a little bit of any issue since I didn't want to have to have cash or credit cards on me at all times. I didn't learn this until i had hit my limit. I finally had to call guest services and they told me i had used my max and had to reopen another limit. Its treated like a credit card limit. Otherwise, a pretty nice stay."

However we were moved promptly and didnt have any further problems. The pool area is great though rather busy. However we always secured sunbeds. Although there are 8 lifts for the upper floors they are very busy and we regularly had to wait several minutes for one to arrive. Extras at the hotel are very expensive. There are no complimentart refreshments in the room and the prices of the drinks and snacks in the fridge are extortionate. Cabanas are several hundred dollars. Being at the end of the strip meant that everything was some distance away. The free monorail runs to the Excalibar which helps but this stopped running at 10.30 pm on some nights. Although it is a walk to the central strip it can be pleasant to be away from some of the hustle and bustle. The Resort Fee of $18 is unreasonable for wi fi, access to the fitness room and a paper (which you have to collect and isnt delivered). One would hope that these items would be covered by the cost of the room (and often are standard in many other hotels) and not be the subject of a (compulsory) additional charge. This just seemed to be a way to irritate guests who already are spending a lot of money in the hotel."

We booked the hotel because we thought its location and pool facilities would be the cleanest and friendliest place for our children. Boy ...were we wrong. Our first day there we took our three young children to the pool and we were in the lazy river when my oldest cried out he had cut his foot on something at the bottom of the lazy river. I was horrified to see blood pouring out of his foot. We had to yell at the lifeguard for help because he was not paying attention and were taken over to first aid where we were told it probably was not that bad and that even if it were she would not be aloud to tell us if he needed stitches or not. We proceeded to tell them they should clear the pool out and get whatever cut my sons foot out before someone else was harmed. THEY DID NOT CLEAR THE POOL OR WARN ANYONE! I am disgusted with the service we received and the lack of concern all of the staff seemed to have for my son and the rest of the guests well being. We got back up to the room and found that he was still bleeding and tissue was oozing from the inside of his foot. We called to get help and they asked what expected from them. They finally sent up security who gave us the names of some medical facilities we could take our son to. My poor son had to have stitches, our vacation was ruined and we had to return home the following morning. We asked if they ever found what cut my sons foot because my son has allergies and it is always a risk to give him new antibiotics and they told us they had not yet looked into it and that even if and when they did find something..we would need to get a attorney to get the judge to release the records from them. They did not care that in order for the Doctors to best know what route to take with meds, they would need that information. It has been five days, I have not gotten any answers. We have lost thousands of dollars in medical costs and trip expenses and we had to return home after the first day due to what happened. May I add, the service was horrible, had to request new towels and room to be cleaned the first day. And watch out, we were told we would have a strip view and were given a view of the front parking blocking the strip view and found we were charged a $20 a night resort fee!"

The service was terrible---waited for food by the pool that took over an hour, took an hour to leave as the elevators were overloaded an hour before check up time...(we took the stairs with our luggage!), the worst part was no chairs by the pool (whole point of staying) and could not get one for 2 days! No help either and they stand by the fact that they do not care about you getting a chair. If you want to pay for a cabana which price fluctuates $150-750 based on demand during the day (as do certin red chairs and umbrellas which sell out) then go ahead spend more... Way too crowded and worst service. Next time Four Seasons as the service there cannot be beat. Do not waste your time and money here."

Are wedding cordinator Haben and the wedding chapel was awesome. As for the rest of the hotel and even the manager Anna Siquera are the rudest people i have ever met in a customer service job. Over the 3 day stay i spent well over $10,000. To me i would think that would make them a little more helpful when things went wrong. 1st in the bar the bartender made drinks for a couple of people and me and my bridesmaid asked what he had just made. The bartenders (from eyecandy) response was I don't know and i will not make it again for you. Then i had confirmed with the front desk about a 2PM check in for the Hospitality Suite where our reception was. I sent my sister to get the keys at 2PM while i was taking my photos after the wedding (which the photographer is paid for by the hour) and the front desk said i had to go get the keys. I left my photo session because all my guest were waiting to go upstairs for the reception. When i got to the lobby i had to stand in line (with my wedding gown on) and wait to be seen by the front desk. Where i was then informed the room hadn't even been cleaned yet. My wedding party guest and all had to stand around and wait for the cleaning crew to finish. Finally at 3PM the room was ready. The next day I talked to the manager Anna Siquera about the problem. She then proceeded to tell me that everything was handled the way it should have been and pretty much in a nut shell told oh well. I spent the last 12 months away from my family and friends defending our country and just spent over $10,000 in your hotel and that is what you say to me. To me i would think at least offering a free 2 night stay, but in her eyes it was taken care of to standard. I would have loved to come back every year on my anniversary and stay at Mandalay Bay but after that i will never stay there again!!!"

    "content": "We had made reservations for 3 nights at Mandalay Bay back in October 2010 for 3 nights in April 2011 - fully 6 months in advance. Upon check-in, we were told that we had been \"upgraded\" to The Signature with one free night's stay. At first I thought \"Great - The Signature must be some special block of rooms or something.\" Uh - no. It was actually the timeshare building owned by MGM that is behind the MGM Grand. While it is \"connected\" to MGM, it's by a several hundred yard walkway with moving sidewalks that connects to the very back of MGM Grand. In reality, The Signature is fully three blocks off the strip. We immediately expressed our displeasure and stated that it was unacceptable. We had booked 6 months in advance with a deposit. After arguing through three levels of management, we finally got to a gentleman who said he was the manager of the whole hotel who finally agreed to bring us back from The Signature the second day. According to all we spoke to, we were bumped solely because we were only staying 3 nights, as were all staying a shorter duration than us. The date of our reservation did not matter. I am sure that the lack of my being on their record as a frequent gambler did not help either. Despite being given the free night it was still a severe crimp in our vacation as we had to travel all the way over to Signature for the first night, then pack back up and travel back over to Mandalay Bay at 11AM the next day to check in. At that point, we were unable to get a spot at the very busy pool, so ended up only using the pool facility one day. While The Signature was a very nice room and hotel, it was not what we wanted and was in a very inconvenient location. We are going to continue to seek further restitution from Mandalay Bay as we feel we were severely wronged and the free night's stay at The Signature was not acceptable to make up for the time we wasted and the broken promise of our \"reservation\". As to the hotel itself, our stay was very average. The pool was ridiculously crowded as were the elevators trying to get to our room. The Buffet was severely understaffed and not well managed, with only average food. Next time, I will return to Venetian, which I believe is a much better choice in Vegas, and is not owned by MGM Resorts, which clearly is not interested in keeping their promises."

Most of the staff was friendly, a little confusion at checkout and the business center (where you want to send your amazon packages prior to arriving) is a hectic and poorly run place imo. This hotel has some very pricey restaurants and a few reasonably priced. The beach, YES BEACH at this hotel is something else, apparently they shipped a couple of tons of beach sand from California to make their beach. A wave pool for all, a kiddy pool, a lazy river and an \"adult\" pool-club. The beach is for hotel guests only and I guess this pool area draws a lot of visitors in since this has been chosen Nevada's best pool-area a few times. I slipped the front desk clerk a $20 and got an upgrade from Standard Room to a Spa Suite. The jacuzzi really made the stay more enjoyable since the bathroom also has an lcd tv. The view from my room wasn't anything special, but most of your time in Vegas is spent outside your room anyways. The room was however very roomy and the bed and pillows were very nice!"

This is stupid, and should be included,especially with a Penthouse suite. Palazzo is much better, with access to its concierge lounge included, with breakfast, happy hour, snacks and late dessert. There is a penthouse lounge, but we just found out on Monday, nowhere in the check in brochure did we note access to that, and it is only open on weekends. Go to the Palazzo-much more for your money, and they contact you daily for needs, did not get one call from MB staff. Very indifferent, they could care less. Good breakfast buffet though, and a great Irish pub, Ri Ra, a outfit out of Dublin. Go there for the food, and avoid the China Grill, poor sushi, and the bartender offered to sell us drugs!!!

Of course we did visit the centre on many occassions but it meant I felt safe going out on my own during the day, Hotel was better than I imagined and the room was as requested. I like the hotels where there is a proper reception area and not just a casino when you walk throught the main entrance and this was one of them. The various pools were plentiful and very clean, though busy on some hot days, but only to be expected as it is why people with families stay here. Restaurants were fabulous and plentiful with a great variety. Dissapointed with the shark reef and not good value for money - we do have better, similar attractions in the UK. All hotel staff were very courteous and pleasant though it would have been good to have had a coffee maker in the room. Unfortunately, night 6 was a nightmare - a group of young adults, spread across the hotel and more specifically, in the room next door, started to make noise early on in the evening with very loud music and shouting - early so accepted that but when it continued at 2.30am and was not stopped quickly, despite several telephone calls to security, I did lose patience. Eventually with threats from security of them having to leave the hotel, the noise stopped arounf 4.30am. The following morning, I made a complaint to the hotel reception manager and was moved to a two bedroomed suite. This was really above and beyond the call of duty and made the rest of our stay extremely enjoyable - thank you Mandalay Bay - you are forgiven."

Room was spacious and clean, huge window over looking the strip (which i asked for at the desk), huge bathroom. Hotel is very close to the Airport, but we had no noise at all from the planes. We had nothing to complain about with regard to our room at all, but then for us it was just a base to explore Las Vegas! (oh, we didn't dare touch the fridge for fear of having to pay for something, so don;t even know what was in it!) Yes the hotel is not brand spanking new, but we in England are used to hotels being older and more quaint so maybe we do not find this a drawback! We used the Buffet for Breakfast one day (very good), Red, white & Blue for supper first night (ok), and drank in the Blues Bar one lunch time (had great time with some other travellers, from what i remember ha!) It is a long walk up the strip from The Mandalay, but we loved it and there is a bus stop right outside, the tram to the Excalibur and Cabs to if you want. The pool area is wonderful, but we only used it once as we were not here to sunbathe. I found the casino here to be very smokey, which i didn't like so we didn't stay around the hotel much. I would recommend this hotel, but would probably not stay here next time as i will try a hotel at the other end of the strip so we get to see a different part of Vegas! p.s. We didn't get charged any additional resort fee? but then our check out bill was zero as we didn;t use any addtional facilities )"

    "content": "The room itself was fairly nice with a decent view but not quite as great as I had expected from the Mandalay Bay. Although the bathroom was pretty big, the shower was TINY with a plastic liner that kept sticking to us. The bed was extremely uncomfortable and was just about the worst nights sleep I've ever had. It was far too soft and mushy. Soft is good but when it's too mushy your alignment is thrown off which doesn't lend itself to a restful sleep. The chaise lounges were dingy with feathers all over them. The mini bar works on a weighted system (thank God the guy told us) as we were terrified of throwing the weights off somehow and having a huge bill. I opened the fridge thinking I could put our items in there and it was packed with mini bar bottles so I panicked that the opening would register that we consumed something and slammed the door shut. It was rather comical! But I can't imagine staying in one of those rooms with children that love to touch everything. I think I would have to insist they had everything removed before we stayed in the room. I witnessed one of the bartenders at the Sports Book sneezing into his hand several times and continuing to stock items without washing them. Room service was quite good though. And the grounds are horrible for navigating by vehicle!"

Valet was professional and fast, check in was fast and very friendly - inviting us to a free concert the next afternoon at the beach (pool). When we found our room, we also found out that our comp room had been upgraded for us to a 750 GR style of room. We had so much space to stretch out and relax! The bathroom was one that I wanted to find a way to pack up and bring home with me - I absolutely loved the layout of it - and soooo clean! We took advantage of the free concert - Nickelback who did a warm up show before their real show that night at the MGM - they played all their hits and really did top off our stay! All in all the room was very clean and quiet, bed was comfortable, all the staff we encountered were friendly. If I had to find something bad to say it was maybe that the elevators were a bit slow at peak times but it wasn't enough to ruin our stay."

Houskeeping walked in about thirty minutes after we had been in the room to inspect it so we were checked into a room that hadn't been checked. Shortly after I went in to our restroom and saw hairs in the sink and bathtub. Yuck! I called down to the desk and they asked if I wanted it recleaned and I said yes. We left so it could be cleaned and came back 5 or 6 hours later...still not cleaned! I called back down to the desk and they asked if I wanted to move or have someone come up and clean. After being exhausted and not wanting to have to move...no I didn't want to and said I would clean it myself. That should have been a time for them to object , but no! The day we got home we noticed we have red bumps on us. I am praying it is not bedbugs!!! I will be calling the Vegas health dept. to check because I don't trust the hotel to do it themselves. If I wanted a dirty room with bugs I would have went somewhere cheaper!!!!"

Standing at a busy front desk, with suitcases and kids in tow, they knew I was trapped and couldn't walk away from the charge. What a rip-off. At checkout, I again inquired about the fee and was given a nonsensical explanation that obviously came off of cue cards, \"It is a resort fee implemented by our resort.\" That'd be funny if it didn't cost me $80. Mandalay Bay rips off customers because they know you're trapped. No, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone who values honesty and integrity."

To start off with they gave us a room with 2 queen beds vs a king. We called and were told it was based on availability, check back tomorrow and maybe they will have something. REALLY! The whole place is booked No rooms with a King! ... Ok so we just said forget it and kept the room. PROS: The room was big and nice view of the pool area. The pools looked amazing! We didn't use them though. The concert onthe beach was a BLAST! Will be looking into further shows there. CONS: The room is missing simple little things to make a nice stay. There is a refrigerator in the room and it is stocked. It is all weight sensitive, so if you touch or remove something you will be charged. So you can't use it. The have Krups single serve coffe in the room for $4 a cup. Come on... I like coffee and don't mean to sound cheap but really. So I went and baught a coffee pot and starbucks coffee and mugs. So now I have my coffee. I don't want to have to go down to the starbucks and back up for coffee. I like it when I wake up and relax in bed. The bathroom has the worst lights ever. If you wear make up good luck. The hotel is very far from the strip if you are walking. The have a tram thats is free, but only runs till like 10:30pm. On check out we had horrible service. I never felt like customer service was a priority. I like nice hotels and we are picky about CLEAN rooms. I only staff in nice places, but I will not stay here again. There are so many hotels to stay at. Do your research and find a place that cares about the guest."

Everything about this suite was PERFECT. Comfortable beds, air conditioning that worked well and doesn't disturb your sleep by turning on and off all night, 2 fabulous bathrooms with separate showers and jacuzzis, electronially controlled room darkening curtains covering floor to ceiling windows with a strip view, bar, flat screen TV's (even in the bathrooms), PLENTY of outlets, decent lighting, free wifi...I could go on and on. Rooom service was prompt and delicious. Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. The pool area gets crowded but there are some areas more quiet than others. We splurged one day and rented a cabana. What fun having our own waiter and host for the day not to mention the cabana with sofa, table, chairs, fridge, tubes for hte lazy river, free soda and water and more! We reserved the cabana 2 months ahead and paid 450 but if you wait until arrival you will pay $525-$750 depending on the day and weather. We enjoyed a fantastic and reasonably priced dinner at Auroele during their Happy House when wine and appetizers were 2 for 1! I would definitely stay here again. Note--my friend who is a regular said each bedroom in our 2 bedroom suite is just like a regular room at Mandalay Bay. Each bedroom was gorgeous and had the fabuous bathroom attached. I would be thrilled to stay in a regular room too but with 6 of us the 2 bedrom suite was awesome. You just can't ask for more..unless you want to be mid strip and step it up at notch at Bellagio!"

The wave pool area does get packed, but there are two or three other big pools, and we didn't have a problem finding a lounger. Our room (spa suite) was huge, and we loved the bathroom. We did have a sewage smell coming from the sink, but it was fixed pretty quickly, and it didn't bother us again. Our room was clean, although the sheets seemed kind of old, and could do with an upgrade. I thought the location was pretty good, it was easy enough to jump on the tram to the Excalibur, and from there it's a pretty quick walk to all the other hotels. I also enjoy walking in Vegas, so being at the end of the strip wasn't an issue. Had some fairly decent meals at the hotel itself, especially the Burger Bar (meat and veggie options). The hotel had a casual air about it, which I liked. Would stay there again--especially for that pool area."

We asked about it and there answer was there were not enough people to open other pools. After they tried to get us a seat they saw how bad it was and around 2:30 opened another pool.

    "content": "We went on vacation to Vegas and had heard good things about Mandalay Bay so we booked our room there. The room was relatively outdated considering our expectations for the hotel. The most disappointing part was the mattress. It was so soft that when one of us sat on it, it nearly folded in half. We are a fit couple so it is doubtful that we were beyond the expectations of a mattress. Additionally, it didn't even have a fitted sheet but 2 flat sheets instead. The bath towels had a very distinct odor of burnt plastic or rubber. We exchanged them with the housekeepers for a clean set but they too had the odor. In the shower there was mold growing in 3 corners. Our bed skirt was stained as was our lamp shade. Honestly, I think as far as room cleanliness goes, we have had better at a Super 8. On the plus side, pools were decent albeit over crowded. Checkout was easy. Beware each daily charge included a $20/day \"resort fee\" that was not initially included in our estimate. This includes the cardio room but not the gym. If we had wanted to use the gym it would have been an additional $25/person/day. There are great restaurants there and the tram is easy to catch north past Excalibur and Luxor. I'm sure had the room not been so sub-par our impression would have been much better. That being said, we won't be staying at Mandalay Bay again any time soon."

    "content": "Spent 5 nights at Mandalay in March 2011. Was really looking forward to it, and was only a little unsatisfied by small, niggly things. First to the positives. The rooms were fantastic. Wife, 2 kids & i in a 550sq suite. Beds are super comfortable. The room was very clean. The tv very good, and the tv in the bathroom a nice touch and encouraged the dirt magnets to actually WANT to take a bath. Vegas is not really a good place for 8 year old twins, but the wave pool at Mandalay sure is. The kids spent hours each day there. There are heaps of life guards around and they are all friendly. Drinks at the pool bar are quite pricey, but you expect that. The lounge chairs are really piled close together, but that\u2019s not a bad thing if you are surrounded by gorgeous bodies. The downside to this place is the gaming floor. It is soul less. The bars are dull, uninviting and expensive. The waitresses are utterly hopeless. My record waiting for a drink while playing the slots was over 40 minutes. Once, while waiting over 20 minutes for some one to approach me, and finally taking my order (though I had to explain 3 times what I wanted \u2013 is an Australian accent that hard to understand?), I watched in amazement as she walked past me twice with my drink. I never did get it, and had to go to the bar to get a drink myself. I can understand if the place was packed, but it was 1am on a Monday night and there were very few people around. I had heard the waitresses could be like this, and was disappointed to see the rumour confirmed. If you like playing poker, don\u2019t come here. Bellagio is the place, or the Casino Royale which is really good fun. Even Luxor was better than Mandalay for poker. Another gripe that made my wife so angry she has written a formal complaint, was that during our check in, we were not notified that we had received to buffet breakfasts. 2 x breakfasts x 4 is a big saving, and we had to go out to eat, costing around $100.00. We were notified that we were entitled to our buffet breakfasts while we were checking out! Other than that, I DO recommend Mandalay Bay. Sure, it is a hefty walk to the main action, but an easy stroll to Luxor and Excalibur. Being away from all the drunks and low-lifes at 3am is maybe not a bad thing. The wave pool area is fabulous. I didn\u2019t check out the other pools other than walking past them (they looked ok, but not in the main action), and we couldn\u2019t go into the adult pool as we had the kids. And seeing the prices for Moorea, I don\u2019t think I missed out on anything. The rooms are a great size. We were offered an upgrade for an extra $200 a night, which needless to say, I politely refused. The 550 rooms are big and nice enough and more than comfy. The staff are very friendly and helpful particularly when getting your car or hailing a taxi."

    "content": "When this hotel opened about 10 years ago, I remember visiting the casino floor and it used to be absolutely packed. Now when I went, it was noticeably more empty than other newer casinos such as the Venetian or the Wynn. Disregarding this observation, here's my experience of my stay this time. I was in town for a conference and was here for a week. Checked in at the front desk, but as with other Vegas hotels the walk from the self-parking lot to the front desk is a long distance through casinos and resturant areas. Check-in was not really a problem, but when I asked if I could pay for the gym pass there, they told me I had to go to the gym and do it there...not the most convinient. I had a standard room which was normal in size for a Vegas room with flat panel TVs in the bedroom and in the bathroom area. The room also featured a small sitting area and a working desk. The room had both wired and wireless connectivity, but both had some issues as the connection was really slow. The room was apparently located near one of the doors that the service people use and I could hear the door they use slam when i was in my room. My first gripe is with cleanliness and housekeeping. I proceeded to lie down on the bed and relax, but then found a bunch of long strands of hair on the bed which was obviously left from a previous guest. This had me questioning the cleansiness of other parts of the room. I looked in the shower stall and found it to be wet (don't know from cleaning or the previous guest). I had other issues with housekeeping as if you happen to have the \"don't disturb\" sign when they come to your room, don't expect it to be cleaned that day. I had the sign up on my room at times when I was in there, but even if I left for the majority of the rest of the day, my room would not be cleaned. At least they should call your room to see if you want the room cleaned that day or not. My next gripe although minor is with room service. Although fairly prompt and friendly, it was expensive ($40 for breakfast, juice and coffee) and not flexible (couldn't get bagel instead of toast in one of their breakfast set). The food itself was nothing special, and for the price they charge it should have been. Other things I saw around the hotel tells me this place is not up to the deluxe rating they claim. One of the elevator buttons on the floor I was staying at was broken (somebody busted it inwards) and it remained that way for several days. I saw several room service carts that were left outside in the corridor and weren't taken back although I saw service people pass by it many times. So to summarize, due to the service level I got, the uncleasiness of the room I would rather stay at other establishments in Vegas for the price."

    "content": "I attended a tradeshow with a number of business colleagues. We were booked into the Mandalay Bay but on checkin were upgraded to TheHotel. The Mandalay hotel is very large and with TheHotel located in the far corner of the property you will need to quickly learn the shortcuts (one of which involves going out TheHotel's garage entrance and then walking left to re-enter the hotel). The \"room\" was a very nice and spacious suite. Every room has a TV including the bathroom. The toilet is also a small separate area from the main bathroom itself which I can see would be useful when traveling with the family. Also, a complete separate bathroom is located right next to the main hotel room door. Lots of closet space. The bathroom is very large with 2 sinks and a bath tub and separate glass enclosed shower. Again, very nice. Lights are everywhere. The only downsides for me given that this was a business trip is that the Internet access is very slow and very variable (the first day was fine the other days poor to very bad). There doesn't seem to be internet access in the main common areas of the hotel (which I guess makes some sense given the casino). Staff was very nice and the room was cleaned and serviced each day in the early afternoon. The other \"nit\" is that you had better bring cash. Forget about using a casino ATM. The fees start at $9.95 for cash up $50 and then increase with the amount of money taken up to something like $1,000 (when it becomes a flat 3%). That just doesn't make any sense. TRICK: The House of Blues has a reasonable ATM next to the restrooms. At the time of this writing it was a flat $3.99 (plus your bank fees) regardless of how money you take. I have no idea why a hotel casino property would make it so difficult to get cash. For me the King Size bed mattress was a bit too soft and so my back did hurt. Others may not feel the same way. The hotel is close to the airport and access in and out is very easy. Tram access to the Luxor and other hotels as well as access to the main strip is quite easy. I took advantage of the Mandalay Spa and was able to make a reservation very easily. The massage was great and the overall ambiance and service was great. Very clean facilities. They also have a hot/warm set of pools for lounging and relaxing (which you get to use if you purchase a service; otherwise you can purchase access separately). Very nice if you have a late flight and want to relax instead of sitting at the airport. The spa in TheHotel closes early in relation to the main hotel (at least as of the time of this writing). The Hotel complex has a number of top quality restaurants and night clubs. Some of which I have separately reviewed."

    "content": "We've stayed at a lot of hotels on the strip and I had always heard how great the pools are at Mandalay Bay so we decided to stay here for the first weekend of March Madness this past week. We arrived on Thursday at around noon and we were able to check in a bit early. The check-in process went pretty quickly but we arrived at a time when there weren't many people there. We got to the room and were very happy with the size of the room and the bathroom. We had a view of the pool and 2 queen beds, which were very soft. The lighting in the room was pretty weak and we had to turn all of the lamps in the main room on and off individually. There was a large mirror in the entry way but my wife complained that it was pretty much useless since the lighting above it was so poor. There was a large flat screen HDTV and a desk area in the main room. We could tell that the furnishings were showing a bit of their age and the bed was getting a little old and was way too soft, but overall it was a pretty comfortable room. We were able to sleep pretty well except for some loud banging and some nearby hollering at 5 AM but it didn't continue long enough to have to call the front desk and it's the type of thing you'd expect to hear in Vegas. The bathroom was pretty nice with a double sink, a separate shower from the bathtub, a toilet in its own closet, and a small TV. There was a double-door entry to the bathroom that left a couple inch gap where you can see into the bathroom from the main room which might be a nuisance if you are sharing the room with friends. Our view was south towards the pool area, which was the main reason why we stayed at the hotel. It was only around 72 degrees on the only real \"pool worthy\" day of our 4 day trip and the pool was completely jam packed. I can't imagine how crowded the pool would be on weekends or during the summer since it was a Friday afternoon and it took us forever just to find an open chair, and we happened to get lucky to catch a group leaving their spots on our second lap around the pool area. We had a great time at the pools in the wave pool and the current pool and the kids there all loved it so if you bring your family they'll be very happy. I spent a lot of time at the sports book which was a pretty good one although the bartenders at the bar there leave a lot to be desired. Very slow and poor service but out on the casino floor the waitresses earned their tips a lot better. My wife gambled mostly at the slot machines and had a nice time but preferred the machines a lot more on our last two trips that were at the Wynn and at Aria. We headed out a few times to some other casinos and restaurants and found the location a bit distant from the rest of the strip, and it took a while to get anywhere either by using the trams or by walking. We prefer a more centralized location and a hotel that's closer to a few more restaurants. We ate at the Buffet which was OK and at Red White and Blue which had decent burgers/pasta. We also saw The Lion King on Saturday night and it was a good show. We had a really nice time and if you don't mind being a bit removed from the main part of the strip, it's a great choice. I would consider staying there again but we might give The Hotel or the Four Seasons (both of which are also on site) a shot on our next trip."

Even though paying top dollar for a room due to a 2500 person convention, I got a room that I wanted with a beautiful North view of the strip.. You would expect with the airport across the street, you would get no sleep, but I never heard anything the short few nights I was there. The room was modern with a mini bar, two TV's, exceptional washroom, two way internet connection, and a nice chair combination to just sit there and take in the view. there was lots of room with the 550 Sq ft floorplan.The hotel itself is tasteful , the casino is not obnoxious, and it attracts the right demographic. The only poor thing with the room was the quite terrible vanity lighting and no ventilation. Other drawbacks was the one ended strip location, the confusing valet system, and the typical MGM/Mirage resorts style of having to pay for what should be complimentary ammenities, ie coffeemaker. Also make sure to keep your pants on because housekeeping will visit everyday, and they don't waste too much time with knocking! I had good luck at this resort and feel it is a safe choice."

    "content": "Mandalay Bay was a beautiful hotel with horrible customer service. I stood in line to check, with only three people in line, it took almost 45 minutes to get my room key. I was told by the clerk I was in the wrong Mandalay Bay. I had just had my car valet parked and gave my bags to the bell men. When I went to see what I could do about my bags and car. I was told that it would probably be \u201ceasier\u201d to drive to the other Mandalay Bay. I said I was trying to eat dinner and make it to the Lion King, which is at Mandalay Bay. Too bad, because it would take at least 45 minutes to transfer my bags to Mandalay Bay from The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. Well, that would take too long, so I thought, so I got my bags and my car back. Tried to get directions to the real Mandalay Bay; not good. I ended up at Mandalay Bay the shopping center. No worries, I finally arrive at the real Mandalay Bay just to find a line of about 15 cars waiting to valet park. So, I thought, I\u2019ll just self-park. Guess where I ended up, you guessed it, the first Mandalay Bay I went to. I was sooo pissed at this point. I parked, got my bags, walked through the casino to my room, (it would have been nice to know that the walk was not long before I got my car back) ran to eat dinner by sitting at the bar at some burger restaurant, scarfed down the food and made it to the show. Early the next morning, I left to drop my daughter\u2019s team off on UNLV. I ran back between games. I asked the valet if he could not take my car back because I was just going upstairs to grab my bag. He didn\u2019t even look up and said \u201cNo\u201d, my car would be gone by the time I come back and it would take at least 15 minutes to get it back. So, I snatched my keys back, parked by the registration, ran up and got my bags and drove off. He could have told me I can\u2019t not take your car back, but just park right there and you\u2019ll be fine. Bottom line, don\u2019t stay at the Mandalay Bay unless you want to deal with a nasty attitude by the staff, poor customer service, and the worst set of directions known to man. It took me over 2 hours before I finally got to my room. No one provided me with good customer service. I have been to several hotels in Las Vegas and around the country. Mandalay had the worst customer service at of all the hotels and motels I have stayed at. I will never stay there again and will definitely tell anyone who will listen not to stay there either!"

We had just a standard room which was just perfect for us- as all you do is really sleep in there. We had two massive beds, great view of the strip and very large bathroom (room 21-217). The cleaners were fab and our room was cleaned every day of our trip along with beds being made and clean towels being left. We jumped on the tram every day to go up to Excalibur (which is free). And then walked to the rest of the strip or jumped on the monorail at MGM ($12 for day ticket). Walking was not bad espicially cause there is so much to see and do. Definately recommend a comfy pair of shoes aswell. We used taxi's a lot aswell especially in the evenings if you were going to just one place. Had so much fun in the casino- we were beginners at most games and the casino workers took alot of time to show us how to play the tables. We used a few restaurants at Mandalay- Strip steak AMAZING!!!! Raffles Cafe was very nice for lunch. Red, White and Blue- Standard nothing special. House of Blues was fantastic. And the Buffet was really good and had a great selection. We never used the beach or pool (just different have the time) but they looked amazing!!!! Concierge were fantastic really helpful when booking our trips and printing our passes. The bell desk were also brilliant and really helpful. The shark reef was good especially for kids. I recommend the ice bar- great fun and good experience. If your looking for a spot of shopping I really enjoyed the Ceasers Palace Forum Shops. Had so many to choose from."

The check-in took forever, the agent didn't even pay attention to my credit card and called it a debit card, and gave me some long speech. Once I finally got to my room, it was pitch black and the light switch was difficult to find. Lighting in my room was terrible in front of the mirrors, especially the bathroom. The room was dirty, furniture chipped and marred, hair in the bed, the shower, the tub, the toilet closet. I was afraid to take a spa bath because of what may greet me from the jets. I found a hang tag from a sex toy peeking out from the bible in my nightstand. Most of the towels were brand new and not washed, and there wasn't a towel bar at the vanity for my hand towel, however there were plenty of dusty shelves available. I had to call down to see why my mini bar wouldn't open, and was informed I would have to go back to the front desk ( I was on the 28th floor and had been flying all day with a 4 hour time change) and give them my credit card again, as it was only taken for room and tax at check-in!!! My associate had a similar experience with his room, and had even more hair in his bed. He reported the issue and instead of asking to clean the room, they immediately offered to take $75 off the room- which when the company is paying for it anyway, really doesn't help matters. He asked them to clean the room and still found hairs after they were done. I did NOT walk into my room searching for any of these things, they were all quite obvious and I don't understand how the housekeeper missed them unless she just wasn't looking. They didn't offer express check-out, instead you had to check-out on your TV or fill out a your key packet and drop it in a box in the lobby. I left on the 24th and still haven't seen my receipt yet, even though I asked for it to be e-mailed. I contacted the hotel and was greeted with a recording after 20 rings that said to go online to request a receipt, and found that part of their website was broken. I called back and got the same message, waited, and pressed the option to speak with someone, it rang a few more times and said they were closed, it is 3:30pm there, not sure why they were already closed! I would never ever stay here again, and I will actively dissuade others from this horrible place."

    "content": "Stayed at Mandalay Bay this past weekend. The common areas are nice and the standard room is quite large. I liked the large bathroom with a separate toilet area. Most everyone who assisted us during our stay was very pleasant. Decent selection of restaurants and the connectors to other hotels (Four Seasons, THE Hotel and Luxor) and the mall are convenient. Saw the Lion King at the theater there and it was great. Since it was so cold in Las Vegas this weekend it was really nice to just go to the theater and dinner and not have to go outside. A couple of things that would cause me not to stay there again... 1) Although the room wasn't filthy, it could definitely have been cleaner. There was a ring of grunge around the handles in the sink. I was able to take a wet washcloth and \"chip\" away at some of it so basically, it's happening because the maids aren't paying close attention. Went to make a phone call and the phone is the room was dirty with some lovely black, facial (I hope) on the cradle of the phone. Yuck! 2) The most important reason I would not stay at this hotel again though is because of the terrible sleep quality. The mattress was not in good shape at all and it offered almost no support. I had a backache after sleeping on it and my husband, who was having back problems to begin with was in terrible pain after our stay. We had a king sized bed and the pillows were very small and there weren't many of them. The worst thing though is that the rooms provide no insulation from sound and people come in at all hours of the night. I guess you can expect that in Las Vegas, but the noisy guests have absolutely no respect for other guests. Noisy guests are not necessarily the fault of Mandalay Bay, but the construction of the rooms is such that you can hear everything."

We also had dirty beds upon checking in which when we informed them they simply came by and dropped off new sheets. We had to change our own sheets the first night just to get clean beds. Nothing was taken off our stay there, no offer for getting the room cleaned, nothing. The hotel is nice, but with a dirty room and additional costs for minimal things that are simple customer service items I was not that impressed."

Additionally, there is a $20.18 resort fee added daily to the room charge, which is not disclosed if you make an internet reservation. The hallway carpets are worn, stained, and room service trays are not picked up timely. The pools were closed, and the tram had limited hours of operation during the week.

A large flat screen TV in your room, expensive great quality sheets and depending on your room great views of the strip. The hotel is huge with a large casino. Be aware that there is a resort fee of around $20 per day over and above the nightly rate but you are informed of this when you book online. The best deal we got was by booking directly with the hotel online. Sometimes it's better value to make two bookings even if your dates are back to back. The in room mini bar is expensive and weighted which means that if you remove an item even temporarily you are liable to pay for it. I understand that if you use the coffee facilities in your room it's about $6 per cup. If you want to eat here, go to the Bayside buffet which is beside the casino. It serves excellent food, reasonably priced, as much as you want. They also do a day pass for $43 which will cover breakfast, lunch and dinner. On Sundays they do a champagne brunch - yummy!!!! I would highly recommend this buffet. Also, if you need to print out your on line check in card for your return plane journey, go to the concierge who will do it for you free of charge. There is also free parking but the car park is hard to find so ask the hotel to email directions to you in advance. The hotel is at the end of the strip which is nice because you are away from the hub bub. If you want to go to the strip you will need to take a tram which is free of charge and then take the monorail $12 return. Get full directions from the hotel about where to pick up the trams and mono rail before you go. The mono rail stations also have a map. The stations are very difficult to find and when on the strip it can feel like a maze when trying to find stations which can be really frustrating. The Mandalay Bay resort is a very well managed well organised five star hotel. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!"

We received a players club offer for 2 complimentary nights and the third night at a $59.00 rate, plus $50.00 in free play and 2 for 1 show tickets at any MGM property. We took advantage of the ticket offer and saw the KA Cirque Du Soleil show at the MGM Grand. It is a must to see show, fantastic performers, moving stage with great music, special effects. We arrived at the hotel around 12 noon from the airport, check in was a breeze. The girl that checked us in was very nice and knowledgeable about the hotel. She gave us a non smoking on the 12 floor over looking the strip. A great view at night! Our room was decent with a large 42\" flat screen TV (great reception). There was also a smaller TV in the bathroom area. The bathroom had a tub and separate shower, plus double sinks. The toilet had it's own area with a private door. The room furniture was showing some wear with nicks and scratches, but over all the room was nice and clean. One small problem was with the shower drain, if you took a long shower it would back up a bit while draining. I made mention of this when we checked out. We enjoyed the casino playing slots. A nice selection of slot machines. The cocktail waitresses are the best, always coming around to see if you need a refill. They work hard, so we always tip. We ate one night at the \"Burger Bar\" restaurant in Mandalay Place between Mandalay Bay and the Luxor. A nice place, good food, good beer selec- tion. Mandalay Bay is on the far south end of the strip, but they have a free tram to take you to the Luxor or Excalibur Casino's. You can also catch the bus out front which we did and go in either direction. We went farther south to Town Square one day for some shopping and dinner. Lot's of great restaurants here (Claim Jumper's, Yard House, Bar Louie's, Miller Ale House, Tommy Bahamas, etc. to name a few). Check out was easy, checked out around 10:00 am on Thursday. Everyone we en- countered at Mandalay Bay was nice. The maid service was excellent. Airline boarding passes were free at the business center next to the concierge. This was included in the daily $20.00 resort fee, along with with in room wireless internet, cardio room access, daily news paper and local phone calls. My only negative is the resort fee they charge. We enjoy going to Vegas about 4 times a year. The rooms at Mandalay Bay are getting close for a make over. I like staying at different hotels in Vegas and have seen worse. So I would not hesitate to stay at Mandalay Bay again. Had a comfortable and pleasant stay."

I was very pleased with everything from ease of check in to the comfort of the room. I was afraid that I would have a plain,small, smelly room because I hadn't chosen the larger pricier rooms and ,unfortunately, I have not been able to quit smoking. The room was spacious and had only a faint odor of smoke. It was nicely appointed. The bathroom was huge by hotel standards. The view was spectacular. When I wasn't visiting all the casinos with my sister, I was parked in front of those floor to celing windows enjoying the view. The staff was friendly and eager to please. It was rather sad to see the number of shops that have closed at Mandalay Place. Had a fantastic Burger at the famous Burger Bar and the bartender made me feel very comfortable with the fact that I was eating alone (hadn't surprised my sister yet). My only complaint is that the room had no coffee maker other than a one cup ($4 for the disposable cup and not sure how much extra for the coffee itself) Kreuger coffee machine. What happened to the good old days of small drip coffee makers in the room? At any rate, it was a great hotel and I will happily return there."

If I were to complain about anything it would be the wait for the lifts, sometimes you could be waiting about 15 minutes to get downsairs. It was quicker to go up then back down again - I put this down to it being so busy in the run up to New Year. The House of Blues is an nice place to eat. There are plenty of bars and restuarats to go to - even a tatoo parlour! Casino staff were quite friendly (tip them well) . The Hotel prices were much like the others, the resort fee is steep but then it is one of the better hotels. All in all I was very happy with our stay here. As far as the location goes, it is fine. There is the walkway between Mandalay, Luxor and Excalibur, then you are at the four corners, takes ten minutes, very easy."

    "content": "We have been traveling to Vegas annually to see George Strait at MGM on Super bowl weekend. I try to find a place at a decent price and prefer to try new places each time. This years winner was Mandalay Bay. Our weekend rate was an average of $140 a night. We were charged a $15 daily resort fee which was announced in my email and at check in, I don't think that's been pointed out before. The resort fee included in-room wireless internet, cardio center access, daily newspaper, local and 800-number calls, outgoing faxes, boarding pass printing, plus a coupon good for 2 free well drinks per room per stay at select casino bars. Check in was very smooth, we got an option of a couple of rooms. We chose a king bed on the 8th floor at the end of a hallway. I didn't think of it until we were walking to our room that we should always request a room at the end of the hallway. It is actually quieter as less people are walking by your room...duh! The rooms' decor and lighting are my only complaints. The decor is ok, it's just bland. Everything is in neutral colors. There is a light switch at the door, but it is very faint and we had to search the room in the dark for more light. It may be because they are fluorescent ones that need time to brighten up. Otherwise, we had a nice comfy bed, flat screen TV, desk, and a couple lounge chairs. The bathroom was pretty big with 2 sinks, a shower and a nice soaking tub. The toilet was in it's own separate little room with a door that springs shut and absolutely no ventilation. I kept calling it the dungeon. It was pretty quiet being at the end of the hallway, but we had a room facing the airport and could hear some planes and helicopters taking off in the morning. I'd rather wake up to that than guests being loud in the hallway. Service seemed to be pretty good overall. We asked questions a couple of times and the people were helpful. We didn't gamble much, I just played slots a little. We watched a college basketball game in the sports book. I was more interested in watching all the people place their bets for the super bowl and the big UFC fight that was there that weekend. Since we were staying at the hotel that was hosting the UFC fight, there were fighters spotted walking around the casino on Saturday. We ate at the Raffles Cafe for breakfast one morning. It's a huge place, service was pretty good, the food was just ok, not really any better than a Denny's. The coffee isn't that good either, I had to get a Starbucks afterwards. We also ate at Hussong's Cantina. Again, the food is nothing to write about, but the Pepino Margarita is delish! The location is on the south end of the strip, which is ok if you are planning to stay on that end. We did, however, walk from there to the Mirage one night to have dinner and see Love (great show by the way). It took an hour at a pretty brisk pace. We took a taxi on the way back though. George Strait was at MGM and we took the hotel tram to Excalibur, walked over 2 walkways and was there in no time. I would stay here again if the price was right. I don't think any room in Vegas is worth paying a lot for when there is so much competition."

The rates are good especially when compared to some of the newer hotels. I was in the 550DR which is one of the smaller rooms, but was plenty roomy for one person. The bath was very large and well laid out. My biggest gripe was the totally expensive food at the restaurants. I guess the days of great deals on meals in Las Vegas are gone, at least at the big name hotels. Overall, I'd call my experience good, but not rememberable."

What we like: hotel and pool area are beautiful, views of strip from room are great, variety of meal/bar options, can usually find great deals (we paid $100/night including the buffet and spa credit!) What we don't like: location, spa (great for services but no place to relax and just hang out)"

We loved the coconut smell when we arrrived, our room was on the 31st floor and it was nice and comfortable. The tropical theme was pure heaven for us as we are from Long Island, NY and left right after our last major snow of 19\"!! We totally enjoyed the \"strip\" and we are familiar w/Vegas and know that there's a lot of walking that has to be done. We took the trams and then walked and enjoyed the sites of Vegas. Stopped at the hotels...drank and ate. We also saw Cher in concert and she was just amazing!! The Lion King was wonderful too. We also went to Minus 5 and enjoyed the Ice Lounge - great experience - we did the VIP Package w/2 drinks and photo but were having so much fun that we bought a 3rd round!! All in all we loved our Vegas romantic get away. Loved Mandalay Bay and would absolutely return for another visit."

Due to the close proximity to the airport the constant engine roar of planes taking off with late evening flights and early am flight activity actually caused us to lose sleep . We do not recall hearing such bad noise when staying upstairs at Four Seasons. Perhaps the windows here are not as good? Anyway, this is a very nice casino and hotel but be aware of noise issues. Also, be aware that the wave pool and other pool areas are closed in the winter. They do have one small pool at farthest part of outdoor area that is open with limited hours."

The bathroom has a very unfunctional design.

    "content": "Just got back from a 5 day stay and we enjoyed it. Here's tips for you to get more out of your stay: 1. Know in advance the fakery of the charges for the fitness center. ... There are some 3 layers of charges!. First there's the resort fee of $20/day. That let's you use the pool and cardio fitness center (nice tread mills & ellipitcals). BUT if you want to lift weights also it's $15 more (done with the BS of having to join the Spa where the weights are). Even then, there's an extra $10 (?) charge if you want to use the locker in the Spa. ... So I paid the extra $15 for the weights and DID like it (great facility). But having to go through the constant discovery of the extra charge BS is irritating. ... Now that you know in advance go ahead and plan on spending the money if you like weights. TIP: The hallway by the weight room has apples and fruit in a bowl. I grabbed two apples for a healthy and \"free\" lunch. 2. Free drink cards aren't worth much. ... We got these at sign in. But they're only good in the casino area where the drinks are already free (if you're betting). Don't do what I did. I tried to use the free drink card at the pool area. I ended up paying $12 for my \"free\" drink. The small type of the drink card tells you where the drink is \"free\". 3. You CAN easily print your airlilne boarding pass for free. ... Use the guest computers next to the concierge. You do NOT have to pay the $1/minute internet use charge. There's a big blue click-on box that tells you this on the screen but it's easy to miss (because I didn't know to look for it). 3."

Directly in front of the foyer, to the left, the living room: wrap around couch, club chair,corner table, and coffee table,flat screen TV,on top of a console table.To the right a round dark wood table with dining chairs, a floor lamp arced over the dining table. A glass and wood bar, sink and fridge complete with wine glasses, wine bucket, and tongs were on the bar counter. Assorted sancks were displayed on a WEIGHTED tray! If you MOVED the items YOU WERE CHARGED...same for the fridge! Double glass door lead to the bedroom s on either side of the living room and dining room.The floor to ceiling windows wrapped around the entire length of the suite. (from one side of the bedroom through the living room to the second bedroom) The view was breath taking! The entire STRIP, the mountains and the airport were the views. The electrical controls to the blinds and curtains are located on the walls! Entering into the carpeted bedrooms, a full length chaise lounge and lamp..for reading or enjoying the view and 'live' action of STRIP below! A king sized bed, dresser, night tables,and large closets complete the room. Again, double door lead to the marble, glass and stone bathrooms. The double sinked bath rooms had flat screen TV in the mirrored vanity wall, large soaking tub, walk in shower, and seperate toilet area. The check in process was easy.The expansive marble foyer void of any seating. The hotel was once very grand.It is tired looking compared to the 'newbies' on the STRIP. The furnishings are worn, the sheen is missing, the 'old world' charm is not 'chic. However, a QUIET experience with good food , excellent buffet,excellent end of STRIP location,...Mandalay is your stay!"

I have 2 major complaints, being that I have been to numerous other casino's in Vegas. The servers there are not very people friendly. They basically just walk around saying \"drinks\", and never approach any of the people playing the slots. Other casinos that I have visited, the servers actually come up next to you and ask you of you'd care for a drink. Here at the Mandalay bay you literally have to look for them, or hunt them down. Some even act as if it is an inconvenience to them to take your drink order, even though you are tipping them each time and spending several thousand in the casino. My biggest complaint is the sheer number of kids running all over the casino with no parental supervision. I \"thought\" that you have to be 21 to be on the actual casino floor. Atleast this is what I have always been told. If they are going to eat they need to walk around the perimiter of the casino floor. There is no reason for screaming toddlers to be on that casino floor, and security needs to do a better job of keeping their eyes out for this. I saw one toddler pitching a tantrum while his parents were sitting at a slot machine 15 feet away. Look if you want to gamble, find a sitter. Don't leave your kids off to the side, while you hit the slots. Another thing DO NOT even touch any of the food in your room that's on a weight censor. My husband just picked up the box with the \"adult stuff\" in it to see what the box said was inside, and we see a charge on our room bill when we go to check out. Just don't even touch the stuff. We didn't even order room service, because the prices are INSANE to say the least. $260 for a bottle of Jack Daniels? LOL That's ludacris. I am not really someone to drink, so that part didn't affect me. It's just the prices are ridiculously high. The hotel itsself is gorgeous. I love all of the chandaliers at the check in area. I also highly recommend the Burgar Bar. I LOVED that place. It's upstairs in the shopping mall area. I just ask that this hotel do a better job of keeping kids out of the casino. I mean think about it. There are a lot of very intoxicated people all throughout the casino, and plus it's very crowded. A kid could easily get lost in there. I would go back to the Mandalay bay, and I do hope that someone in management there reads this and addresses these issues."

Staying in a quality hotel such as Mandalay Bay should eliminate petty problems that you'd experience at lesser quality hotels. However, such is not the case during this stay at Mandalay Bay. I've not been able to take a shower or bath for the past three days. I've had to wash my hair in the sink and give myself a \"wash cloth\" bath each morning as there is NO cold water in the shower or bath. When turning on the water each morning, it goes from luke warm to hot in less than a minute and then scalding hot. Mandalay Bay is fortunate that this hasn't resulted in first degree burns! The first engineering call resulted in a nice note left on the bathroom vanity with a generic printed message telling me the problem had been resolved. Day two resulted in being unable to shower or bathe due to scalding water. The housekeeping supervisor placed a call to engineering to fix the the issue. A third call was made that same evening when there was no cold water AGAIN and they replaced a cartridge in the bath tub. What a gullible person I must be since I rell for that A fourth call was made to engineering on day three and it resulted in the engineering employee telling me that it's an issue somewhere between the 26th and 34th floors and they don't know where the problem is located. Since he stated that they are unable to access the guest rooms for those floors. They have to wait until others start having hte same problem tand then might drain the main line at 3am. So, in other words, it's okay for me to be inconvenienced but not other guests to resolve the problem. Had I wanted an experience such as this, I wouled have stayed at the Motel 6! I'm appalled that no one offered to move me to a room that has cold water nor is anyone interested in me being inconvenced. Since my stay at Mandalay Bay is business related and my company produces an annual tradeshow at Mandalay Bay, I will be sharing my experience with executive management and our Board of Directors."

Our room as excellent with huge picture windows and an amazing view of the strip. The maid service was great. Loved the big TV in the room and the smaller one in the bathroom, and the lights inside the huge wardrobes. I also loved being able to smoke in my room. On the subject of smoking, the casino floor is a lot less smoky than some of the other casinos. The car park is behind Mandalay itself and when driving in it looks as if you're driving into 'THE HOTEL' at Mandalay, rather than the resort, but it is the right car park. It's a long walk across the casino floor to reception, but couldn't bring ourself to pay for valet parking. We had a great time playing on the electronic schemes at the bar, receiving comp drinks every time we put $20 in. As our round of Budweiser and vodka and coke cost $17, it was worth it, especially as we kept on winning the $20 back again. We had a fabulous meal in the Fleur de Lys restaurant and in the Italian restaurant, although its name escapes me. Wine was gorgeous in both. Also loved the atmosphere in the House of Blues. Had breakfast every morning of frozen yoghurt from the yoghurt/pancake place while my partner had something from Starbucks next door. The Shark's Reef exhibit was ok, but a little pricey. Lion King show was great value at $60 a ticket. The only problem with the hotel is that it's so far away at the far end of the strip. There's a free monorail to Luxor and Excalibur, but to change to the paid monorail from MGM to travel further is a lot of hassle. The walk from Excalibur to find the monorail behind MGM seemed to take forever. The bus was much more convenient as it could be caught right outside Mandalay and it travels all the way along the strip to the Stratosphere at the other end. I think it cost about $7 a day. The 'beach' area at Mandalay looked great, but was very overcrowded in September, so we didn't even bother. We heard that some people had spent over half an hour looking for sun beds. We weren't in Vegas to go to the beach so it didn't matter. We loved our stay at Mandalay and would love to visit Vegas again, but must admit that we may be tempted to stay somewhere more central."

The only complaint was, when we got there they had us in a room with 2 doubles so we asked for a king which they were able to provide. We went to the room and it was dirty. My wife and I went down and asked for another room and they insisted the only thing they had was a room with 2 doubles.. Right.. My wife had to mention we were on trip advisor in order for them to \"free\" up a room with a king. I'm sorry after making a couple slug all the way back down because a room was dirty should mean a quick hassle free yes what ever you need sort of response, instead we had to threaten. After that the stay was very pleasent.."

    "content": "We were very pleased with Mandalay Bay. It was clean, quiet, comfortable and everything we could ask for in a hotel on the strip. I like the fact that there is not a cheesy theme, just elegant decor and plenty of spacious hallways, walkways, etc. All of the stores, bars and restaurants that we visited on the grounds were clean, efficient, tasty and had good service. We were disappointed that the big pool was closed due to the season, but it's understandable and there was a small pool and large hot tub available. My two biggest complaints were that the lighting in the room seemed insufficient (especially the bathroom was dim) and we had to wait an excruciatingly long time to get our car from the valet once or twice. Highlights: * the gentleman who checked us in was great and we had an excellent room with a great view, pretty much looking straight up the strip * housekeeping was great, room was very clean * bed and pillows were great * room at end of hall was quiet and there were no smells or other unpleasantries to speak of * hotel felt roomy and we enjoyed the restaurants, shops and grounds * being at the end of the strip felt a little more secluded and was a nice place to retreat to * we had a great rate that included a $25 resort credit and discount at the spa * Burger Bar! Lowlights: * I wish there were more non-smoking common areas * being at the end of the strip made cab rides expensive but may be cancelled out by the highlight above about location * a few times we needed something from the front desk and we had to wait in some long lines - wish they had more staff or a more accessible concierge situation so we could get things we needed without waiting forever along with people trying to check in or out PS - a lot of people seem to complain about the window into the bathroom from the bedroom. First, I'd like to say that the toilet is in a separate closet, so no worries about people staying with you seeing you on the toilet. Also the glass is frosted in stripes, so for someone to see in to the tub or sinks, they would have to make an effort to look in. Lastly, the shower is off to the side (at least in our room) and I don't think it would have been possible to see in there due to the angle. The window is actually in the hall of the room and usually people do not just hang out in the hall of the bedroom, so concerns that the person you are staying with for a weekend in Vegas is going to see you in the bathroom seem a bit overblown. The person would have to make an effort and intend for this to happen. I found the overall decor, etc., to be much classier than other hotels. Loved the roominess of everything - some of the other casinos/properties make me feel claustrophobic. Was a very classy place. Excellent for the wedding we attended, which was at the Little Chapel of the West just a block or so away."

The big complaint I had was on the bathroom. There were two issues. First, there is a window in the bathroom..which is odd. You can't shut off light coming out of the bathroom. The other issue was that when you shut off the main light in the bathroom, this lighting under the vanity came on. I guess this is some kind of night light, but you can't shut it off. When you add it to the window in the room, you can't get the room dark. That is pretty lame for a hotel room."

We were booked for four days of the week before Christmas and the hotel was busy. There were many families with small children..but Mandalay Bay is spacious with room for all of us. Our room on the twentieth floor was super. Comfortable bed, wonderful large bathroom with two sinks, glass enclosed shower, separate WC , and a wall mounted tv...great for checking on t he near monsoon weather. Amenities were geared for couples get aways and a variety of packages were available for purchase.... not our deal but fun for some. We have stayed here before several years back. Several changes have improved the hotel. The room is more subdued in decor, the tv is plasma, the tub works, and the housekeeping top notch and on time ! The in room safe does not hold a 15\" laptop, but was enough for our valuables...a Kindle would fit. We like the location, and despite steady downpours for nearly three days we encountered no problems. In Particular we like being able to drive out of self-park and head to Red Rock, Lake las Vegas, or Summerlin with virtually no strip traffic headaches. Incidentally, the new City Centre is a must see...but get your coffee at Mandalay Bay at either of two Starbucks and pay far less...That goes for almost everything! But the place is enormous, glossy, shiny, and oddly decorated with no discernable theme...BUT..it has a great statue of Elvis!!! And a fun fountain that kids just loved. At Mandalay, the buffet was excellent, the staff helpful and gracious, the Cardio Room well appointed and supervised, and the parking easy by Vegas standards...and we will definitely be back ! ."

    "content": "I stayed at the Mandalay Bay 5 years or so ago before they renovated. The renovations are fantastic and give the rooms a fresh, modern appearance. Bathrooms are nice and big and the bath products (M Pulse) were nice and worthy of slipping in my bag before I left. There is one thing about the renovated rooms that I can't understand...they put a WINDOW in the bathroom that you can see as you walk in the door and down the hall. I stayed in a king size room so I assume most people that are doing this don't mind seeing their loved one hopping out of the shower, but if this type of set up is in the queen size bedrooms, I can imagine MANY awkward moments. You can't turn off the view or hide despite some frosting stripes on the glass...you literally see into the bathroom and it freaked me out when some friends came over. I HATED this feature of the hotel room. Who thought of this??? The rest of the room was clean and comfortable with comfy beds and a sitting area. The resort fee the hotel charges includes internet and gym access. I can't complain about the price at all since the hotel practically paid me to stay there with some pre-Christmas deals. I had a hard time at check in getting a resort credit put on my account...it was very annoying. If you book a room here with the expectation of a resort credit, be sure to mention it at check-in or you may not get it. None of the restaurants impress me at MB so I ended up at the Four Seasons Verandah next door despite the resort credit. Ate one mediocre meal at the Red, White, and Blue Cafe. Fine for most people I guess. Mix Lounge is a great trip and provides the best views in Vegas. They did away with their happy hour but it's only a matter of time before they close it and re-configure as it's gotten \"stale\" by Vegas standards. Overall, a nice trip to MB and no real complaints other than a slow check in due to resort credit problems. Otherwise, Mandalay Bay, specifically THE Hotel, is one of the best resorts on the strip...much quieter and more relaxed than the chaos at Caesar's and other mid-strip casinos. Oh, and the pool...while not open in winter it truly is the best pool in Vegas!"

The bartenders at EyeCandy were very rude to me...last year I found them to be so friendly. I guess management has changed here? They don't pay much attention to you and so I refused to spend money where the bartenders prefer to socialize with each other over providing customer service...I had a great time at the MIrage and MGM and will stay elsewhere on the strip next time. Also, Mandalay charges a $55 resort fee for amenities that are mostly closed. They also didn't check my hotel keys before giving them to me so I had to go all the way back down to checkin after finding out the keys were duds and the girl offerred no apology. Just very lackluster hotel/casino. I won't stay again."

The second hand smoke was a major turn-off, but this was likely not going to change anytime soon. The kids enjoyed the strip, yet we all concluded that Las Vegas would be no place to live for us. Too much emphasis on money, sex and prostitution for our tastes. It is what it is."

There were a few little problems but nothing too serious. One of the sinks in the bathroom had a faulty plug and you could not keep water in there.

We had very high expectations after browsing the hotels website and paying a hefty price tag. However, the condition of the room and communication with the staff was inadequate, at best. We were severely disappointed with what the Mandalay Bay Hotel had to offer; pure unadulterated filth (see attached pictures). We noticed evidence of a poorly maintained hotel immediately. For starters, the carpet in the hallway (14th floor) and our room was extremely dirty (14-306). The carpet in our room was so bad that we were unable to walk on it with our bare feet. The bathroom shower had dark green and black mold in plain sight. Yet the worst, most disgusting discovers were found in my bed. There was clear evidence that the sheets had been slept on. There were numerous visible stains including what appeared to personal bodily fluids. Additionally, hair was all over the place. I can only imagine what type of diseases and/or skin infections that I could have caught had I slept on those rancid sheets. I immediately called the front desk to complain about the problem. I spoke with \u201cAnthony\u201d who seemed to be very unconcerned and nonchalant about my soiled bed. This led me to believe that he was accustomed to getting this type of complaint and was in turn just going through the motions. I seemed to take forever for housekeeping to arrive. In sum, our overall experience at the Mandalay Bay Hotel was severely tainted by the astoundingly low standards and deficient customer service."

Situated at the southern end of the strip it is quite a hike to the busier areas around Ceasers Palace or the Venetian but the hotel and casino are that well provided for with restraunts, nightclubs, bars, shops, etc then you can quite happily live here for days with needing to venture too far. The outdoor pool area looks fantastic but as I was here in December the temperature wasn't quite warm enough to take a dip. You need to pay for internet access in the rooms however I received it as a free upgrade, worked really well and high speed, just a pity it isn't always free!"

Yes, the location is extreme South on the strip, but it really didnt affect our experience....due to trams....moving walkways, and taxis, we were able to get where we wanted with very little effort. The property itself: casino, restaurants, bars were fine. I really had no compliants. Well maybe one.....the bartenders at the Sports Book were not at pleasant and attentive as they could be....especially when you put in a $100 bill into Keno machine and play out. Burger Bar is FAB....I recommend it for sure. Red White and Blue Cafe offers a reasonablly priced delicious breakfast with $5 Mimosas ad Bloody Marys all day. Our favorite place to hang out and gamble while in Vegas is Planet Hollywood......the great music, great bartenders, decent restaurant offering, in addition to the mall on-site, all contribute to this. Mandalay doesnt offer the same environment and fun factor, in my opinion. Note: the rooms at PH don't impress me either. My main complaint about this property is the \"tired\" looking rooms and hallways. The carpets in the hallway, from the moment you step out of the elevator, all the way down the halls, into the room are pretty nasty and smoky (even though its supposed to be nonsmoking in the halls). Upon entering the room, I was disappointed.....old looking furniture, beat up wooden night stands, worn looking closet doors. Just the whole feel provided no \"wow\" factor. I am soooo glad that I didnt pay alot for the room......I would have been deeply disappointed. Front desk folks, players club personnel, and restaurant servers were all very pleasant. Enjoy Vegas.....ultimately, its really not where you stay....its Vegas!"

The bed was roomy enough for 4 if your into that. There is a weighted mini bar so don't move any items unless you want to be charged. The tv had plenty of hd channels. It also had a player sofa, very cool. The only single downside to the room is due to the position it only has one very small window, the curtain covers what looks like a large window but its a wall behind it. Great of them to upgrade us as were spending a lot of money with them over the next year so they have def set themselves up on the right foot. 2 happy customers so far. We ate at the buffet, good breakfast, Room service, even better. Stripsteak was good too but not amazing. Overall a great stay at a great hotel. We also got 75 bucks off our charges too due to our play. One point to be made is that the resort fee of $15 is going up soon, to what though, I do not know."

    "content": "I've been traveling to Las Vegas quite regularly for the last 10 years, and have stayed at about half of the Strip properties, tending to gravitate towards the mid-level hotels. Once again, M-Bay supplied a very solid hotel stay to me for a very decent price ($70/night, with $100 resort credit). Yes, the place is starting to show it's age, but most places in LV from this era are. If they were charging as much as the Bellagio, the Wynn, the Venetian, I would expect a full remodel of the rooms. But that's not the case.. they are usually 33%-50% cheaper than these other properties. Therefore I do not try to compare them. I found the common areas of the hotel, casino, and shopping areas to be well-kept and clean, as they always have been. During the day, there are still quite a few options for dining, although as some have pointed out, many tend to be a bit over-priced. But from my experience, the quality is usually there to at least have an enjoyable meal. I was disappointed with the late-night options, as once the clock hits 11pm, it seemed all restaurants except the Cafe were closed. Then again, why am I eating after 11pm?? Probably a bad idea anyways.. My room this time was on the 16th floor, serviced by the 1-16 elevator bank. Never waited longer than 10 seconds for a lift, which was awesome as this has been an issue on prior visits. The room was one of their standard rooms, 550sq ft I believe. Plenty of space for even 4 people if you're traveling like that. The wooden furniture was definitely showing wear-and-tear, but it's still functional. The bed was plenty comfortable, and clear of ANY signs of bedbugs (yes, I'm a bit paranoid now..we all should be..look at NYC!). The sheets probably should be replaced though..worn and stained/burnt/etc. The bathrooms are solid, with both the soaking tub and seperate shower still being in decent shape. The double sink setup is plenty big enough for numerous items to be spread out on the countertop, I am of the opinion that the toilet seperated from the rest of the bathroom is a GOOD thing, and this is standard in the M-Bay bathrooms. I appreciated that the wireless internet was included in the resort fee.. it's actually one of the justifications that I'll \"buy\", even though I still think the practice of charging the resort fees is bogus. The wireless service was decent, but I'm not sure how trust-worthy. I would not do any online banking, but it's great for checking showtimes, weather, addresses, etc. They might as well throw the old phone books OUT. All in all, this was another solid stay at the Bay.."

The dreaded check-in was a breeze. Corey at the front desk was more than happy to give us a strip-view room and answered all of our questions knowledgeably. The view was to die for. Our trip was the first week in November and coming from a cold climate, Vegas was the perfect temperature. We even went in the wave pool and lazy river(we were the only ones besides some little kids. The breakfast buffet at Raffles was delicious and a good value. The only issue was that Mandalay is the far south end of the strip and we wanted to explore every day, so my feet were killing me by day three. If you are just looking to relax, you would never need to leave this paradise as everything is right here. The spa was a fantastic oasis from the excitement. One more word of advice for travelers to Sin City, don't miss the Neon tour or Nathan Burton, both great values."

We did opt to up-grade to a suite from a regular room. I probably wouldn't do that again. The room was very nice, large, but we really didn't need the extra space. The room was clean, although showing a little wear around the edges of the carpet. The rooms are darker than usual--I think due to the gold sheeting on the outside of the windows. Wireless interneti was included in the daily room charge and it worked well. However, my i-phone did not work so well in the room. ? The beach at the hotel was closed for the season, so we did not get to experience that, but it looked like a lovely setting. I would most certainly stay in this hotel again."

This hotel used to be known for its strict cleaning policies and was spotless. I guess not anymore. My room was fine but didn't have many of the things rooms here used to have: no robe, no extra pillow, very stripped-down bathroom amenities, etc. Front desk staff was helpful and checked me in way ahead of check-in time with no hassle. I know it's a slow time of year, and the city as a whole is in a huge downturn, but it is sad to see Rum Jungle completely shuttered and maybe 2 or 3 people in Red Square and Lupo.

After reading about how crowded it is, we went out around 9:30 am and had our pick of spots. We grabbed 4 loungers pretty much in front of the wave pool. As the day went on, more loungers were added and you couldn't even walk between the chairs..literally just a few inches apart. Really crammed in like sardines. Just t the left of us was a section with super cushy comfy loungers a good foot apart...for sale for about $100 each I think for the day--too rich for our blood (that would be $400 for the 4 of us!). The wave pool is really a blast though...so definitely worth one visit. We got a good deal on our room and it was fine with a nice view of the pool. We were told about the $15 resort fee at the time we booked and so aren't going to whine and complain about it here like others have. It's just another source of revenue for hotels...almost all hotels charge one---book somewhere without one if it bothers you so much. I enjoyed the casino. Wasn't too crowded...and had a beautiful bar with video poker and keno machines---so you can order a free cocktail and play video keno for a quarter. I would definitely recommend everyone stay here once just for the pool."

We also found the room to be very noisey, the aircraft would start to fly @ 5.00am and coming from the UK we were jet lagged and could not get back to sleep !! We also found getting a drink imossible and never had one entire time we were there !! although this is typical for the Bay . It is also a long walk from anywhere, we decided to stay here because of the time of year as we would not be sun bathing so were happy to walk in the temperatures ( not so any other time of the year ) we would never stay here normally but i guess its satisfied my curiosity now. The next 3 nights were spent at the Mirage, massive improvement in all areas !! I have given it 4 stars as its a nice hotel with a great pool, and for many this hotel will be great, just no us !"

I slipped and fell in a puddle of oil at their taxi stand, and since I was fine and not litigious, I asked them to kindly clean my clothes that were damaged, and what wasn't fixed they credit my room that amount. They needed to comp me for my pants, but they tried to charge me for the dry cleaning. After a call to the front desk manager on duty, it was squared away. I feel they should have been a bit more concerned than they were, but they really didn't care, and I didn't make a stink out of it since I was fine. We had a night missing from our bill, so I think they comped us a night and just never told us? I consider it a wash. We had a 600SS room and a Media Suite during our stay. The Media Suite was the nicest room I could find on their website, and for a pretty penny, we had our after wedding party here, and had a blast. We comfortably fit 28 people in the room for the after party. Spa was really nice, yet, not the nicest I have seen. Fleur De Lys and Burger Bar were golden, I am Hubert Keller's biggest fan!

No big deal though. Beautiful view from the 29th floor. Staff was very nice and accomodating. The conference rooms were comfortable and the food at the meetings was good. Casino didn't seem busy. I didn't see anyone at the high roller tables. No drinks seemed to be offered to small time gamblers at the slots. I haven't been to Vegas for over ten years but it seems times have changed. I don't gamble so I mention this as a point of interest. Food also has gotten more expensive. Figure in 20 bucks a head no matter which restaurant you chose. Food was good at Noodles. This isn't a big deal either, because there are other dining establishments nearby within walking distance. The resort is at the end of the strip but we enjoyed walking as far as The Bellagio. It's fun to see the street scene anyway. If you get tired, the public transportation system is excellent. You can ride 24 hours for 7 dollars. The resort did tack on a resort fee at checkout. I'm not sure what we received for this. No free internet. The glory years in Vegas may have gone by. Overall, it's become pretty pricey...wonder if they are pricing out a lot of middle class travelers? At the end of the day, I would stay here again."

On our last visit to LV, we stayed at the Venetian, and I thought that staying on the opposite end of the strip might not be as fun. But we barely needed or wanted to leave the property! We walked to Luxor and Excalibur (skip the latter) and it's also connected to the tram, which we did not get to use. The property is awesome. The beach was closed but it looked amazing, and if we bring the kids with us next time they'll love it, and all the other pools. The room seemed small for a suite. We loved the modern decor, a sweet square couch for two, and iPod dock. The bed itself was comfy, but the pillows were quite soft. It doesn't bother me, but my husband had a hard time sleeping because of it. Also, the sheets were comfortable but shabby. A few were even ripped. And I cannot understand why they use flat sheets on the mattress. It never stays; every morning I'd wake up with my face on the bare mattress...yuck! The blanket was one of those plasticky 80s style hotel blankets that feels like it's made out of styrofoam fabric. And the comforter, while stylish, lacked comfort. The bathroom was spacious and clean, with plenty of storage, and a wonderful jacuzzi bathtub. The casino was great and the staff was amazing. We had a great time at RM Seafood, which took fish to a whole new level of deliciousness! The buffet was decent, totally worth the day pass. We ate at the House of Blues during the gospel brunch...big mistake, the service was horrible. Good food, though. We were disappointed in the lunch specials at the Noodle Bowl; that was pretty much the only disappointing meal. Outside the MB, we visited Hash House a Go-Go, which was the best and biggest breakfast I've ever had! We visited Gold and Silver Pawn of \"Pawn Stars\" fame, which was fun; we got to see all the guys and purchased a few keepsakes :). We also saw \"La Reve\", which was amazing. In essence, Mandalay Bay is a great stay, and especially worth it to go when the weather is hot and the beach is open. They definitely need to upgrade the bedding and put more emphasis on the comfort rather than the modern. You can definitely do posh AND cozy, nowadays! However, the service cant be beat! We'll definitely be back, hopefully sooner rather than later!"

The room was a little more plain than I thought it would be, but still nice. We just had the base room. The bed was very comfortable and the shower and bathroom were nice. We happened to be there when the Latin Grammy's were being held there. I felt sorry for the security people. They had quite a crowd to handle that was hoping to get a peek at a \"star\". They did a very good job. The only drawback from the hotel was the mini-bar tray under the TV. Apparently it is weight activated and if you even move an item you get charged. I had to straighten out my bill when I checked out, but they were very good about it."

If you have been here before, be warned that the resort fee ($15) no longer includes access to the (wonderful) full gym, but instead is just a room with cardio equipment crammed in, 5 machines not working and water for sale. for and extra $15 you can access the proper gym, and another $10 on top of that the spa rooms. If you don't mind the extra charges, the experience is nice. The last time I stayed here I arrived to find a room with rotten half eated fruit on the dresser and a used robe on the floor. This time they didn't clean my room one day (out of my room from 9:00am to 6:00pm, with a 10 minute return at 2:00pm.) I complained both times and managment was accomodating, but at their advertised rates and ratings, why should I have to complain?"

    "content": "We stayed at the Mandalay Bay for 5 nights, it was awesome. We had a deluxe room and it was great very clean as well, we had a king sized bed in our room, 2 cupboards to hang clothes in, massive flat screen TV, a big set of draws for our clothes to fold. Every day house keeping came in and gave us fresh new towels, made the bed and cleaned the room so it was like how it was when we first arrived !! There is wi-fi as well with great signal but you have to pay an extra fee per day to get the wi-fi for free. The resort pools are brilliant as well, there is a pool which is just like a beach and has real waves and a few other pools as well its really like a tropical resort with heaps of palm trees and sun beds !! They also have a day spa which is $25 for a day pass and you can go in and out as many times as you want in that day, there is a sauna, 3 spas all different temps and a steam room its very relaxing !! The casino isn't the best or biggest one in Vegas but its still great and probably one of the cleanest out of all of the ones I went to in Vegas. The restaurants there was great as well but VERY expensive and Starbucks there is very expensive as well I bought 1 coffee, 1 cup of fruit and 1 cup of yogurt and it cost me $18 something - WHOA !!! The buffet is a MUST it has the best desserts and well worth the price !! There is a fitness centre as well but you cannot used the weights they are extra charge to go into the weights room. Also the rooms are very dark when the curtains are closed and very qiuet so great to have a sleep in if needed. There also is a free tram from the Mandalay Bay to the main part of the strip so its very easy to get back to the hotel at night and you dont have to get a taxi unless you are way far down the strip !! I would choose to stay here rather than The Hotel. I highly recommend the Mandalay Bay !!"

Even though the hotel is huge we never had any problems with noise. The rooms are very clean and offer brilliant views up the strip if you're lucky enough to be that side. The only down side is that the casino minimum stakes are quite high, so I suggest trying some other casinos if you don't want to spend too much at the tables!"

We loved Mix restaurant, it was pretty cheap, we didn't have to wait and the food was great! This hotel may be a little more expensive than others, but well worth it!"

But the room was comfortable and the service was good, and even though you do have to walk through the casino to get anywhere, their ventilation system seemed to be better than most -- I didn't feel like I'd bathed in an ashtray by the time I got to my destination. I was there for a business conference, and I was glad I was able to book a room at Mandalay Bay rather than having to stay at another hotel -- it was a 10-minute walk from my room to the convention center, so I would have had to allow a good bit more travel time to get there from another location. One nice feature was that I was given 2 drink coupons upon check-in -- I enjoyed being able to sit & relax with a drink after a day of meetings. It IS Vegas, though -- so if you don't want to be awakened at all hours of the night by loud partiers in the hallways, bring earplugs! Also note that while they don't charge separately for internet, there's a mandatory daily \"resort fee\" that includes use of the exercise room and in-room internet."

    "content": "Went with my spouse for a conference with another chain of hotels (over 8,000) in attendance. Hotel was beautiful in the lobby, casino was sparse compared to others. But I was there for work so that wasn't a major factor, as work graciously supplied the hotel for us. Our room was not on the same side of the hotel as the rest of my company. No biggie but a long walk for the conference. However, working for a mid-scale hotel chain, I notice things quickly as far as cleanliness and quality standards. 1. Sheets on the bed were ill-fitting and keep sliding up when we slept. 2. Items on the pressure-sensitive shelves were set very precariously so that even opening a drawer in the cabinet below jostled them out of the socket causing a charge (which I did not have to pay) 3. Had upgraded with my own money to a larger room, the suite with a jacuzzi tub and large square sofa that showed quite a view on the internet pictures. Well, the sofa sat in front of the window where the curtains would not open so it was worthless to use to see the sub-standard view of the parking lot. Here's the doozy: there was hair on the comforter and soap scum on the glass shower walls. That is a no-no in the hotel business so I was upset by this the most. I can deal with not having a coffee maker but I cannot deal with a room that is not clean. It was an overall decent hotel, especially since I didn't have to pay for much of the accommodations. But, when you are housing a hotel conference, the cleanliness is very important. On the bright side, the convention center is lovely, the pool areas are great, and the service staff cannot be beat. The bar, wait, and lobby staff were all remarkable persons who more than made up for any shortcomings. I know most people do not go to Vegas for the hotel, but working in the field, I can appreciate the smiling, pleasant faces I encountered every day."

Unfortunately, the bed had already been made but when I mentioned this to the housekeeper, remade the bed with the proper bottom sheet and from then on it was no longer an issue.

    "content": "Last time I was in Vegas, I saw Grateful Dead at UNLV Stadium in the 1990's when it was 113 degrees F during the concert and the Luxor was almost finished internally. The Mandalay was awesome! Staff was friendly, grounds are probably best in Vegas. It does have an \"air\" of Playboy at the Palms to it. Clearly the hostess filter whom they proposition to come join their \"exclusive\" beach club. My significant other was approached every time leaving the hotel going to the \"beach\". I would say it is worth it on a crowded weekend. The beach is overcrowded and you cannot find a beach chair. Hard to believe but true nonetheless. The facts. Would I go back? YES! At this point, Mandalay is the only place I'll go back to....what I can say...their Casino was friendly to me. Even if I didn\u2019t win money. We plan on making this an annual trip now! My second time and my sig other\u2019s first time. We\u2019re hooked. The standard room is very comfortable. Jacuzzi tub, etc. Fridge, but no room for you to put anything in there. Electronic lock safe. My main criticism of the room...it's vegas. People gamble late, party late, etc. We had a room 16 floor, that was across from the maid station arming themselves for the daily routine. Bad, bad, bad location. While I was recovering from a night of fun, they were essentially yelling for an hour doing what they do to prepare to service the rooms. Ok maybe not yelling, but I woke up to them at 7:am and never went back to sleep. The maid stations are about 2/3 way down the wings so BEAWARE for rooms in the equivalent of #16-325 range (not sure what the room numbers for the other two wins would be). The shower did not drain well from the get go. After day 2, we left a note please fix the shower. It was fixed the same day. Kudos. I was not expecting it, but it was a nice pleasure. HINT: the shear fact that I was not expecting it to be fixed so fast should be a clue to an intangible aspect of not 5 star. Mandalay, contact me personally if you want more details. The Casino is great. Things are a little expensive...food wise if you don't do the all day buffet. We never did it so I can\u2019t say if it was good or bad. All restaurants patronized, were great. Worth the money, except for the Mix. We tried, but it was rented out. For that matter, about a fifth of the beach was rented out. Sounds small, but when the beach is oversold, that is a big deal. No sunset cocktails because the Mix was otherwise unavailable. I don't fault anyone trying to make a buck, but that is a little over the top. The only place with a view and we had t o admire it through wall of people...mostly smoking I might add. The rooms have pretty much anything you might want. Soft pillows, big LCD flat screen, big bathroom. A real hair dryer, awesome soap and shampoo. Friendly service all around--minus the loud maids in the hallway. We saw the Frank Caliendo show at Monticino...SO NOT WORTH IT. Likely it will be gone by the time you read this...or it should be gone. We saw his DVD video...hilarious. The live show was like watching a repeat. RIP OFF! (BTW, no relation to the Mandalay). Mandalay is at the south end of the strip. If you plan on staying out late on the strip, the monorail stops service at 10:30 pm, so you\u2019ll want to taxi back after that point. You could walk, but you\u2019ll be walking for a considerable distance bordering a parking lot. Safe? Don\u2019t know but I would not my female friend doing it alone. Coffee: another gripe, Starbucks does NOT give free drip coffee refills. In fact, the casino charges a surcharge of $1 on everything on the establishment. There were a few restaurants we patron but that is for another post. Contact me if you want our opine on food places. Mandalay nightlife\u2026again hostess selectively chooses whom she approaches to give a free pass too. I don\u2019t fault any of them for being critical of whom they give free passes too. Nature of the beast. Back in the 1990\u2019s, Vegas was cheap or free. Gone are those days. The new motto\u2026.\u201dyou pay for everything.\u201d Again, I don\u2019t fault them, but don\u2019t expect things to be cheap. On the contrary, as expensive as NY\u2014little sticker shock there. If Mandalay wants to be a 5-star, step up it\u2019s game and anticipate guest\u2019s needs. It still amazes me that given the known restrictions on tubes of toothpaste, mouthwash, etc. that quality hotels do not provide all necessities that otherwise are confiscated at the portal. Q-tips\u2026no one ever supplies q-tips. Why? So cheap yet a nice pleasantry. They have a beach, why not an afternoon supply of sunscreen. The list goes on. It may cost them $50 for all things considered. But the intangible bonus is way more (or at least could be if they provided those amenities)"

Instead, go to either the beach club (although you have to pay) or the more secluded pool area off to the side, where you can sit and sip your drink in the pool. In general, I would say that MB is family-friendly, which to some people is great, to others a real turn-off. The location at the end of the strip isn't ideal, but cab rides to other casinos were relatively inexpensive and always easy to find. One tip: Avoid Raffles- the food is overpriced and not that great."

The rooms were very nice with the exception of the carpet which looked like it had never been cleaned. There were several high class restaurants in the hotel however we opted for the lower cost options two doors down at Excalibur. There is a shuttle that runs from Mandalay to Luxor to Excalibur which was great when it was operational however hours were somewhat limited. The casino area was very nice and the lobby very extravagant. We did receive a discounted rate for our room. So for what we paid the hotel was fine however I would not pay full price as the hotel is far away from all the action. This would be a great place to stay during warmer months when the beach area is open. Keep in mind it is closed during the cooler months and only a side outdoor pool is open."

    "content": "I stayed at the hotel from October 9-16. It was my first time in Las Vegas. Randy at the front desk was quite helpful. I read some of the other recent reviews and there is a grain of truth, both positive and negative, on all reviews. Not enough elevators. The interior of the rooms and the hallways were an olive drab (this from a guy that has gone on many golf trips and stayed in far less expensive hotels). The walls to the rooms are surprisingly thin. The space to the rooms, the t.v and the bathrooms were wonderful. The concierge's were not good. First of all, not enough of them. I was the second person in line and I had to wait 20 minutes just to get the Las Vegas events book. One concierge that we had must have worked for the C.I.A. at one time because it was like pulling teeth to get information out of her. On another occasion, the concierge did not know that there was a cigar shop in the building as I was seeking directions. The lazy river is excellent. As for the location, we took the tram to get from hotel to hotel, taking it up to the Sahara so that we could then walk to the Stratsphere. While some of the restaurants in the hotel were too expensive, you could find some restaurants to fit our budget. My one complaint about Las Vegas is the smoke in the casinos, it has to go since people have been trained to light up outside. The best thing about the hotel were the other guests, they were quite friendly. Final verdict, an overpriced three star hotel. I'm sorry if I had any typing or spelling errors."

    "content": "This hotel was deeply disappointing. The location, while close to the airport, is a long way from where we spent most of our time. That meant a taxi ride to go anywhere. That was our first disappointment and then the disappointments just kept coming. The room appeared nice upon arrival but as soon as you invetsigate a little, you found annoying things. First, they provide a coffee maker but if you want a cup of coffee, they charge you $6 for it. Plus the coffee maker didn't work. The kleenex container did not have a kleenex box in it. I left it for a day thinking housekeeping would replcae it but they didn't. That meant a call to housekeeping. Not a big deal but disappointing. At night was the worst. The walls don't seem to be sound proof so we had to put up with our next door neighbour throwing up all night. Not very pleasant and disconcerting about how \"unprivate\" your room was. When we arrived, they provided us with some free drink tickets but when you went to the 3 bars where the drinks were to be free, they seemed to be closed all the time. In addition, they provided us with a sheet at check-in that outlined some privileges. One of the privileges was that we were able to get a free USA Today paper every day but you had to go downstairs to get it. What other hotel on the planet brags about giving you a free newspapaper and then makes you go downstairs to get it. The disappointing thing was that other people on the floor would get a newspaper at their door. So somebody was already there delivering newspapers on the floor but they would go right past my door. I suggest they either give you a free newspapaer at your door or don't at all. If you want any peace and quiet, this is not the place to go. Not only is it a convention hotel, so you get big crowds but it also has a beautiful beach and wave pool. Unfortunately, the wave pool and beach attarct a ,lot of families so the building has many more children than other hotesls on the strip. One of the biggest disappointments with this hotel was the elevators. There just aren't enough of them. The number of times we waited for an elevator and then let it go by because it was too full was far too often. Most people going down learned that you probably should get an elevator going up and then ride it down. While this hotel loooks great and has a great beach, everything else is low class. If you want a great hotel in in Las vegas, go to Trump and avoid Mandalaly Bay. It will just disappoint you."

The shower only had scalding hot water coming out of it, the power flickered on a and off a couple of times while 2 of us were getting ready in the bathroom, we had to call 3 times to get towels and glasses brought up (we finally put our dirty towels and glasses out in the hallway and they were not picked up for about 8 hours), when housekeeping finally came the sheets on the beds were never changed even though that service was requested, the smoke detector had a plastic bag wrapped around it (seriously), the drinks at the clubs were VERY expensive and weak and the bartenders were rude, at the \"guests only\" beach you had to pay $22 to get a tube to float in....."

One of the whirlpools was broken. The beach-side casino (highly talked about in the promotional literature) was closed. The mini-bar in the room and \"sensors\" which detect if you touch or move anything. While there is a refrigerator in the room - there is no space to store your own beverages. Even thought we made a little space, someone entered the room and removed our items! A simple breakfast for two with coffee and tip ends up being $50. Very disappointed in the friendliness and willingness of staff to provide information. We will choose another hotel without resort fees next time!"

The hotel next door had cheaper places to eat for lunch (Quiznos, McDonalds, ect.) The only thing I didn't like about this hotel was that it was on the end of the strip. We still managed to walk down to the fashion show mall and back. The wave pool was nice but I wish there were more waitresses. Never one around when you needed a drink.

We found all the staff we had dealings with to be extremely helpful and polite. Our room rate included the buffet-and that was the one disappointment. A large variety of average food. We ended up going elsewhere for dinner on the second night of our stay. Mandalay Bay is at the very south end of the strip. There is a tram that takes you to the Excalibur, which shortens your walk to the center of the strip, by a few minutes. However, the tram operates to 10:30 pm only. My suggestion is that you stay at the Mandalay only if you have a car ( which we did), otherwise you are looking at a minimum walking time to the center of the Strip of about 1 hour. Also, I would suggest that you ask for a room facing the pool as opposed to the Strip-a Strip facing room means you will also be facing the airport."

Nothing can beat a beach like atmosphere in the middle of the desert. The inside of the hotel is gorgeous and the staff is very kind. Inside the casino, there are multiple restuarants and bars one can attend. Also, there are a handful of card tables and even more slots for those of you who like to indugle in a little gambling fun. Mandalay Bay has accomdated their guests needs by adding a costf ree tram that connects to two other hotels that are closer to the strip. The rooms are awesome and the bathrooms are huge! It was definitely a great decision to stay at Mandalay bay and i would recommend it to everyone!"

    "content": "We always catch a early flight from the Dallas/Ft. Worth airport, so we can have more time in Las Vegas. We had made arrangements earlier to check in to the hotel early. We like to check in change our clothes and go to the pool to start a much needed vacation. Most of you will probably be satisfied with checking in at the regular time and then going to your room so you can start getting acclimated to the strip and look for what to see and do. We checked in and were greeted with an enthusiastic welcome and excellent customer service. Their positive response set the tone of our stay and was consistent throughout our time in the hotel. Grounds keepers, maids or pool attendants were always friendly and very helpful. Our room was very luxurious and spacious with a large king size bed, big screen LCD TV and of course the usual snack bar. You will have to be careful around the snack bar, because they have sensors now so that when you lift an object you will be automatically billed for it. Be careful around the snack bar to prevent checkout problems for items you accidentally touched. The bathroom was large and tiled with marble with two sinks for ease of use with the proper number of outlets beside each sink for your appliances. The hair dryer is quality and pretty good sized. There is a small LCD TV mounted high on the wall next to the last sink for keeping up with sports, weather or the hotel channel for special events. The glass enclosed shower is large and of course has the pulsating head to make your showering experience relaxing. The tub has the jacuzzi heads to simulate taking a bath in a hot tub. The jets are pretty strong and after a long walk on the strip can be very relaxing. The Coffee dispenser is located on the shelf below the TV and quite modern with the little cartridges for individual cups of coffee. They offer the regular and of course De-cafe if you need it. It is usually well stocked, the maids take of that, with the necessary condiments for your coffee. The cream is in those little containers and they offer a variety to make it more pleasurable when you have that morning cup after a long night of gambling and riotous living. The hotel restaurants are reasonably priced except of course the ones with expensive unpronounceable names. You can find everything from the regular sirloin steak cooked to perfection to sushi The \"house of blues\" located in the hotel offers music along dinner to make your dining experience more fun. We are usually on a budget, like most of you, so we did the buffet and enjoyed a variety of good food. They have a deal now, most of the hotels offer the same thing, where you can pay one price and essentially eat breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel buffet. We just did the dinner buffet and found it to have a good mixture of seafood to prime rib. Once again the service people were very customer service oriented and gave us suggestions or answered our questions about the food. I've enclosed pictures from the pool area because that's where we spent most of our time. They have a wave pool with a sandy beach and plenty of seating. We chose one of the smaller more secluded pools with afternoon shade. The only problem we experienced, which for most of you is probably not annoying, was the blaring music from strategically located speakers on poles around the pool areas. We came to relax and found the mix of music broke the mood. Usually we went down to the pool early in the morning with our coffee and a good book. By about 3 in the afternoon it was time to go change and start walking on the strip to look at people. If you go to Vegas, most of the fun is walking around and looking at the other people walking around looking at you. Seems to be an global pastime. The hotel has a convenient walk way connecting you with the Luxor hotel next door. You can then use the connecting walk way between the Luxor and the Excalibur. When your returning from the strip, you can catch the tram from the Excalibur to the Mandalay Bay Resort to save your walking. The connecting walkway from the hotel to the Luxor has a number of specialty shops and a few restaurants if your hungry and just want to eat inside away from the heat. The hotel is also noted for it's large ocean aquarium that appeals to the whole family. You can see a variety of fish and of course sharks. It's fairly inexpensive and great entertainment for the whole family. I hope you have a chance to experience the Mandalay Bay resort and enjoy your stay in Las Vegas. Let me know if you liked my evaluation. Thanks for taking the time to read it."

The hotel itself has also cut back and changed, the pool area reminds me of Disney World's food court - although it is right next to the beach area so those traveling with children might like this.

While I have some hotels I like more than others, I have never had a situation come up which I considered bad enough to not return to that hotel, but the Mandalay Bay has lost me as a customer. I booked a strip view, king bed, non-smoking room for my anniversary. Upon checkin, which was fast, though the clerk had a robotic personality, we proceeded to our room. I should note that I am not very sensitive to ciagrette smoke, it doesnt bother me too bad at all, but the instant I opened the door, I was overwhelmed by the smell of cigarette smoke. It was absolutely overpowering and disgusting. So obviously I needed a room change. I called the front desk (I was very polite, I am not the type to call and yell at people), explained the situation, and was told by the customer service gentleman, \"Well, Sir, you are in a non smoking room. There should'nt be any cigarette smell.\" I told him I understood that, and that was the problem, the room stinks horribly and it shouldnt! He told me he could switch my room, but I would lose my strip view, I told him I would not downgrade my room just because their housekeeping staff did not resolve the issue of overwhelming smoke in a non smoking room. I also told him it was my anniversary and I wanted a nice room. I asked about an upgrade since standard rooms were not available, he stated that was out of the question. After going back and forth for a few minutes, and being told there were no more strip view rooms available, I asked to speak to a manager. I was put on hold for roughly 8 seconds, the same cust. service rep picked up the phone and said, \"Sir, I have moved you one floor up to the 24th floor, strip view, king bed room.\" I said, \"So one just became available huh?\", \".......yes......\". Funny how after asking for a manager, a non existant room magically appears. He said he automatically transferred my keys to the new room. We walked to the new room, one floor up, keys did not work. Called from the phone near the elevators, a female clerk answered, and explained to me the previous rep. assigned me the wrong room, and that I was actually on the 20th floor. We hike down there, and after a 45 minute ordeal, get in the room. My biggest issue is I was never even given a simple apology. The Mirage, a lesser hotel arguably, sends you free champagne to your room if you even mention you are newly weds or there for a special occasion. Mandalay Bay put a major damper on my anniversary and they cant even give a simple apology? I am not one of these idiots who thinks that by having to wait in the checkin line for 15 minutes in a Vegas hotel, that entitles them to a penthouse style $1000 per night room upgrade from their $79 standard room they booked since they had to wait a couple minutes. Get real. But hell, a major hotel makes me chase around for 45 minutes because of their mistakes and nothing? No apology even? Mandalay Bay is way to corporate run for me and souless to the customer. I'll be staying elsewhere next time."

Since we were saving for our honeymoon and had spent a considerable amount of our own money on the wedding prep and costs we only booked for a spa suite room. When we got there for check in and told the desk assistant that we were getting married. She offered to upgrade us to a suite for a small amount more. We figured, \"why not?\", since we were only staying one night and it was for our wedding. O.M.G. The suite was AMAZING!!!! We were on floor 31 and had the drapes opened to a window that ran the whole length of the suite with dramatic views south of the strip, not to mention the fantastic room. It was bigger than our two bedroom house with amenities to match its grandeur. The main bathroom alone was about the size of our living room with a jacuzzi tub, walk in shower, and a wide variety of lotions, soap and shampoo. They even brought us bathrobes (which were just to use while there) and slippers that we could take home. All in all it had a huge entryway, a small bathroom to the side of the door (when I say small I mean it was still bigger than our main bathroom at home) A living room, dining area, work table off to the side, very nice kitchen with a big television and other appliances, a sitting area/lounge room with 4 armchairs and an even bigger TV, master bedroom with ample closet space (and another large television) and enormous bathroom suited for any great 5 star hotel (also with another television in it). I invited my best friend/maid of honor up with her boyfriend because I felt it was too much to not share with anyone. We had champagne and then we kicked them out so we could get some rest for the next day. The bed was so comfortable. Everything was clean and immaculate. I couldn't find anything that I would suggest for improvement. Since Mandalay Bay also hosted our wedding and lunch at the Border Grill after, I'd have to say those all went perfect as well. If you want a wedding without the stress of the planning and are willing to select from the amenities they have to offer, I would certainly recommend Mandalay Bay. They practically have it down to a science and it's worth it for the money. My ONLY complaint was that the pool closes at 6pm (seems too early for a place that's got a great nightlife and is still 85 degrees at 10pm). We weren't able to enjoy the pool area as we started walking down at 5:45 as they were closing the gates."

    "content": "My family joined me for a trip to Las Vegas where I was attending a conference for Hoteliers. Check in was quick and efficient and the Lobby is far from the casino. This allowed us to check in without the usual background noise and smoky air that accompanies casinos. The lobby is beautiful. Valet is complimentary (though we made sure to tip) and our vehicle showed no signs of neglect. The room itself was perfect for us and the beds wonderful. However our bathroom was dirty. The sinks had hair and grime in them as did the toilet. They offered to send a housekeeper but we were showering when she got there so we didn't make her come back. We also requested a mini fridge- which they stated was complimentary but they never delivered it so a lot of our doggie bag food was wasted. The mini bar is hard for kids to avoid and we really had to keep on them to not touch the stuff on the dresser. I was annoyed they left it out where kids could see and grab it. The mini bar fridge is pressure sensitive so don't even TOUCH anything or they will charge you. The pool was great though they changed the hours without posting that on their website. The wave pool and lazy river are a lot of fun. There are a few things I didn't like customer service wise that as a GM I would never allow from my staff, but perhaps since they see Vegas as a world of its own it does not bother them. I also did not like how cabana rentals shot from $75.00 a day to over $500.00 just because it was Friday. Most still sat empty all day long. Didn't seem like a wise decision to me. Overall we enjoyed our stay but if I hadn't been required to stay there in order to have easy access to the conference we wouldn't have picked it. The price was reasonable however for a hotel of this quality. +'s Beds, room size, bathroom size, pools, restaurants. -'s Cleanliness (especially for a luxury hotel), staff attitude for SOME, price gauging on items and easy mini bar access for kids."

It was a great view and room very comfortable. Big huge comfy bed, 2 nice loungers and two TVs. Bathroom is huge with separate bath and shower. Room was always cleaned to a good standard and layout really good. Obviously everyone knows the hotel is at the end of the strip but that also has a plus side, the casino is not over crowded like all the others and of all casinos visited the Mandalay was the best. It was never smoky and smelt good. Use the free monorail to the Excalibur and walk from there. We used taxi's lots but with the strip being so big what ever hotel you stay at if you explore you always need to get a taxi back anyway. Hotel had free Wifi though this wasnt advertised at all. After ringing down they told me. Pool is good though hard to find shade. Try and get the lazy river side as shade was there in the afternoon. Lazy river is small and tube hire is a con but apart from that the hotel is great and would stay again without hesitation."

We stayed in the least expensive room but would have never known the difference! We had a very comfortable bed, couches and an amazing view. It is also nice that the windows are tinted so you can have pricay without having to close the curtains. The food and drinks are expensive but worth it. We ended up going to the Vons and picking up cereals and granola bars and some fruit to take to the beach swo we wouldn't have to buy breakfast everyday. The lifeguards are a bit unfriendly but the beach area is so amazing you will barely notice. I never had problems getting a beach chair between 9 and 1030, so it'sw not liek you have to wake up super early. There are a lot of kids, but the area is so large that it doesn;t seem to be much of an issue. Overall, great experience! We wuill be staying there again for sure next time we go to Vegas."

We got a nasty gram about putting a box of leftovers in the fridge and charged for items we did not use (they were missing when we got there). If you go- visit the site restaurant.com and get coupons to use in the hotel restaurants which saves quite a bit on a meal. The Red/White/Blue take out place was good as was Raffles breakfast. Didn't do the buffet. Dollar Car Rental is on-site and they were very friendly. If you want somewhere sort of in the middle of the strip then this is NOT the hotel for you as it is on the Southern End and the tram that runs to it only goes until 10:30 pm. Be sure to take your patience along from any hotel when taking rental car back to the airport as it should fall under the \"can't get there from here classification\"."

Rooms: clean and very nice- large bathroom, floor to ceiling windows, comfortable bed. The only downside is that the walls are pretty thin. We heard the guy in the room next to us yelling a couple of times, and we did hear some strip noise- sirens, motorcycles, etc. It didn't bother us, but if you have a party next door, it may be a problem. Carpet is worn- the hotel is showing its age, but overall it was very nice. Service: excellent- upon check-in, we asked for an upgrade, and the very friendly man at the front desk got us into a strip-view room, after apologizing that there were no suites available at THEhotel. It was THE BEST view I\u2019ve ever had in Vegas. Every employee that we passed in the halls greeted us and were very friendly. Also excellent service in the restaurants. Spa: my husband and I both booked a massage, and it was excellent. The spa was busy, but not overly crowded. Very clean and relaxing. Pool: I can see how this would be fun with kids. As adults we had a great time, went around the lazy river a couple of times and enjoyed the wave pool. Since it was late in the season (October) it was not super busy so it was enjoyable. Drinks were expensive and weak, as is the case with most pools, but service was very good- again, because it was not busy. Restaurants: We ate at Border Grill (snack/lunch), Raffles (breakfast), House of Blues (breakfast), RM Seafood (dinner), and Mix (dinner). We had restaurant.com certificates for most of those, and never had any problem using them. The servers usually made a point of telling us that a gratuity was already added, too, which was nice. Food was excellent everywhere- we especially love Mix. This was my second time there and I will be back! Mix is also my favorite lounge- awesome view, and between 5-10 pm, specialty drinks are half-price! Service in the lounge is especially friendly- I\u2019ve always felt very comfortable there. The only downfall that Mandalay Bay has is its location- the tram that connects to Excalibur is very handy, but one day it wasn\u2019t working, and the walk through Luxor and Excalibur is long and a little depressing. Otherwise, our stay there was great. I would certainly return."

My husband (6'5\" 250#) and I spent 4 nights in separate beds (what a romantic get away) and we were told too bad for us. Some days we had no room cleaning service. If you want coffee in the morning you can get room service for $12 a small pot that may take 30-60min to get to you, or you can walk to Star Bucks in the hotel which is a 10 min.walk. Everything in the hotel costs extra. You want to spend time at the pool, shade costs extra $50 and up, tubes to enjoy the relaxing flowing river! extra $25, the shark reef $17-$20. Don't even try the slots - They don't pay out. Which is why other casinos are much more crowded. The location of the hotel is located next to the airport (noisy). Be Very Careful for the elevators they close quickly whether you're in the doorway or not, very dangerous! Buffet and restaurants are very pricey for what is offered. Beligio is much nicer and less$$$. Excaliber(more kids here) and Luxor have one price buffet all day come and go as you please and a better quality and selection of food. Do not try walking outside of the hotel very dangerous - take the tram or moving walkway to Luxor and Excaliber and then walk from there, but be prepared for a lot of walking. If you have a car use to go to the other hotel which have free Valet parking (just tip) for everyone!! We been to Vegas before and enjoyed it - after this visit I don't care if we ever go back and I can assure it will not be at the Mandalay Bay.

Overall, there were 3 lightbulbs burnt out, the fridge was broken, there was hair in the bathtub and in the sink, and the clock radio did not work. Suprised and dissapointed, I was clear that room cleanliness was not at the top of the priority list so I decided I had better check the bed for you know what. As I pulled the blanked back, you could see the mattress because they didn't even have a fitted sheet on the bed! As I said already, i am a hotel general manager and this was almost unbelievable to me? Aside from the room experience, the hotel, casino, convention space, and employees were 100% amazing. The convention was great, the gambling was even better, and the employees all had smiles and were very pleasant. I guess this is what you get when you have a unionized work force cleaning rooms."

The staff were very rude and unfriendly. If they had a band playing they charged 18% on food and drinks but, never told you. I had a vodka tonic that was $12.00 it tasted like alka seltzer just what I needed when iI got the bill. The staff would be on an elevator with you and never speak or make eye contact.

    "content": "My husband and I were in Vegas to celebrate our anniversary and chose to stay in Mandalay Bay because there were so many restaurants on property that we wanted to try. This included Fleur de Lys where we had eaten before and celebrating our anniversary there was the basis for our trip. Unfortunately, Fleur de Lys closed for renovations about two weeks before we arrived and our tickets were already booked so it was too late to change to our favorite hotel. When we arrived Thursday afternoon we had no wait for a room and they were able to accommodate our request for a Strip view and even waived the normal $25 upcharge. We did have to settle for 2 queen beds, but for the amazing strip view we found ourselves with, it was a small price to pay (or not pay, as it were). When we arrived to the room, I opened to the door to the toilet room and found a wet, dirty towel on the floor, so I went to the housekeepers in the hallway, showed them the towel and asked them to clean the bathroom (since it was pretty clear this had been missed when the room was cleaned). They agreed and then we waited another \u00bd hour. No one came so I went out and asked them again. It is pretty clear that they didn\u2019t understand what the problem was because two housekeepers came in and gave us extra toiletries and slippers in what was obviously a language barrier, and my Spanish wasn\u2019t strong enough to explain the problem. I was able, with patience and a bit of pantomime to explain that the bathroom hadn\u2019t been cleaned and this was finally taken care of very quickly and thoroughly. About 5 minutes after they left, someone, who I assume was a supervisor and was fluent in English knocked on the door to ask me what the problem was. I told him that the toilet area was not cleaned from previous guests, and I\u2019d just asked for it to be cleaned. I wasn\u2019t upset and he seemed relieved, was very gracious, and with that the vacation was allowed to continue! Overall, I have to say the furnishings of the room were a little bit worn and in general, the room wasn\u2019t very clean. There is a large floor to ceiling framed mirror as you enter the room and it was streaked, fingerprinted, and overall pretty dirty, so it doesn\u2019t give you greatest confidence about the room overall. I was reasonably happy with the stay. The early cleaning mishap was just a mistake and they cheerfully corrected without giving me an attitude and all the staff that we encountered were very helpful and pleasant. I love the restaurants in Mandalay Bay but it really is far up the strip and if you\u2019re not coming to the hotel to use the pool, which I hear is great but I didn\u2019t take advantage of myself, it\u2019s a bit isolated from the heart of the action. Checkout was also a breeze and the woman was sure to ask if I had tried the bottle of wine that was charged to my account from the mini bar. She also directed us to the bell desk, who held our bags while we had breakfast before heading to the airport, which was really convenient. Overall, we\u2019ll probably go back to our favorite property on future trips\u2026but we\u2019ll still make it to Fleur de Lys, or whatever the new incarnation of the restaurant is called when it reopens!"

The view of the strip is nice, but still 1/2 airport view. Don't expect a full nights sleep either, it's a party atmosphere and the many young patrons don't understand how to stop the door from slamming and the soundproofing is very poor. Housekeeping is marginal to good, each day there was something forgotten or not done, i.e. vacuuming, ice bucket emptied, bath mat not replaced but hung up wet, etc... Had a light bulb out day 1 and requested it replaced via maintenance dept; 7 days later it was still out. Mattress had an indentation that was noticeable and bothersome. Accosted by salespeople in the lobby area lower level at 7 am on the way to the fitness center, was told she could get rid of the bags under my eyes for only $300, no wonder I had bags, the guest next to me kept banging his door all night long, even so, I didn't have makeup on and wasn't prepared or open for commentary on the state of my aging facial features at 7am! If your going for an event at the conference center make SURE to take several flat comfortable shoes, the walk to the conference center is excruciatingly long and some of the floors are uneven-horrible for heels for even one day. One of the 4 beach pools was closed during the entire stay. Several days, 2 of 4 were closed and guests were made to pack in like sardines instead of spreading out and enjoying the entire space. It would have been much nicer to have a bit more than the space of a 3' x 5' lounge chair for more privacy (without having to pay an extra $250 for a private cabana!). I'm sure this was done to cut expenses and staffing. Most annoying part of the beach? **Warning to parents** YOU HAVE TO PAY $18-25 FOR EACH TUBE AT THE LAZY RIVER. They do not rent or provide tubes. This is not mentioned on the website. Food is expensive at the Beach also ($12 for a turkey sandwich, fries and 10 oz. plastic cup of tea). A great pool area for families if you can afford it, but seems to cater more to the \"beautiful people\". Enjoyed a massage at the Spa, great environment, facility and staff, but I had bruising over 1/3 of my body the next day, they take their deep tissue massages very seriously! The good points? The grounds are lovely and well maintained, the pools were clean and well kept. The staff were friendly and approachable. For the size of the hotel, the elevators were usually quick. Nice selection of restaurants in reasonable price ranges. American women: The Retail stores cater to small sized younger styles, no sizes over a 12 were available in any of the clothing stores."

The wave pool and lazy river pool were both great. Not too crowded since it was after labor day. Getting a lounge was a little tough, we had to wait for people to leave. We ate breakfast at the buffet which was great! We saw the Shark reef aquarium which was pretty cool as well. The hotel is huge, so be ready to walk a lot just in the hotel alone."

They rudely informed us that we had been upgraded to the MGM Grand, upgrade, that is a joke. Huh, at least give us a call or an email prior to our arrival and let us know of your major error before we get to the hotel. They moved other convention guests to the Bellagio but we were thrown to the lion over at the dump they call the MGM Grand. When we asked them to at least move us to the Bellagio they said \"No exceptions, you are going to the MGM or we will give you nothing\". Very hostile staff. Extremely unprofessional behavior. They comped our less than luxurious rooms and gave us cab fare because we had to travel back and forth to the convention center. NEVER AGAIN WILL I STAY AT MANDALAY BAY, be forewarned before you book this overrated hotel. NO EXCEPTIONS!"

    "content": "First, let me tell you I have been to Vegas several times..staying at Caesars several times, Excalibur, Bellagio, Treasure Island, Tahiti Village, Palazzo And about 8 years ago at MB. 8 Years ago MB was a beautiful property, great service and very clean. My wife, 2 boys 6/2 yrs. old, and Mother in law had adjoining rooms checked in on a Wed late afternoon. Went to the rooms and noticed there was some trash in front of 1 of our rooms but thought it may be from someone walking in the hall. Went into the room and found a cleaning rag on the table, bathroom toilet appeared to have some vomit or something on it, bed looked like someone just slept in it and pulled the covers over and on the windows hand,finger and lip prints all over it. Went into the adjoining room and hand,finger and lip marks all over the windows and 1 bed also looked like someone just slept in it. Call the front desk and they moved us to another adjoining room after stating they didn't have one. Got to the new rooms and they appeared to better, bellman dropped the bags and we started to unpack and started noticing things were not very clean and once again hand,finger and lip prints all over the windows..I was starting to wonder if it was part of the decor. Called down again and they said they would give us a 50.00 credit per room. Next day wife went to the spa and liked the girl that did her service and my wife asked if she would be doing her service on Monday. I booked a day at the spa for my wife's BDay , gave them my CC to reserve it. The girl checked the book and said there was no services scheduled.....wife no even more irritated not so much there was no appointment but our Credit Card number was given to someone!!! The girl told my wife the spa used to be packed and tough to get anything booked but ever since MGM Properties took MB over things have gone way down hill. The furniture such as bureaus as the originals...bad shape , water stains, the down button on our floors elevator was missing, the halls themselves visibly worn, needing paint and carpeting...room carpets..disgusting. We rented a Cabana and my brother asked me if I had looked under the fridge unit and I said no, he said when you have a chance take a look. I looked behind it and there were 2 empty beer bottles and an empty cup, my brother said you need to look under...there were at least 6 empty beer bottles and 2 wine glasses...for $250.00 per cabana one would expect it to be clean!!! Rented a cabana another day and told they had \"upgraded\" the location....they didn't upgrade us..that section of the pool was closed..that is why they moved us. Rented a Cabana another day, it was a private Cabana with a pool and hot tub. It appeared to be a private spot nice and quiet but there was that smell...the smell of raw sewage seeping from the bathroom behind the cabana. It was very strong and the wind was blowing right into the area. Cabana host told us if they flushed the toilets the smell would go away....the Cabana boy came over and had a slightly different story...his story was they have been over there 3 times looking for the problem and they could not locate it and I told him what the Cabana host said and he smirked and said not true the smell will not go away...I went to the host and said I'll take a credit I can smell sh*t for free. The smell also could be detected on the lazy river even the life guard said it was strong. Life guard in the bathroom at least 5 minutes as I changed my 2 year old..he was texting the whole time...hope know one was drowning...may have been on break but please at least hide away from the guests. Took my son down one late afternoon 3:30 and come to find out the pool was closing at 4pm...they never told anyone in the hotel..it was a private party and I was told the employees just found out about it...please....Delloit was in for 2 weeks it had been planned for months. A woman on the elevator was wild...she said I am a paying guest too. Lot of the staff are kids and they could care less and 1 person I spoke to who has been there since it opened said they have gotten rid of a lot of former employees, they can pay the kids less. In a nutshell everything that Kirk Kerkorian buys he runs into the ground. The company wants quantity not quality and could care less about the visitors. Essentially slum lords of hotels. The property is way to far from the center of the strip and has deeply declined in cleanliness and service.Not to mention the nickle diming with the \"resort fee\" another lie and BS charge. As mentioned before I have stayed at many hotels in Vegas..this one will never be visited again and as far as I am concerned the employees said it all and I will not patronize any other MGM Properties. Pay a little extra to stay at the Palazzo(which I spent 1 night while I was there this trip) for good service, cleanliness and location...you will be glad you did."

The hotel is very well presented and caters for everything and everybody. Our room was on the 29th floor and was a very spacious twin room, with large bathroom and plenty of storage. The views were amazing and on checking in, the staff very helpful. The Concierge booked us tickets for the show that we wanted straight away and everybody that we dealt with at the hotel was great. We didn't have to pay a resort fee that some people have mentioned on here (not too sure why, but this was not mentioned or charged to us at any time). The pool and beach area is great, yes very busy, but it's a huge hotel and has a massive amount of guests staying at any one time, but was very clean and tidy. The Mix Bar on the 64th floor of The Hotel at Mandalay Bay next door was certainly an experience and offered amazing views of Vegas at night, which you would only really get from the Stratosphere. Only thing that I would say is that if I went again, I would maybe stay further up the Strip as we got taxis quite regularly to other hotels. It's not miles away from everything but with the properties being so big, it can take a good walk in the heat to get to where you want to be (there is a monorail however that also goes from the Mandalay via the Luxor to Excalibur). Overall though, excellent value for the price that we paid and would strongly recommend it to anybody deciding on where to stay in Vegas."

Bath full of dirt on arrival and greasy forehead marks on the windows where previous guests had been looking out. Pool has no shade at all unless you want to pay $250 for a cabana or extra for \"reserved\"seating which offered you an umbrella and bed cushions. Lazy river ok but they charged $25 for a blow up ring to use it. Wave pool?? There were so many rules, we gave up. Laft side of the blue line. WHISTLE. Right side of the blue line WHISTLE. Forward, backwards WHISTLE WHISTLE WHISTLE. We strolled into the water and stoppped to decide which way to go and... you guessed it... $15 for internet, $4 for small bottle of water etc etc The one very annoying thing is that of there ws a wedding they blocked off the main entrance to the Hotel which forced you to walk around the car park, through bushes, to get onto the road. I did not find the hotel friendly at all. We went for the biuffet breakfast once. Chaos. Queues, dirty tables, no clearance and then they close one side to prepare for lunch.

That said the hotel was very good, and provided a degree of calm we didn't see elsewhere in Vegas. We walked past or through most \"Strip\" hotels, and thought that Mandalay Bay, Bellagio and the Wynn looked a cut above. Each to their own but the \"themed\" hotels like Excalibur and Luxor were too kitsch for our taste. The Mandalay Bay has good facilities with a wide choice. We ate at 4 places on site, and also had room service - all were good. Portions were huge, and not too expensive. Ate at \"The Mix\" in THEhotel @ Mandalay Bay, which was amazing - both the food and the views (64th floor). Our room was large, clean and had a great Strip view (which we requested on booking, but which did not incur a supplementtary charge). Plenty to do in the hotel with an aquarium, fantastic beach/pool area and shopping at Mandalay Place. Bought a daily \"hop-on/hop-off\" bus ticket which can be used on the Strip \"Deuce\" bus, or the extended Gold Line which goes to the shopping outlets - and costs only $7 for 24 hours - bus stop in both directions directly outside Mandalay Bay. Also recommend the Grand Canyon trip (we took the coach trip option) which is unmissable. We also had a great week without gambling a single dollar - so it can be done. All in all a high quality accommodation - and if our money was unlimitted.....??????......well, we'd go for a suite at THEhotel (which one of our party did), which were very very luxurious and made for a special occasion."

    "content": "I wrote a gleaming review about Mandalay a couple years back after feeling disillusioned by everything at The Mirage, which had been my previous Vegas resort of choice. But I think it's about time I pack up my game and head back north on the strip. Good things first: the pool was still awesome, albeit crowded even on a Tuesday afternoon. Restaurant service was consistently great during our stay. Bell staff were quick and efficient; they probably deserved their tips more so than anyone else. Dealers were friendly for the most part, and pit bosses were fairly generous with comps after gambling at $25 tables for a couple hours. Valet service was hit or miss: some were kind enough to ask if we needed directions, but others didn't even bother to close our doors after taking their tip. Now for what has gone way downhill, on top of what was already mentioned. The check-in process was more nightmarish than usual... Mandalay does a particularly bad job with line control in the lobby. Lobby staff were very inconsistent, some with very gruff attitudes. Hopefully it's not a normal occurrence, but our room wasn't ready until 2 hours past the official check-in time. Adding insult to injury, our room was filthy when we arrived. Even worse, some of the mess made by our room's previous occupants was still there after a SECOND DAY'S cleaning... kind of illustrates the amount of pride housekeeping has about their jobs. Mandalay Bay is indeed a good value, particularly on weekdays and arguably still so on weekends... but so are others on the strip, and with Mandalay you really seem to get what you pay for these days. Until they clean up their act (literally), I'll be taking my business back to The Mirage."

    "content": "I stayed at Mandalay Bay in October and had a great time so I booked again in April for my next visit 2 hours after arriving at the hotel I slipped in the lounge on the dance floor. The waitress called security which came and asked me what I wanted to do, I said go to my room and ice my ankle. I had to wait for the person to take pictures and was also made to fill out an accident report before I could go to my room. I made it up to the room about 20 minutes later and decided to go to the hospital so I called down to the front desk and asked for an ambulance. While I was being loaded in the ambulance my partner was told by security she would have to take a cab to the hospital but was finally allowed to ride in the ambulance by the paramedics. Five hours later I returned in a cab with a broken ankle and was made to wait outside for 15 minutes with the meter running in the cab while they retreived a wheelchair I was told I would have to pay $35 a day to rent the wheelchair even though I slippped and fell in their casino. During my stay I did not receive one call from any staff as to how I was making out or coping. My friend called the next day to complain and never received a call back. I called on my last day to acquire about getting a copy of the form I filled out at the time of the accident. I complained to staff on how badly I was treated and was forced to pay for a wheelchair. I eventually got the wheelchair charge removed. I was out of work for 3 months from the accident and did not even get an apology. I would never stay at Mandalay Bay again because of how bad the customer service was that weekend."

Having been to Mandalay bay a few times before for concerts at the event center and theater I knew a little about the hotel. It was a bit swanky and nice but had no idea what I was in for when I booked a room. The Valet staff were very courteous and helpful. Getting our car out of valet took 5 minutes on average. Check in was a breeze, although the housekeeping was a bit lacking. First off, we requested a mini fridge before arrival and when we got to the hotel. After checking in late at night and waiting 40 minutes (with 3 calls to the front desk) we gave up and canceled the fridge. Also the one occasion I had to interact with housekeeping and ask for an extra towel one of the maids got very defensive and almost rude about it. The rooms however made up for any unpleasant feelings we had from the fridge and the housekeeper. First of all they are probably 1.5 times bigger than rooms at Las Vegas hilton, NYNY, Paris, Ballys etc. Very nice and spacious! The decor was pretty to look at and the bathroom had very generous counter space. I am a girl that does NOT pack light and there was ample closet space. The TV in the bathroom was great too so football could be watched. The bed was soft... take that how you will. The only drawback to the room were the paper thin walls. Heard neighbors on both sides, people above us walking around and dropping things and drunks in the hallway at all hours of the night. But this didn't really bother me cause its vegas. What do you expect? On to the rest of mandalay bay. There is so much to do here you really don't need to leave. Many restaurants, Shark reef aquarium, House of blues, Musical theater, Convention center, tattoo parlor, shopping, and a BEACH for crying out loud. The casino had a nice assortment of games and smelled like coconut. Yummy! Also a plus was the good air filter systems since I get bothered by the heavy smoking at some casinos. Sadly did not visit the pool (I kick myself) but we were there for a short weekend. Did however go to the starbucks and Mandalay Place shopping. I will let you in on a secret, if you like urban outfitters this one is one of my top favorite. Nice layout and I always find something..... always. We also chose to eat at Raffles cafe since it was the first place we stumbled to out of our room. The 2000 island (yes, thats right) dressing was awesome and all the food was delicious. All 3 plates were licked clean. Its definitely on par with some of the really nice strip hotels and far better than MOST of them which seemed to go downhill. I would not hesitate to stay here again and thats saying ALOT since I tend to be loyal to a few other Strip hotels. Mandalay bay has made its way into my favorites :)"

Mix upstairs is great, we didn't eat there but hung out there late night for drinks. The view is unbelievable from the patio. The Foundation Room also had a great view. Moorea Beach club was a blast to hang out at with friends and listen to good music and have drinks. The drinks are very pricey though!!!!! The other pool which is on the beach is nice too. It gets very packed and is hard to find a chair, but we asked the guys that worked there and they came over w/ chairs for us in no time! My one complaint was that I scheduled a wake-up call for the morning we were leaving and they never called!!! Thank god I woke up on my own! I would definetly stay at Mandalay Bay again though."

The service at check in and check out was very poor with long lines, no order whatsoever to the line system. Housekeeping did not clean our room on two separate days, and when asked to leave extra towels they would only leave bath size towels, not hand towels or wash cloths. We complained to the front desk about housekeeping and we were credited $50 in food to our account, but they neglected to tell us we could only use the credits at Red, White, Blue restaurant or the Bayside Buffet. We tried to use it at Raffles but got charged anyway. Also the wireless internet was not working one day and we had to call for assistance. Yes the pool is very nice, but it is not worth the hassle and stress of dealing with the downsides, especially for the money we paid to stay there."

Although we had a view of the airport outside our huge floor to ceiling window, we did get to watch the sun rise over the mountains in the morning - beautiful! Staff were friendly and there were plenty of places to eat at any hour of the day. Only downside was that we felt the wifi access was quite expensive ($15 / day).

Now for the drawbacks. They tack on a resort fee whether you use the amenities or not. I would think that the resort fee would ensure a place to sit by the pool. However, this year they roped off 2 big areas at the pool for VIP seating. These areas remained virtually empty, while the rest of us had to wait for someone to leave before we could find empty beach chairs. We probably could have paid for a chair in the roped off area, but why do that when we already paid a resort fee? Also, there were tons of kids at the pool. This is Vegas, not Disneyland! There were so many, it was hard to get into the pool (never mind the lack of seating because everyone's kids were there). The guests seemed a little more WT than in the past and I had a hard time keeping from tripping over strollers and float tubes in the hallways. Used to be able to get comped drinks when we were playing the machines. One bartender was hospitable, but he was replaced by a bartender that told us that we had to play at least a dollar a spin to get a drink. He told someone next to us that he had to play $100 a roll to get a free straight shot, and the shots weren't even out of a bottle (hose and gun). Also, I got tired of the smoke in the casino and at the pool. Nothing grosser than sitting in the sun and having someone sit next to you and light up a nasty smelling cancer stick!"

Someone else with my name booked rooms the following weekend and the front desk clerk was confused. We finally figured it out. Got to our rooms, which were great. Nice big bathroom and comfy beds. I wish it came with a fridge to store some alcoholic beverages or leftover food to eat after consuming said beverages. One morning we woke up and decided we wanted coffee. So we ordered coffee through room service. After waiting an HOUR ( not really upset about that) we were charged $2.50 PER coffee cup to drink our coffee out of. Are you serious?? Wow. That made me very angry and just pretty much ruined the appreciation of the hotel. It is a little amount, but come on. Do they also charge per plate/utensil? Also the resort fee is a joke. We didnt have any waters in the room, use the workout facility or the wi-fi. What a waste of $50. I enjoyed myself more at the Excalibur, which is considered a lesser star hotel. Next time I'm staying someplace else."

The staff and customer service were fantastic, I'd missed my connection and the Mandalay Bay sent a another Limo for the new flight time which was great. (I had a limo already booked with them) Got upgraded to a 750 suite strip view suite on check in, which was nice and spacious as I was travelling with my mother. Loved the HUGE bathroom!! Went to Mix Lounge one evening, wow what a amazing view of the strip!! The staff at VIP services need to get a shout out for the fantastic service we received, would definitely stay there again."

The service here was HORRIBLE. We were paying over $1600USD to stay in this place for three nights and the only person I found pleasant to speak with were the concierges when they were giving us tips on nightclubs and dinner. Check-in was horrible, it seemed as if they didn't have us on record, because the girl had to keep asking other people who looked like managers questions...even though we had paid over $300 deposit to reserve the room. She gave us two free drink coupons for our troubles...which is what they give you anyway for booking a room. I told her we would need more than that as there were four of us. The room was very nice, but there was no corkscrew...in a wet bar. We're wine drinkers, so we learned after the first night that we'd have to buy screw caps because get this...I called down for a corkcrew and the girl sarcastically said \"I'll bring that right up\", then never arrived. An hour later we were in desperate need of a corkscrew so I called again and another woman told me we would be charged $2 for them to bring one up and it would take about 45 minutes. We were planning to tip the person who brought it up...is it necessary to charge for this? We decided to just go down and buy one from the gift shop. It was one of the very basic ones and made it EXTREMELY difficult to open our bottles (we stuck with screw cap). The first night we tried to go to Raffles for a verrry early morning breakfast...and ended up having to wait an hour in line and then leaving out of frustration. The second night one of the girls and I went to Raffles for some breakfast and it was actually pretty good and we had some entertainment when the table accross from us got into a fist fight and had to be dragged out by security. THIS was my worst exerience with the staff: my friend ordered room service. She ordered the croissant sandwich with HASH BROWNS. Where we come from, hash browns are any kind of breakfast potatoes. They arrived 40 minutes later and were extremely cold and stale. We were just about to head out after, and we didn't want to wait another 40 minutes for new hash browns, but we also didn't want to have to pay $23 for a mediocre breakfast sandwich and stale hash browns. I called room service to see if they would at least deduct some part of the charge for room service from our bill and they forwarded me to a manager who was extremely rude and all he said was \"hash browns don't come with the croissant, breakfast potatoes do\" and I said \"oh ok sorry, we call them hash browns in Canada\" and he said \"ya ok well I'll send someone up for the plate and we'll see about your refund\". I know he did this to make sure we were actually so dissatisfied with the \"breakfast potatoes\" that they were not eaten - and they weren't. So he sent someone up for the plate (much speedier than the actual room service) and when she arrived I asked her politely if the charge would be reduced and she said \"ok I'll talk to the manager\" and that was the last we heard. Of course the charge of $23+tip ended up on our bill at the end of our trip, but by that point we just wanted out of the whole experience with their staff. However, I will be writing a letter about the level of customer service I expect to receive when paying a large amount of money to stay at a mediocre hotel. Other than that, Vegas was awesome for a first timer and we will be returning - but definitely not to Mandalay Bay."

The location of the hotel is at the far end of the strip, good for sun worshippers as the pools are bathed with sunshine from 8am which is great! unfortunately there are 5 pools none with any significant shade available. With a 2 yr old absolutely no umberellas were in situ and with the temp at 110 degrees, this is too much for most people to put up with. I assume this is due to the fact they want you to hire a cabana tent some days these were $250 per day, other days $550! had a few meals at the hotel 1 at the fish place moonen I think the chefs name was, wasn't impressed at all. In fact the Mandalay Bay was actually the worst hotel for food, we also ate in the New York New York at Gallaghers (steak) was absolutely fabulous (and cheaper than MBay!) room was nice and clean, coffee maker was provided, although no cups and no coffee materialised! and you couldn't seem to buy it at the hotel, ended up going down the lift to take out Starbucks every morning. attended a wedding at the mandalay bay, At the end of the day, glad I experienced this hotel, although I wouldn't necessarily want to stay there again, reasons are the Hotel is a bit far out of the action/other major hotels, there is no shade whilst sunbathing, food in the hotel wasn't great (had better elsewhere). Having visited nearly all the other Hotel options, I would stay at the Bellagio next time !"

The location is ok, next to Luxor, but I'm not aware of a tram or shuttle that will take you further down the Strip towards Caesar's Palace and Wynn. The swimming pools are probably what distinguishes this place from other Vegas properties. However, there's not alot of shade and the staff were not proactive in removing floating debris from the lazy river. You can get great deals on midweek stays and I'd consider going there again."

    "content": "I just got back from the Mandalay Bay resort with my husband and son. The best thing about this hotel is the pool. If you do not have any intentions of using it, then you may want to consider someplace else. I traveled with a 9 year old who loves swimming and the wave pool and lazy river were right up his alley! I have to say, that I enjoyed the pool as well. However, it does get very crowded after 2:00 pm. BTW, you do not have to buy or rent the expensive tubes they have at the hotel. I saw MANY people using their own round tubes in the lazy river. One last thing about the pool, the sand and concrete become hot like burning lava so make sure you have your flip flops on walking to and from the pools. The hotel in general was very crowded but keep in mind there was an IRS convention, the Miss Universe Pageant and the \"Hoodie\" (whatever that may be) awards during our stay. Check in and check out times were very long. Check out was so long that I chose express checkout and much to my dismay, I received an email statement from the hotel and I was charged a resort fee of approx. $17.00 per day that I was unaware of. The rooms are showing their age. There were stains on the bedspread, throw pillows, rugs, lampshades and chairs... a bit too gross for me. The rooms were cleaned in a \"so-so\" fashion. Outside of the rooms, the halls and common areas are very clean and the outside grounds are very pretty and kept immaculate. The walls of the rooms are paper thin and you can hear everything in the room next door. This was quite annoying. The casino seemed on par with the others on the strip and the buffet and food in general was fine. Since the hotel is the last hotel on the strip, it can get quite expensive taking cabs up and down the strip. Take advantage of the free monorail to the Luxor and Excalibur to save a few bucks or a few steps to your destination on the strip. We went to the shark reef at the hotel which was a nice way to spend an hour and a half if you are into aquariums. One last thing.... Don't even touch the mini bar if you don't want to get charged. Have a great time. It is not the worst hotel there, but housekeeping can be improved and bring some extra cash!"

    "content": "After reading several reviews about this before going, I was really nervous with all the things that I saw and the complaints. But after going, I felt that the hotel was great and didn\u2019t have many complaints. Room- Bathroom- The rooms were very spacious and the bathroom was really big. I liked the big bathtub and separate showers. I also liked that the toilet was separate from the rest of the bathroom for privacy. The bathroom had a TV in it, which was nice and it came with lots of counter space and 2 separate sinks. Room-The room was very spacious and comfortable. It came with a desk, small sofa, and chair. The best thing about this was the bed. We asked for a King size, it really didn\u2019t look like, but it was suppose to be. The bed was very comfortable and came with several pillows. They also had extra pillows in the closet. I usually have a hard time sleeping away from home, but I slept great the whole time there. The air in the room didn\u2019t work that great. It wasn\u2019t hot in the room, but it seemed that the air didn\u2019t blow out as good. The room temperature was set at 60 degrees but it sure didn\u2019t feel that cool in the room. The only complaint that I have is it didn\u2019t have a microwave or refrigerator in the room and that was very inconvenient when we had left over food. I listened to everyone\u2019s advice about the mini bar and didn\u2019t not touch it or even look at. I also asked the front desk about the mini bar and they stated that everything is weighed so if you move it, it will automatically charge you. Also the walls are very thin and can hear others from the room next door, but luckily I was next to someone that wasn\u2019t loud at all. Pool-The wave pool was the best things there. I was able to get in the pool and have plenty of space and room to move around. It was beautiful and I can\u2019t find words to explain it. We didn\u2019t use the lazy river due to having to buy the inter-tube at the price of 25.00 dollars each. So we decided to stay in the pool. One caution: the sand is extremely HOT on your feet. I couldn\u2019t stand on it for long at all. All the pools were open, but again we used the wave pool the 3 days we were there. They supplied the towels for you and I contacted the front desk to see if they supplied lockers and they stated no and that you needed to bring only the bare minimum because people can walk around and take your stuff. We didn\u2019t have that problem at all. We ate at the Beach Bar and Grill, prices were a little high but you had to expect that. Restaurants- We ate at The Raffles several times we were there. The food was okay very pricey and not many selections as I would have liked. The only complaint is that I had to see 2 people vomit right next to me while eating 2 different times. I talked with the manager they didn\u2019t make us pay for our food and apologized for that. I would have liked to see more restaurants open later then 11. Casino- It was very big and I thank god for signs because I was so confused, but not a problem. The waitresses were very nice and came around several times to get our drink orders. I was surprised due to the place being so BIG. Elevators & Kids- I saw that a lot of people complained about the wait time for elevators. We didn\u2019t have that problem at all. We were there from Wednesday to Saturday and didn\u2019t have to wait at all. I did see a lot of kids but not too overwhelming for me. Maybe they were getting ready for school. Shark Reef- All I can say is a waste of time being there and not worth the 17.00 dollars a person to be there. It was not big at all and again not worth the money. I have spent better money at the Shed Aquarium in Chicago. Front Desk& Baggage Attendants- I also saw several complaints about staff at the hotel and I will say they everyone that I had an encounter with, was very pleasant. No complaints there. Also I was not charged the 15.00 dollar resort fee, it was waived. Overall, I was very pleased with this establishment and I would come back here again. All I can say about reading reviews is, you will need to use your own judgment to see if you really like it."

You could not go in the wave pool without a fear of being knocked over by a kid. Next to our room was a family with kids that woke every morning at 7 a.m. and you could hear them. The Adult pool is no longer topless. Why? because the rooms over look the adult pool and the kids could see a topless female, Oh My! I don't get it...You walk down the streets of Vegas and everywhere are \"business cards\" of call girs with their totally naked picture on them for kids to see. The adult pool cost $50 per person (even if you are staying at the hotel) and you DON'T get a chair to sit on. A chair is an extra $50. No outside drinks/food permitted. Their drinks are $12 - $15 each. They checked my bag and patted down my husband for any outside drinks/ food. The only place they didn't check was under my cover-up. The pool DJ plays the music too loud and for the first two hours was all Techno music. There are a couple of old guys and one dike female in uniform walking the pool area, trying to look \"cool\" but they looked \"creepy\" to me. These uniformed employees are to inforce pool rules. No jumping in water, no splashing, no outside food/drinks, no sitting in a chair unless you paid $50, no laying your towel by a cabana that you did not pay $100 for, No removing tops etc....in otherwords NO FUN! There is a mantatory $17/night Fee added to your final bill. We booked on-line through Expedia and still had to pay the additional $17 per night. The hotel is a long way from other sites. If you stay here expect to walk long distances to other sites, expect to visit another hotels adult pool that is fun! Expect several kids. I saw kids walking and running in the casino area! Who are these parents that bring their kids to Vegas?"

    "content": "Great Stay at \u201cMandy Bay\u201d! My husband and I arrived to MB and check in was a breeze, no line up at all! We walked right up to the friendly accommodating front desk clerk. That being said, he mentioned that it was extremely busy a few hours prior so perhaps we were lucky. We had reserved the 750 square foot king suite for our anniversary weekend\u2026nice! It was clean; close to the elevators just past the pop/ice machine and had a great strip view. It also had a flat screen in the bathroom which was kind of cool. Mandalay Bay itself is very large, clean, airy (not smoky or dark) and very posh. I was a little worried from previous trip reviews that we would be overrun with children, but that wasn\u2019t the case at all. Not that we don\u2019t love kids (we have four of our own) but we consider Vegas our adult getaway. I would agree there probably are more families at this hotel but not so many kids that it was bothersome in any way. In fact I would think it would be more bothersome to have a crowd of obnoxious dunk people! MB is at the very end of the strip, we knew this going in and we have been to Vegas several times so being in the center was not a priority to us. We choose Mandalay Bay for the pool, restaurants, and room. There is a tram that takes you to the Excalibur and it\u2019s a quick walk to reach the MGM if you want to start your \u201cstrip walks\u201d from that point. Other times we would just simply cab it, like for the Jersey Boys show at the Palazzo (awesome) and the Tim Allen show at the Mirage (very good). We rented a Cabana on Saturday\u2026that was very relaxing and we both agree that Cabana\u2019s are the way to go for every future Vegas pool day. Loved it. We did the spa on Sunday, massage and facials, nice, no complaints, we\u2019ve been to many spas and this wasn\u2019t the most fabulous experience ever but it was very nice. We had a dinner at Mix for our anniversary, tried the tasting menu. Service was outstanding as the view and atmosphere but so was the price. I\u2019d recommend going for a drink instead of a meal. We enjoyed our cheaper meal at Freemont (Firefly) more! Have a burger at the Burger Bar in MB\u2026I liked it better than Stripburger. The Raffles caf\u00e9 in MB very good and had extremely large portions, we ate approximately half our meals. House of Blues is fun too, great music. We didn\u2019t find MB to be as crowded as the other hotels we\u2019ve stayed at, no line ups, no bumping into people when walking the casino etc. It could be because it didn\u2019t get the strip traffic other hotels do or because the economy is down a bit. Service was great, lots of waitresses when gambling. Housekeeping was so-so, the bed was comfortable and clean but we noticed that they didn\u2019t clean the table area of our suite. We didn\u2019t have a problem with the location but I can see how some people woukld especially if it\u2019s their first trip to Vegas. If you book here, know that it\u2019s not the super party hotel, but great for a romantic trip. All in all we had a fantastic time and loved the \u201cMandy Bay.\u201d"

Very unorganised for such a suave hotel. Only time in over 3 weeks of constant travel where we had a bad experience - staff really really not nice at check-in area and lines totally unorganised. Room was however lovely, bathroom wonderful & inspite of arrival difficulties & getting very angry with a little lady who decided we hadn't been in the various queues for over 30 mins ...! (great customer relations by the way little lady) we put it behind us and had a nice evening, however it left a bad taste.

    "content": "This is my second review of the Mandalay Bay here on T.A. We went in August 2009. We stayed at Mandalay Bay from Sunday, August 8 to Friday, August 13, 2010. My wife and 2 children (9 and 5 years) came back to MB for the second year in a row for an August summer vacation in Vegas. I'm a member of the MGM Mirage Players Club and booked using this Club to get $69 for first 3 nights and $99 for last 2 nights. I'm not a heavy gambler, but I do enough gambling with Club card to get discounts with the 12 or so hotels in Vegas which are owned by MGM Mirage. There is an additional $15/night resort fee which includes internet access, gym access, etc. This new additional daily resort fee went into effect around May 1, 2010. Make sure to factor this cost in when making reservations. We paid in cash in full for all 5 nights when we checked in and did NOT place a credit card on file. My promotion involved a $25 food and beverage credit, ONLY if I had a credit card on file. We still elected to NOT have a credit card on file and didn't use the $25 credit. We are paranoid about bogus charges hotels will sometimes put on your bill (when a CC is on file) which you have to dispute, such as you or a child slightly touching a snack from the motion-sensored shelf in the room! Cash is still king! When we checked in, we were given a room which was not fully clean! The initial room had vomit on the ceiling and on the bed comforter. I immediately called the front desk from this dirty room and said this room was unacceptable! The front desk promptly reassigned us to another room which was clean. My wife, the bed expert, scoped out the beds in the new room to check for any signs of \"bed bugs\" which have been in the news lately. We had a standard room with 2 queen beds. MB has the best sized, equipped standard rooms I've ever been in! Not many hotels have 2 queen sized beds in a \"standard\" room. My advice is do not call the bell hop to bring up your luggage until you are satisfied with the room. Otherwise, you will be packing again and moving your luggage to another room. This is a \"kid friendly\" hotel! I'm glad there are hotels like this in Las Vegas. Many people on here get irritated about the number of children at MB and in Vegas in general. I recommend staying at the newer hotels in the middle of the Strip if you want a romantic getaway with your significant other. The pools were great as usual, except there was one day when the pool water was colder than the previous days and my kids didn't want to swim anymore. As the ambient temperature became hotter each day while we were there, it seemed like MB didn't heat the pools as much. We ate at restaurants OFF the strip because of better food with lower prices. Check out Hash House A Go Go and Battista's Hole in the Wall!! We drove our own car to Vegas (no air fare, no rental car). We do this so we can hit attractions way off the Strip which most people who fly into Vegas don't have time or money to do. The one restaurant at MB we ate at was The Border Grill. This restaurant was featured on a Top Chef episode on Bravo. Well, all I can say is... Don't believe the hype! Over-promised, under-delivered, over-priced. My 5 year old daughter could not hold her scorching hot $4.75 Quesadilla until hours later back at our room. There were hidden charges like \"filtered water\" at $0.50 for each person and $9 for the guacamole which came with our chips in the beginning. We were asked if we wanted guacamole with the chips, but didn't think it would be $9 more. Our server and the manager offered to remake/recook my daughter's quesadilla, but it wouldn't make any difference because by the time the second quesadilla was made, the first quesadilla would be cooled off and we would be ready to leave anyways. Honestly, I was expecting some kind of \"credit\" on our bill, at least on the quesadilla, for our inconvenience, but there was no credit on our bill for anything. I guess the manager is paid on commission. All in all, we will likely come back to Mandalay Bay again because it's family friendly and luxurious at the same time. On a side note, some family activities we did which others may not know about are: Las Vegas Mini Gran Prix- Go karts for all ages! very fun Lied's Discovery Children Museum- This will keep them busy for a while! King Putt Indoor Miniature Golf- In Henderson and North Las Vegas, good way to beat the heat! International Scouting Museum- Huge collection of Boy Scout, Girl Scout Memorabilia from countries all over the world."

Room was excellent with everything you expect from a high end hotel. In terms of the reception etc its nice but not spectacular, check in was quick and check out via the TV was easy and remember this place has no casino so its a 5 minute walk to the MB casinoa. My only negatives would be the fact that we didnt get a turn down service in the evening and the pool area was absoloutely packed. whilst i appreciate the fact that August is probarly the busiest month for the pool we paid $100 dollars for two sun beds (as every other bed was taken - and there was hundreds!!) we didnt even get an umbrella to shade us from the blistering sun. when i looked round the huge pool area there was less than 20 umbrellas in the entire, huge, pool area which didnt make any sense to me. the only other issue is the location as The Hotel is at the end of the strip and you have to go through Mandalay Bay, Luxor & Excalibur on your way out and follow the same route on your way back in and after a few days walking the same route twice a day it does become a bit boring. whilst this isnt neccesarily a major problem if you stay more central on the strip, and trust me we have, you can get a more varied trip in and out of your hotel on every occasion. overall and good trip and glad we had good experience at THE Hotel but as the old saying goes \" some many hotels in Vegas - so little time\"......"

My nephew really enjoyed the wave pool although it was hard to find a seat. That was the only thing there for someone his age. We purchased the allday buffet pass for $38 on one of the days. The food was just OK. By dinner we were sick of the buffet and opted not to do this again the next day. I thought my room was clean until I pulled back the sheets and found makeup. The maid quickly changed the sheets for me. We also got locked out of the room for a few hours due to the battery in the door dying. The hotel itself was too far down the strip and the tram only took you as far as the Excalibur/MGM for free. I enjoyed staying in the middle of the strip much better the last time. The shops in the hotel were not that great and I didnt want to do any shopping there. Overall, the hotel was decent, but I will not be back there anytime soon."

    "content": "We've stayed at Mandalay many times and we're never dissappointed. We go to Vegas several times a year and we try to stay here once a year because our kids love the pool. I like the fact that the casino is huge enough that you don't have to squeeze thru chairs to get to a slot machine. Now some people my not like this cuz they don't want to walk this huge space. I can understand that, it can also turn a person around a little. Things I like= The casino space, variety of pools, plenty of places to eat at any time of the day, they are always able to get me a room with a view of the strip with no issue, the staff is always great to us and even comped us a few meals because I saw a spot on the bathroom floor, the breakfast buffet is awesome(handmade omelets, waffles etc.) The beds are comfy What I didn't like= there is only one bank of elevators so if you're coming in/out at a popular time, expect to wait. You can't order food from you sun lounger by the pool you have to fetch it yourself, the place is big so if you don't know yourself around you may get lost, it's not in the middle of the strip so if you want to go clubbin, you're cabbin it or takin the monorail. The rooms, although clean, need to be remodeled. Our room was comped so we checked in at \"invited guest\" check in so I can't talk about how there were/weren't lines. Our wifi was also comped but I believe it costs around 14 bucks a day. Thank god they have starbucks in the hotel, fast breakfast. Sharkreef, okay for little ones around 7, but my 12 year old was bored. Good stay, always fun"

    "content": "If you are comfortable staying in a motel, frequently use the Greyhound bus, and look forward to having your anniversary dinner at the Home Town Buffet, then this is the hotel for you. If you have like high quality service, great food and clean surroundings, then run as fast as you can... I spend 4-5 months a year on the road with my business, and have vast experience staying in every quality and class of hotel imaginable. This is the first hotel in my 10 years of traveling that I've ever had to call the hotel manager to complain. Imagine checking into your hotel room and finding used dental floss on the bedside stand - then waiting for 3 hours for another room only to find a large spattering of blood on the bathroom floor. The phone was covered in a thick web of hair from the previous guest, and stains covered the door handles and light switches. Absolutely the most revolting experience I've ever had. Add in inatentive valet parking staff, long waits for everything (from checking in to catching an elevator to getting a meal), an argumentative front counter person upon check in, and more; I've experienced better service in a 1 or 2 star motel. Other pains: 1. The pool opens at 8:00 am and closes at 7:00 pm. 2. The cardio room is less equiped than my home gym. 3. The monorail broke down late in the evening and we were stuck at the Lexor. 4. The buffet is not worth your time - horrible selection of fruits and vegetables, quality and food taste was nauseating. Staff are overworked and it takes forever to get help - they didn't even wipe down the table we sat at, even after we asked them to. 5. There is no decent map or guide to the property - when things open and close, where different shops and facilities are, and so on. 6. The property is on the edge of the strip and has little to offer of interest if you want to wander around because the pool closes at 7 pm. 7. The managers bury their head in the sand - and I was lied to and treated like an imbecile - even though I've stayed in hundreds of hotels for thousands of room nights over the last 10 years. 8. I was provided a complimentary meal voucher to make up for our troubles, but it wasn't worth the hassle to receive. 9. Internet was unreasonably expensive; wireless was slow. 10. Do not stay stay four to a room! Rooms with 2 queens are only large enough for 2 people - 1 per bed. If you have children you will go out of your mind - not enough closet space to put the clothes and we had to live out of our suitcase. 11. Pillows about as thin as a pancake. I'll never stay at this disaster of a place again. If you enjoy camping and roughing it - this is definitely the place for you. If you enjoy quality and service then move on and stay elsewhere."

    "content": "Stayed for the first time at the Mandalay Bay Hotel for two nights with my 10 year old daughter. We had a strip view room on the 29th Floor - and, wow, a great view looking up the Strip day and night. Was impressed with the hotel overall. It is one of the more upmarket ones but is not pretentious (say compared to the Bellagio). It's family friendly and laid back but classy. Found all the staff from the porters and bell boys, reception,etc, friendly and helpful. The casino is well lit rather than the dark mazes found in some other Vegas hotels. We had a hire car with Dollar and dropped the keys off at the hotel no problem, the Dollar desk being inside very near the main entrance. We treated ourselves to a cabana for a day of chilling at the pool - booked in advance from the UK. Had one on the island in the lazy river - from what I could see, these looked to be the most private in the pool complex as no loungers are able to get up close compared to those on the beach area. The pools are great - lots of lifeguards, we enjoyed the wave pool and the lazy river. The cabana is well worth it if you can afford to splash out! It's mostly families and couples using the pools. The lazy river wasn't overcrowded and is very child friendly. There is a free monorail from the hotel up to the Luxor and the Excalibur hotels. Check in/check out was no problem. Would stay here again. Perhaps the only downside is that it is at the bottom of the Strip if you want to go exploring other hotels and see other sights."

The bed seemed clean, but the sheets smelled like bleach. And don't get me started on the towels. They were dingy and also smelled of bleach. The hand towels had a maple syrup smell. My tv was finicky, but worked for the most part. The only good thing is the strip view. My room was right outside the big marquee and I loved falling asleep to the constant flashing. Room service was repsonsive. Can't say my room was ever vacuumed. I came home with some hairs on my shoes that i never wore outside the room. If I have to go back to Vegas for business (or even for pleasure) i would not stay here. I had a much better experience at the Rio."

We have been to Las Vegas various times but had not stayed at Mandalay before, but we knew the grounds and pools were great so we gave it a try. Our room was nice with a view of the pools and the hotel lived up to our expectations; it was lovely inside and out and the service was friendly. The outdoor pool area is very large with several pools, wave pool with beach, and a lazy river. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained but if you are hoping for a relaxing day there in the company of other couples, think again. There were so many rowdy children and young teens that it was hard to enjoy the area. It seemed as though the parents had dropped their kids off and then went elsewhere and this made for chaos. There was no floating down the lazy river in peace because kids were jumping in practically on top of you, even though jumping was not allowed and the place was so crowded it was hard to even find a chair. There is an adults only pool but even there parents were bringing their kids in and I never noticed any of the staff enforcing the adults only policy. I was surprised that Las Vegas attracts so many children, I think of it as an adult playground. Overall, I think Mandalay Bay is a great hotel and would stay again but NEVER in the summer when the kids are out of school."

The only thing that marred the whole visit was that I was supposed to have gotten a room that faced the strip and we got one that looked at the hotel when we checked in the desk clerk said to call the next day to arrange a move. When I called, the new desk clerk said I should be glad to have what I have since I got it through Travelocity. The waiters, waitresses, cleaning crew were the most helpful and friendly. At 3am I ask the desk clerk where I could get coffee, she didn't know. I asked one of the guys vaccuming and he told me. Don't know if it was my race or pocketbook that warranted the treatment from desk clerks."

    "content": "Recently returned from a 4 day/3 night stay at Mandalay Bay. Overall the hotel is pretty nice. We asked for a srip view room and were not dissapointed at all. This is probably the best strip view I have sceen from a room in Vegas! Looked really great at night with all the lights! Our room was nice, comfortable and clean. The only problem is when we first checked into the room we did not have a full set of towels, we phoned the desk and were told they would send some up but that did not happen. The next morning after making due with what we had I spoke to a maid in the hall and asked her about it and it was corrected right away. Our check in was ok. The guy checking us in had some computer and printer problems which delayed the check in time, but he was very appologetic and gave us some additional comp tickets for free drinks, breakfast and concert tickets. We were there with 3 other couples and rented a cabana for the day. I have to say that for as much as you here about how great there pool is I was a bit dissapointed. Our cabana was not very nice, the cushions on the couch were dirty and ripped, no misters around the pool area at all to keep you cooler. The service was poor, we often had to go track down someone to bring us drinks etc. We have rented cabana's at other hotels in Vegas and thought they were sooo much better, MUCH better service elsewhere and we would receive other things like a round of free drinks or a platter of fruit etc but not at Mandalay Bay. We ate breakfast at couple different places in the hotel all were fine for breakfast. Had dinner one night at Stripsteak which was good, no complaints but not sure I'd go out of my way to go there either. Speaking of Out Of The Way....that is my biggest problem with Mandalay Bay is that it is at the VERY end of the strip. A bit too far to walk to the main part of the strip. Cabs will cost you $12-$15 one way to the heart of the strip. I probably would not make this a go to place to stay while in Vegas for that reason alone, too far down the strip."

Pools are great, not too crowded, but fun atmosphere, easy to get drinks, the other guests were great and easy to talk to, concert on the beach, Jimmy Cliff! was the best! Terrific venue for a show! Do NOT plan on checking in early, just know your room will be ready at 3pm, and leave your bags at the bell desk and they'll bring them for you when youre in your room~ check out via video from your room is well worth it! you can get itemized bill on your tv- Shark reef aquarium is also worth while~ i liked it!

    "content": "Spent a week with our 9 and 12 year old kids and we can't wait to go back again. Arrived at 3:00pm on a Saturday and check-in took only a few minutes. Asked for extra pillows which came in 15 minutes. Asked the hotel to change-out the A/C filter to help cool the room better-took 10 minutes. Check-out was a little longer on the following Saturday but that was because the computer went down for a few minutes and lovely Michelle at the desk was apologetic and graceful about it. The entire staff was excellent, polite and accommodating. Our room was clean and very, very spacious and the layout was good for a family of four to feel comfortable. We were on the 32nd floor overlooking the airport which the kids thought was cool since they could watch planes taking off and landing. Huge flat screen TV in our room excellent with over 100 channels. Flat screen TV in the bathroom was a big hit as everyone wanted a chance to take a bath in the large soaking tub and watch TV. Large glassed-in shower, separate toilet room and ample counters appointed in marble was lovely. The downside is that we couldn't really use the mini-bar to store drinks since it uses a magnet system to charge inventory. Move a drink off the magnet and you are charged whether you drink it or not. By far the best aspect of the hotel was its breathability for my kids. There is no getting around smoking in Vegas and having visited a number of casino hotels while we were there, I was impressed that Mandalay managed to keep the public areas better ventilated than most. The grounds, the facilities and the public areas were beautiful and well managed. All buildings were light and airy unlike many large casinos we visited that were surprisingly dark, cramped and smokey inside. The eateries on the main casino floor are excellent but for the high brow with the exception of Raffles and the buffet. The lower level by the pool offer pizza and sandwiches. The causeway that connects the hotel to the Luxor also offers a burger bar and a few other lower priced but obscure options. The three meal deal for the buffet is a cost saver for a family and the buffet is good. Having eaten buffets at Circus Circus (absolutely horrible!-no selection, poor quality), Rio Suites Carnival (Much selection, mediocre quality), the Mandalay buffet was a better value (Smaller selection than Rio but higher quality). A few tips that might help people who have not been here before. 1. This is a RESORT. They charge resort prices for water ($4), shade umbrellas ($75) premium beach seating ($50), drinks ($11) and food like any other resort I have stayed. While the property is on the far south side of the strip, this is actually a good thing for families. You are away from the seedier sections of North LV and the masses of people that flood the sidewalk and walkways in the center strip. You are also 10 minutes by car to a Target close to UNLV where you can stock-up on water and snacks. I would recommend buying a pool tube at a CVS or Walgreens close to UNLV. The resort will ask $16 for a small inner tube and almost $4 for a bottle of water. I bought one at CVS for $4 on the advice of one of the pool attendants. 2. The place is massive. It takes a while to walk from point A to point B. You also really need to plan on a long wait for elevators. You can anticipate when the lines will be the longest by taking into account large events such as concerts, boxing matches and convention events. Avoid the long line after pool closure by going up a flight of stairs to to the casino level and catch the lift there. 3.) Las Vegas is hot in the summer. The sand on the beach pool will blister feet. Water shoes work best since there's really no place to leave your sandals by the wave pool. We went to the beach almost every morning at 10:30 am and 4:00pm and did not have a problem finding a free lounge chair. The easiest place to grab one is right next to the pool snack shake to the left facing the wave pool. Shadier places can be found around the lazy river and East lagoon pool. The wave pool is a blast for kids and well monitored by life guards. I couldn't feel the heat in the water but I'm glad I bought spf 100 sunblock at Target. If you really want a Cabana, don't wait to reserve one. The cheaper ones get snapped up fast. I wished I had reserved one when we booked. 4. Rental cars are pretty cheap on average in Vegas. There is no charge for valet parking at the hotel and they will park your car even if the \"valet full\" sign is on. A car also allowed us greater freedom to eat off property. We're from the East so Del Taco and In and Out Burger were a big hit with the kids and helped stretch our food dollars. Taking the highway or back streets helped us get back and forth to other strip properties with less traffic. 5. Avoid Freemont Street especially at night if you have kids unless you want them to learn about drugs and prostitution. 6. If you're going to gamble, get a players club card on the casino floor. It's good for all slots in Mandalay and MGM held properties. My meager points earned me $40.00 off the bill which made the resort fee less costly. Remember to show your card at check-out and ask what you've earned. 7. Check online for discounts to attractions. I didn't pay full price for anything. Sometimes the discounts are noted on the hotel websites or just on the web. I signed-up for marketing emails from the casino's advocated by other reviews but they simply advertise room rates. While you may pay for wi-fi at Mandalay, direct connection via the modem is free. Bring a netbook or laptap if you need internet access since there is no traditional business class computers for you. 8. If you think you're a hipster, you won't like the pool. It's full of kids and families like ourselves. They will charge you for an adult only pool that is private. My only real complaint about the property is that the pool closes at 7:00pm. Yeah, I know all casino pools close at this time to promote gambling. But, a resort that caters to families may find it more advantageous to let the kids swim an extra hour to tire out and let mom or dad go gamble with less resistance. Having visited eight other hotel properties, we were very happy in our choice of Mandalay Bay."

It was blistering hot and if you did not book a cabana or one of the few sheltered seats it was way to hot to stay any length of time. If you want to sunbathe, that's great - but not otherwise. The wave pool was a blast and there were lifeguards everywhere. The lazy river was fun too. Its very far down at one end of the strip so not really well located but a nice hotel."

    "content": "General Spent 3 nights here in early August for a conference. Like many other resorts in Las Vegas, this hotel was humongous. It was located on the southern part of the Strip. From the hotel room to the conference center (at the hotel) actually took up to 10 minutes to walk there. Fortunately everything was all indoors since temperature outside was between 100-105. Check in was fairly quick. Staff was friendly. Resort Amenities There were several pools (including a wave pool). Since I was on business, I did not get a chance to use it. But looked quite crowded in the middle of the day. There was also an exercise area. Both of these were included within the \u201cresort fee\u201d (fortunately the conference sponsor paid). Plus the exercise area of the spa is an additional cost. There were many places to eat within the Mandalay complex, from a deli to VERY expensive restaurants. Like all other hotels in Vegas, the casino was very prominent and smoky. Accommodation My room had 2 queen size beds. Furniture and d\u00e9cor were both nice. It was a large room. Bed was a bit too soft. Pillows were uncomfortable. Everything was clean and in working order. There was a mini-bar that had \u201csensors\u201d so one may be charged for opening the refrigerator! No in-room coffee or couch/chair to sit on. The flat panel HDTV was also quite large (my estimate was 42\u201d). There was even a small TV in the bathroom. Internet access is included in the \u201cresort fee\u201d\u2014the service was reliable and speed was good. There was a safe in the room but nowhere near big enough for a laptop. My room faced the airport so the noise was noticeable at times. The bathroom was quite large, with a toilet room, glass shower, and tub. The bathroom drain gurgled at time, so can be annoying in the middle of the night. Summary Like all things Vegas, the entire resort is way over-the-top. My main complaint was the bed and pillows were not very comfortable. Otherwise everything else was good."

If you're going to Vegas to gamble + drink and don't want to waste time perusing up and down the strip, I would just stay at Mandalay Bay.

I traveled with 3 children and my Mom for a kids weekend in Vegas. Mandalay Bay was the perfect spot to see Lion King, visit the aquarium (my son says THE BEST in the world, and he's seem many!) and to go in the wave pool. It was a good destination stay. Be prepared for crowds (!) in the hotel and pool on the weekends - lift lobbies are full, elevators can take a long time, wave pool and lazy river are extremely crowded and it can be difficult to find a lounger. The valet was a long wait on Friday afternoon, so we swung around to The Hotel/West Valet and walked to Mandalay Bay. On the upside, check-in was very efficient, check-out via the room TV was a breeze, and the wave pool surfing was a blast! Costs can be high once in the hotel. With kids, I wish I'd found the food court earlier (lower level) and brought along juice boxes, water and snacks for the room and inflatables for the pool! All in all, this is a very nice hotel in a good location with the ability to get to nearby resorts and the strip with ease via the Tram. I would stay again, provided I could book early, find that good deal and remind myself that the resort fee of $16.80 per night is an acceptable surcharge, only becuase it is probably done up and down the strip."

The rule against floats in the pool was seldom enforced and we were constantly splashed and run into by kids. We were looking for a weekend away from our kids and this just didn't fit what we were looking for. I am sure the kids had a good time though. While the room was clean, I had a big problem with the way the bed was made. I understand most hotels don't use fitted sheets, but the flat sheet they put on the bed was at least a foot too short for the mattress. So we had a foot of exposed mattress pad. I thought it was very tacky. The hallways and slot machines were not kept clean either. Silverware was dropped and left in the hall for over 24 hours, drink cups in the halls, and empty bottles and overflowing ashtrays seemed to be the norm on the slot machines. That said, the bed was extremely comfortable (until the unfitteed flat sheet was pulled out of place) and we had a nice, relaxing vacation. I loved the food there."

It was a gorgeous room and washroom - absolutely immaculate... however, we were told we would be getting a room with a view.. the \"view\" was a 4 foot x 3 foot window with bars accross it and was situated in a very awkward angle... no real view whatsoever.. if you really craned your neck and stuck your face right up against the wall you could comewhat make out the pool downstairs. The minibar had a sensor.. so the minute u took something out... even moved it slightly you got charged for it! Beware of this - it basically means, you cannot use the fridge to store any outside food in it either. We were charged a $15 resort fee as well.. whatever that was for... Wave Pool was nice... but very crowded. Almost impossible to get a seat there... it was filled with kids who would get pushed into you when the waves started rolling... quite annoying. we opted instead to go to the regular pool which was deserted and much more relaxing. The outdoor concert setting on the wave pool stage was nice too.. would have been nice to see a concert while we were there.. but unfortunately it was the Backstreet Boys who were playing that night!! This hotel is on the far south end of the strip - there is a shuttle that takes you from Mandalay to Luxor and Excalibur.. from there its a very quick walk over to New York New York and MGM Grand.. but you definitely would need to take a cab to get over to the other side. That being said cabs are quite reasonable - our max cab fare was about $15 --- the monorail one way ticket for one person is $5 .. so we found cabs to be much more convenient and cheap."

However, we couldn't find a single source(including the hotels own website) that would explain the various charges. Fine. We finally ask the front desk and they tell us it's $20/person....GREAT. We don't want to be bothered by kids and the top optional was important for my wife. Her bathing suit is hardly a couple of stamps and twine so the adult pool was our only choice. As we walk towards the pool, a nice gal gives us a few tickets to get in. *Awesome* Free for females and $15 for the guys(ok it's not fair but what the hell). Off we go through the gates and we are greated by a nice lady who tells us, \"those those tickets are for the bar only area.....\"WTF?????\" She further explains that the chairs by the pool are $60 each...each but that amount goes toward your drink purchases. Can anyone say, \"bait and switch?\" We would easily spend a few hundred dollars on drinks without being extorted. If all of this would have been up front and honest--fine. Intelligent people can make intelligent choices. But HIDING the fees is just wrong and then making seem as though its \"free\" for females and then later sticking them with this charge is even more frustrating. We told the manager about the situation and during her defending these nefarious practices she also tells us, \"it's no longer a european style pool.\" Double WTF???? Since every piece of literature they have explains that it is european sytle; had we gone in my wife would taken off her top only to be thoroughly embarrassed. We stopped spending our money at this hotel immediately. Told the three other couples we were with who were also staying at the Mandalay to not spend any money there. All told the hotel lost us as customers for life and upwards of $2000.00 in drinks and dinners alone--all for a $60 GOTCHA!"

    "content": "I stayed Fri-Tues with my mother and sister for my sister's 40th birthday. This was my first trip to Vegas, but I they had both been before - my mother many times. When they said we were staying at MB, I got on here and read the reviews. I was not impressed and so went into the trip a little nervous about what I'd find. I've stayed at many very nice hotels across the country and in Europe. This one was perfectly fine. Was the furniture a little scraped up? Yes. Was the pool crowded? DEFINITELY. Was there usually a wait for the elevator? Yes, albeit a short one. Did these things ruin my trip? Absolutely not. This is a BIG hotel and that means crowds and less personal service. Go into it expecting that, and you will be fine. Want all the bells and whistles and schmoozing? Stay somewhere else. ROOM - we stayed on the 30th floor w/a view of TheHotel (not the strip). We had two queen beds and one rollaway (at no charge, I might add). Being the youngest-non-birthday girl, I got the rollaway. It was quite comfortable, and the room was spacious enough to accomodate it no problem (see photo). The room was clean and ready upon our arrival (and prior to the normal check-in time). There was a short line at reception, but I didn't feel like we waited an unreasonable amount of time. The bathroom was clean (my mother said the extra deep tub was fabulous!) and stocked. The shower was AWESOME. We did have to call down for the rollaway and extra towels/pillows, and they were delivered promptly. After reading the complaints about the minibar, I checked ours when we got there and it was missing two items. We didn't mention it but were on the lookout for charges at check-out. There were none, so no problem there. As for noise, I was surprised at how much I could hear coming from the hallway. The slamming of doors was particularly annoying, as were the drunk revelers coming in at all hours. If you are a light sleeper (like me), plan on bringing ear plugs, a white noise machine, or 'medicinal help' to sleep through the night. Compared to the big resorts at some place like Disney, Disney does a MUCH better job at keeping noise transfer to a minimum. The a/c had trouble keeping up on the day we checked in, but we think it's b/c the maids open the drapes (duh?! ever heard of solar energy? it's the DESERT!) when they make up the room. We kept the do-not-disturb sign on our door the rest of the trip - and the drapes CLOSED - and didn't have a problem after that. LOCATION - yes MB is the last big resort on the strip, closest to the airport (see photo). We didn't find this to be a problem. We knew we'd be hitting the pavement a lot. You can take the free tram to the Luxor or Excalibur to save a few steps if you want. Cost of a cab back from the other end (near Bellagio/Wynn) was about $15 w/tip. Split amongst the 3 of us, no biggie. FOOD - we ate at the buffet restaurant for dinner and breakfast once each during our trip, and also at the Red, White & Blue place. Buffets were adequte - seafood, beef, pasta, salads, sides, breads, desserts. The usual. Definitely had better at the Bellagio. Food and service at the RW&B was very good. All other meals we ate off-site. Food is expensive and just okay, but for me it was comparable to Disney. You can't expect greatness when they are trying to feed the masses. Other than Starbucks, there weren't any chain/fast food type places here. I liked that aspect. And if that's what you want, hop on the free tram to Excalibur where they have nothing but. CASINO - we visited nearly every large casino in Vegas during our trip, and MB was one of the cleanest, largest, well-lit, and best at getting rid of the cigarette smoke. Drink service was a little slower during the day, and always better at the tables than at the slots, but still very friendly and accomodating (IMHO). POOL - didn't even try. Being there in late July, the sand/concrete was so unbearably hot, I don't know how people walked from the water to their seats w/o getting 3rd degree burns (see photo, doesn't do it justice). There is absolutely NO shade unless you are willing to shell out the bucks for a cabana. We did find an adult pool that was around back and up some stairs, but figured it wasn't worth the sunburn. We watched folks on the lazy river for a bit - it's more like a lazy stream. Very small, probably can't fit two tubes across, and very crowded. Nothing like the one at MGM (according to my mother). I definitely agree w/other reviewers on this: LOTS of kids at this hotel. Now that I've been there, I don't get the whole kids in Vegas thing, but to each his own. Overall, I would rank this hotel as more \"upper-middle class\" than luxury. It's head and shoulders above places like the Luxor and Excalibur (and I could tell that just from the lobby!), but not as upscale as the Wynn. But at $95/nt, that's perfectly fine to me."

The service is great, the rooms are large and clean, great comfy beds, the food is great, the pool is cool and the shark tank is great! I was so impressed with Mandalay Bay this time, they are on top of things. We were upgraded through our players club (get it, it's worth it), to a strip view room. I have quickly graduated to a casino host, didn't take much to do so. Great deals and service with casino host, mostly e-mails to call-in type of offers. It was my daughters birthday, there to see Lion King. I was impressed by a couple of things, one: 2 for 1 wine friday night at Raffels Cafe. Great Food! And a very ODD thing happend, someone on our floor went out and was sprayed by a skunk, it smelled terrrible. The Mandalay Bay staff was on top of it and removed the smell out of the hall and elevator in to time flat. I was impressed! The hallways were looking a little scraped up, scuff marks on the baseboards and doors, the Mandalay Bay staff was on it the \"eluminating engineers\" (maintaince staff) was on top of that too, Cleaning and touching up paint, with what appeared to be \"no smell\" paint. POOL: always great! Lazy River, Wave Pool, Regular Pool. Only issue is seating as usual. You have to claim a chair, unofficially placing your items on a chair. COMPLAINTS, small but valid: VALET AND POOL SEATS. The VALET: It was chaose. And with Chaose, people act stupid, we had people trying to cut us off with there large SUVs, I have one too, so there! We waited 20 minutes at one point and they were not taking not of who was there first. HIRE MORE VALETS, MANDALY! This is a common theme at all the hotels in Vegas, cutting valet service, wrong thing to do! POOL SEATS: It always seems to be a challenge to find a lounger right away. People leave there towles behind that are supplied by the hotel. It appears the seats are taken, when in reality the last person was too lazy to pick up there towels and through them in a used towel cart. I think a simple soulution would work, of a sign, or have the people at the entrance just mention to remove your towel when leaving."

They allowed early check in with no extra charge and the buffet there was decent for the money. The bathroom was luxiourous with a TV, soaking tub, and separate shower. The pool area was total fun..with some problems. First of all, we were going as a family with 2 separate rooms. I requested adjoining rooms. However they gave us rooms 4 floors apart. When we went to the pool, you had gates to walk through like an amusement park, you had to have your key scanned, and you had to pick up and leave the towels at the pool area. Unless you get there when the pool area opens, it is very difficult to find a seat. We tried to put our towels and shoes on the ground, but were told by some staff members that you couldn't do that. I think it is mainly because they have so many people that they are overwhelmed. Someone almost started a fight because they were afraid that we were going to take their chair. Also the cost of inner tubes is $25 so bring your own or buy one at the ABC store down the street. But overall, it is a beautiful hotel. Just wish that they could iron out these kinks a bit."

The breakfast buffet at Bayside Buffet was pretty standard, but not expensive, so okay. The dinner at Aureole was wonderful! It was very easy to make a reservation there through the room phone. Cons: SO MANY PEOPLE. And a lot of children. It seemed like we were always waiting for the elevator. Check in was a bit overwhelming--the lines! They charge $15 for use of internet and fitness center, which didn't seem to be optional. The internet connection was pretty erratic and we didn't use the gym. It's at the very end of the strip, but at least there's a (free!) tram from Mandalay to Luxor to Excalibur. That helped a little--we could make it to the Bellagio without getting totally exhausted! Altogether, it was a good stay. A very pretty, very clean, and very big hotel. I think it's size and popularity gets in the way of a really great experience for individual guests.

    "content": "This was our 8th trip to Vegas over the last 18 years. We enjoy visiting in the summer when we can spend our days relaxing at the pool so we normally choose our accommodations based on pool amenities and location. In the past we've stayed at the Mirage, MGM, or Rio Suites. Mandalay is our favorite so far! The main thing that set this apart from the other hotels mentioned was that you did not have to walk through the casino to get to the pool! The main elevators take you directly to the pool level! I spend plenty of time in the casino, but don't want to have to walk through one in my swimsuit! Once on the pool level, you have 4 pools (including a wave pool) plus a lazy river to choose from. Since we were there over the 4th of July weekend, all pools were packed, but Mandalay opened up an additional pool, the South Lagoon Pool for the over-flow. There are quite a few families at this hotel and the wave pool is popular with the kids. The drink service was pretty good around the pool and an ice tea was reasonable at $4. There are also ample shade trees around all the pools (not as much at the South Lagoon) when you've had enough sun. Beyond the pool, the rooms were up-scale, clean and comfortable. However, we did feel that the walls seemed thinner than other hotels we've stayed at as we could hear our neighbor's conversations at 3 am. Please also be aware that this hotel is at the very south end of the Strip, so if you are a first-timer wanting to see all the attractions, bring along your best walking shoes! If you choose to, you can walk through several hotels, staying out of the hot sun on your journey up the Strip. Overall, we REALLY enjoyed this hotel and are considering returning next summer with our kids and several other families."

The sand was too hot to walk on without shoes and my shoes were too hot to put on unless I remembered to keep them in the shade under my chaise. I would regularly do laps in the lazy river to keep cool. Our room was quite nice with a view of all the pools (seven, I counted), the airport, and Black Mountain in the background. As with other trips to Las Vegas, check in took too long, but there were no problems with our room at all. My biggest disappointment with the hotel is the restaurant choices. There was really no restaurant appealing to all of us. We attended the Lion King one night, so took dinner at The Raffles restaurant which had terrible service--highly unusual for Vegas. We had breakfast at the House of Blues which was good, but very expensive. I might stay again for the right deal, but would look for other hotels first."

It was hard to get a meal for less than a hundred bucks (2 people) in the hotel. We ate many meals \"out\" or carried in from elsewhere. The wave pool was awesome, but it was a little ridiculous that you needed to pay almost $20.00 for your own tube to go in the lazy river! Lots of amenities if you have the money to afford them. Not the place to go on a tight budget b/c you will leave disappointed."

First, the rooms.....stayed in the standard room with 2 queen beds and the view was decent (looking out at the Luxor, In/Out Burger, Excalibur, etc.). Beds were comfortable, bathroom was huge, but the remote for the TV wouldn't work for anything. Guest services brought a new one up, but still we got nothing. Plus our iron leaked water and didn't work. The second one they brought up worked fine. Elevators were quick and we never had to wait. The casino? Along with Mirage, Mandalay Bay is the best smelling casino in Vegas. It's worth the stay to walk through the casino every morning and smell tropical/vanilla/coconut aroma. Another thing I like about the casino is that there are high ceilings and it is spacious so you can walk around easily-even if it is packed. The pool? Spectacular in a nutshell. Despite being crowded, it is still worth the trip out there. You can always find a seat somewhere if you look hard enough. Food? Ate at the Rumjungle (was expecting the worse and it was actually quite good) and also ate breakfast at House of Blues (excellent). Location? It's tucked away from the action, but you can always hop on the tram and take it to Luxor or Excalibur. For the most part, Mandalay Bay is good enough to where you really don't need to leave for a day or so. Would stay here again."

As an adult I didn't think there would be much to do in Vegas with a kid, but this hotel might of been the highlight of our 2 week travel through Northern and Western U.S.A The room was extremely large, and the bathroom had a separate toilet room, standing shower and bathtub. We had an excellent view of the pools, which we preferred, as Mandalay is at the end of the strip so there wasn't much of a view on the other side of the hotel anyhow. The pools were amazing! We never had any trouble finding deck loungers, and we offered drinks by the waitresses many times. My son loved the wave pool, and we loved because tubes weren't allowed in it! All the kids in the pool were at least 9 and older as there is height requirement to be in the wave pool of 48 inches. The tube rental for the lazy river was quite expensive, but it looked like people had found a place to purchase cheaper tubes and they were allowed in the pool area. We never bothered with the tubes. We used the tram to get to the Excaliber Hotel and then walked the strip. There is another tram at the Bellagio that can get you back towards the Aria Hotel which makes your walk back a little easier. Just make sure to check what time the trams stop, as we missed it one night and it was a long walk back! On the Beach level floor of the Mandalay is a cafeteria that has cheaper food and a whole pizza for $14. We loved our stay here and will recommend this hotel to friends going to Vegas with kids."

Not to mention you can \"RENT\" a chair for $50 that is saved for you all day and then you don't have to get up early. I can go to ANY other hotel on the strip and get a FREE chair and not get up that early. The food although good - the service was slow. The employess are extremely RUDE at the restaurants and the valet guy was even more rude then the restaurant. We could never valet the car because the valet was ALWAYS FULL . Even on during the week.

Did one of the strip view rooms, 25th floor, for about $100/night. We drove 5 hrs in the desert heat, couldn't find where to self park and register, and after a view tense moments in the car, decided to pull back around and valet. Waited 10 minutes, couldn't find anyone to ask, I bailed out of the car to beg for help. Good thing this was 'free' because I was exhausted. We got inside to Registration, found long lines across the board. While checking in, the attendant made no mention of how the actual mini-bar worked, just to 'be careful'. Our room was clean, linens un-stained, bed comfy, bathroom clean but the furniture was chipped, stained and generally very old. The mini-bar contained four empty bottles of Grey Goose & Absolute. We called down to advise them that we didn't drink the liquor and that they needed to be replaced (they never sent anyone up to do this), so we sat them on top of the dresser and then moved out some of their water to replace it with our own (BTW-I never heard about free water!!!!!). On the 2nd day, I called down to follow up on the liquor and was told I was being charged for everything NOT in the minibar. Ugh. The pool..... We went to Moorea the first day to check it out - all full, no cover charge, but full. We popped over to the casino - CLOSED except for Fri-Sat-Sun. We were very disappointed because the website does not disclose this. The next morning we went to the wave pool at 9:30 - no seats. Kids everywhere...shouldn't they be in Disneyland, and not Vegas? Floaties and innertubes as far as the eye could see. We went to the adult pool, which didn't open until 11am (although it opened late both days). Got in (no cover), found two lovely chairs, and enjoyed the day. Next day, we were asked to pay a cover, I questioned this and was promptly told off by some 22 year old male that thinks he's some hot nightclub bouncer. Are you kidding me? Those in line behind us were embarrassed for us and for him and also complained to the manager (who never came back after taking our 'statement'). The restaurants were good and had pleasant staff - but the hotel takes itself way too seriously. It's not the happening place it wants to think it is. It's a place where you'll pay $18 for pancakes, $20 for a drink that's mis-advertised, pay $50 to get into a pool that says nothing about a cover on the website, and wait six or seven times for an elevator. It took us 50 minutes to check out and get our car from the valet (we were third in line for checkout and first in line for valet). We tried to make the best of it, and really it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. We won't be back."

The pool area was full before 9am if you wanted a bed you needed to be there at 7.45am to queue up - luckily we are early risers. If you have kids it's perfect the wave pool is so much fun but if you are a couple wanting a quiet break it's not for you. It took us 4 goes to get a lift (elavator) on our checkout day. There are only 6 of them and they get VERY busy and are always full. On a positive note the room next to us were having a party in the early hours and we told the front desk as you could hear their music on the whole floor. 2 mins later security were on the floor and told them to stop. Next door then stole our do not disturb sign but it was replaced by the hotel very quickly. It does take a while to get to the main strip but if you don't mind walking it's really not that far - especially with trams and the monorail. In summary very nice hotel, beach area is nice when it's quiet, it's quite far from the rest of the strip but fine if you like walking and don't go on the 4th July weekend unless you don't mind waiting 20 mins for an elavator and big crowds."

The upside to this hotel IMO are the wide variety of restaurant choices, many of which are excellent (Border Grill, Strip Steak). Additionally, both the Mix Lounge and Foundation Room offer one of the best views of the strip and are a great place to relaz with a drink. What really got me this time was the cocktail service at the tables. Or maybe I should say the lack thereof. Stayed there last year and had no issues with getting drinks while playing (blackjack). This year, it was virtually impossible to get a drink. No kidding, I played blackjack there for 3 days, several hours at a time, and got maybe 2 drinks. Once, the girl took my order and never returned! Mentioned it at checkout and the guy told me that was one of their biggest complaints. Played at a bunch of other MGM properties while there and got plenty of drinks, but MB was practically dry lol. Im far less enamored with their pool, as well. The wave pool is frankly a zoo - no seats available and hundreds of screaming kids. My wife and I are late 30s and its not even an option for us. We just pay the fee to go to Moorea, which is fun, but you almost feel forced into doing it if you want any kind of pool experience. Dont want to sound too negative as, like I mentioned earlier, there are some real posiitives to MB. Id probably still recommend it to a friend (with caveats), but with all the options in LV now, I just think theres some better choices at this price point."

Downsides are that it is on the very end of the strip, so getting to other hotels for shows or restaurants is quite the haul or taxi ride (about $11 to get to half way up the strip via taxi). It could be cleaner. A few of our towels were dirty and our sheets had stains on them. But cleaner than what I expected for a Las Vegas hotel. Plus the walls and doors are thin... we could hear our neighbors open and close doors and talk... It sounded like they were in the room with us. We tried to go to the pool... This is where all of the orange beauties with their 6 kids like to take over. There was no open chairs and we had to walk around a while before we found an open corner side of one of the pools. Great place if you are a family wanting some beach fun, but a nightmare if you are a couple looking for a relaxing time by the pool. The casino is laid out nicely and not crowded like others on the strip. It is well lighted and easy to get around. There are many good restaurants and shopping that is included in the hotel. The room service is very tasty! After walking around the other hotels on the strip, Mandalay Bay is one of the best choices on the strip, but be ready for kids and having to walk a lot or taking a taxi everywhere."

    "content": "This is my fourth time staying at Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino. I love the rooms. Everything looks new and the beds are super comfy. Staff is also super friendly!! Lasts weeks stay I received a Double twin on the 27th floor. I don\u2019t think the Double twins are as popular. The beds worked fine since I was traveling alone. Cloths go on one bed and I sleep in the other. But at Mandalay bay the King bed comes with an awesome sofa. This is nice at night if you have a room on the higher floors. Request a view overlooking the stripped. From my window I could see the entire Las Vegas strip. Sofa would have been really nice. Recommend staying away from the lower levels. They lights beaming up at the hotel will keep you awake. I had this problem last year. Beware the elevators are busy. You might have to wait a few minutes. Floors 19 and up use separate elevates. I was also impressed with the Internet speed in the room. Speed worked perfect for Skype Video calls. Never used the mini bar or ordered room service. The mini bar is magnetic so if you touch something you could be charged. As a hotel resident you can invite three guests to the pool. The gentleman said four people per room key. Wave pool is great. It sucks that Mandalay Bay has taken away some beach area to create elite seating. So beach chairs can be really hard to find. I never saw anybody collecting the towels that people left behind. You have no idea if people have left. I would definitely stay here again."

While I give this hotel a high rating and would certainly stay there again, it was the 1st time I saw a couple of \"seams.\" I hope it isn't a sign that the commitment to excellence, a maintenance schedule, is being overlooked? As an example, there was a small tear in the carpet in the 34th floor by the elevator bank. I love Shanghai Lily's restaurant. The Red,White & Blue for breakfast is adequate but I didn't care for the breakfast in the Buffet restaurant. You can't comment on the Mandalay Bay without mentioning the great pool experience. A tip of the hat to the entire staff at the pool bar as they are always friendly, cover a huge area with hundreds of customers. I enjoy staying at the Mandalay as I frequently travel on business and I can always rely on a terrific experience here. GREAT convention site. I do hope that this hotel will be a top echelon Vegas hotel for years to come."

    "content": "This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The Mandalay does not have any \"gimmicks\" such as a Venetian canal or Roman streets, but makes up for it with style and class (a rarity in Vegas). The rooms are great, even the \"basic\" room we had was large, with big beds and a big flatscreen tv in the living room and another tv in the bathroom. You are helped promptly on arrival, though the check-in desks are slightly hard to find if you park your own car and have to walk from self-parking to the front desks. (you have to go through the casino, which are purposefully designed to keep you \"trapped\" looking for the exit) This was my second time in Vegas, and the first time at the Mandalay. The hotel is located at the end of the strip, but that is probably a good thing as it does not get so many people wandering in. Also has a fantastic \"beach\" area with a number of swimming pools. Get there early and you are probably able to find a nice spot in the shade (note: Vegas gets very hot very quick!). Alternatively rent one of the plush cabana's, but plan in advance because the cabana's will go quick when it's busy, with the least expensive ones going first. (cheapest was about $200 I believe) One of the other reasons to visit Mandalay, even if you don't sleep there, are the amazing restaurants. I had one of the best meals ever in Vegas eating at the Mandalay. First night we dined at the Stripsteak, which has fabulous food complemented with a first class service. Second night we had dinner at Lupo's, which serves fantastic Italian food. Both restaurants are not cheap, but so worth it. If you don't want to spend so much on food, go for the Raffles cafe, a buffet style restaurant. It is open 24 hours and I would recommend this for breakfast. For about $22 you can go crazy and there is more food then you will ever eat, from simple bacon and sausages to lobster. Great place to stay and I would definitely come back here."

    "content": "Hotel: My room was on the 18th floor overlooking the strip/airport. I never really noticed any airport noise like other people have talked about. At noon the hotel started taking early registration and they had a room ready for me. It was nice being able to check in a few hours early. There was no charge for this, so if you get there early see if you can check in. If a room isn\u2019t ready they will hold your bags for you. The d\u00e9cor is a bit dated but who really cares, it\u2019s a hotel room, not your house. Everything was clean, no spots on the carpet, no mold in the bathroom, it smelled clean, and everything was in working order. The bed is way to soft for my liking and the air conditioner did not get the room very cold. My big complaint is the shower water temperature. I had the water temp set perfect and then it would fluctuate. It was perfect, then hot, perfect, cold, hot, you get the picture. It wasn\u2019t exactly pleasant. Beach/Pool: The Beach is not as crowded during the week as it is the weekend. The pool opened at 8am when a line forming around 7:45. If at all possible, get there early to get a lounge chair along the front row of the beach. The sand at the beach gets incredibly hot and it burns the bottom of your feet. We are talking serious pain here! Also, make sure your towel covers all metal parts on the lounge chair because it too gets insanely hot. I actually burnt the tops of my feet on the metal frame when was lying on my stomach. I had blisters on the top of my feet. Ouch! I found the beach to be more relaxing than the other pools. For one, the wave pool water is actually cooler than the pools and secondly, there is a height requirement of 48\u201d so most of the smaller kids are not in the area. The lazy river is a waste of time. The water moves too fast, there are too many people in floating rings and too many kids swimming around not paying attention to where they are going. If you do venture to the lazy river buy your own floating ring from Target and save yourself some $$. Food: Red, White and Blue is a great place to pick up a sandwich to go. The to go menus is a few dollars cheaper than eating in. They also have a really good breakfast croissant sandwich with ham, cheddar, and egg on it. The Starbucks by StripSteak is very good, yes it\u2019s more expensive than regular Starbucks, but they had fast service and their Chai Tea was excellent. For most of my meals I ventured up the strip to the Town Square. It\u2019s a great outdoor shopping area with lots of food options. I went to The Yard House, California Pizza Kitchen, Anthony\u2019s Coal Fire Pizza, and Yogurtland. I also went to the Green Valley Ranch area to visit Lucille\u2019s BBQ which was the best bbq I have ever had. It\u2019s worth the drive. Aquarium: Not worth the money! I stopped at every exhibit, took pictures, and read all the descriptions and was in and out in about 20 minutes. It\u2019s not as big as they make it out to be. I found the aquarium in the lobby to be much more exciting than the actual Shark Reef aquarium."

I booked air/hotel package through a well known canadian airlines. At check -in we were advised that our reservation could not be located and we had to put the 1.night on our credit card until everything was sorted out and someone from the hotel would call us the next day. Our room was on the 3rd floor \"overlooking\" the roof. The room itself was clean and very nice and so was the bathroom, however the king size bed mattress was horrible. It was impossible to sleep with 2 people so one of us slept on the floor for 4 nights! Yes, we did ask for a new room....no luck! The worst was the noise coming from the next room. The walls are very thin..we could hear EVERY word. That was going on all night! So after several trips to the front counter and 3 expired room keys...the finally located our reservation! The hotel itself is very nice, we did enjoy the pool area and no problems getting chairs. We also went to the Shark Reef which we enjoyed very much. We also got a bus pass for 3 days. We've been to Vegas many times and know how to get around with the buses and tram. So the location of the hotel and the end of the strip was not an issue for us. I rated the hotel overall poor, because without a good night sleep it doesn't matter how nice the rest of the hotel is!"

A little FYI\u2026 It\u2019s $25 to rent a PLASTIC tube for the lazy river\u2026. You cannot bring your own\u2026 You can buy one or rent one both outrageously priced. What this hotel lacks is customer service! From the moment we arrived the front desk staff (in particular \"Anna\") was not very welcoming. We arrived a few hours after check-in. We were told that our room was not ready and that we would have to wait 20-45 minutes for our room to be cleaned. She said there was a king room available right now. Please keep in mind there were four girls traveling together. One king beds not an option\u2026 So why ask! She offered us a $100.00 credit for the wait. We were happy that at least they offered to make it right\u2026 Thing only got worse. In the time that I booked the reservation to when we arrived they instituted a $15 \u201cResort Fee\u201d. This fee covered internet, the fitness center (that had two treadmills) and two bottles of water in your room. We were told this was optional mandatory. The rooms at this hotel are great! Large and very nicely decorated. It worked great for four ladies. However there were some areas that needed dusting and the windows had finger markings on them. We booked a Strip View room, when we got to our room we had a view of the pool area (great view but not what we paid for). We went back to the front desk and asked Anna to look at our reservation and double check our room type. She told us we had booked a Premium View room (she lied to our faces! This hotel does not even have this room type!) And not a strip view room. I was certain that I booked a 550 Strip view room. I asked her to make sure to look at the reservation again. In an effort to attempt to confuse us, she tried to use her \u201chotel math\u201d to make use think we were getting a great deal. At this point we walk away from the front desk. I know what I booked, my mistake was not printing my confirmation (which I advise you to do if you book this hotel). I went back to my phone and use it to try to pull up my email. My friend decided she could not be without internet in the room and went back to the desk to ask them to add on the Resort Fee. Anna tells her \u201cTell your friends that they were right\u201d. She told us they did not have any strip view rooms for that night. We ended up having to change rooms the next day which was a pain! She did give us a $50 back because our pool view room was cheaper than what we had paid for the Strip view. She did not even offer us anything for wasting over an hour of our time. What really got me was the way she insisted we were wrong and then took it all back minutes later! She makes a mistake and doesn\u2019t even attempt an apology."

    "content": "We are Las vegas residents and have taken several in-town getaways at local resorts. I've always liked the Mandalay Bay property, but we'd never stayed there. For Father's Day, I booked a massage for my husband and thought it would be fun for us to stay overnight with our small son and enjoy a weekend. It turned out to be much less fun than I'd hoped, and it was a terrible value for the money I paid. There are still good things about the resort, but our experience was sub-par for what I expect from a property like this. The Good: Shark Reef was having its 10th anniversary and tickets were discounted. This is an amazing attraction, and a great place to take the kids. Because of the discount, the line was 40 minutes long, but my 4-1/2 year old begged to stay, and bless his heart, he was so good in that long line. To the resort's credit, they had a strolling magician and Sharkey the mascot entertaining those of us waiting. My son was chosen by said magician to help with a simple trick and he was thrilled. Also nice, there were ocean-themed cakes made by all the sister properties to look at and vote for, and balloon artists and face painting, all free. Long lines again, but my little guy was happy to wait another 45 minutes to get his balloon octopus. If they'd had a couple more people to help out it would have been so much faster, but for free extras, I'm not complaining that loudly. The property itself is lovely. The room we stayed in was beautiful and clean. I paid for a strip view and got it in spades - on the 23rd floor. Just breathtaking. Spa Mandalay is exquisitely appointed. There are literally dozens of restaurants and bars and places to eat. There is a food court located near Shark Reef, and a coffee place, The Orchid Lounge, just outside the hotel elevators for quick morning pick-ups and pastries, etc. We loved The Border Grill for a late lunch; best service in the resort, hands down. The Bad: The place is a mega-resort, and as such, expect crowds, lines, and delays for even basic services. It was typical to have to wait up to ten minutes to get an elevator up or down during the day, as several might stop that were too crowded for even just my son and I to fit on. Checking out? Be prepared to wait 20 minutes for a bellman, 20 minutes for your car at valet, and 10-15 minutes for your bags. Want some coffee? Get up early, or you're in line another 20 minutes. The pool was so packed we only stayed an hour, and it was just wall-to-wall bodies. Don't even try to get a beverage from a cocktail waitress there, unless you're willing to shell out $375+ for a cabana. We ate dinner at Rick Moonen's RM Seafood, and the food was pretty good, but the prices are astronomical and the service was adequate at best even though it was early in the evening and not crowded (a shock in itself). The crab cake appetizer was delicious, but at $17 for a single small cake, I was more annoyed than delighted. My pasta entree had some kind of odd \"lemon foam\" on it that looked so much like soap suds that it nearly ruined the dish for me. I know that sort of touch is among the latest fads in haute cuisine right now, but I think it's silly and affected. It adds nothing to the food. I waited and waited for a drink refill, another annoyance. The rooms have such poor air circulation that we cranked the thermostat down to 66 and were still overheated during the night. The air register is small for the room size and located in a corner, not in a central location. Also, each bed has only two tiny, lumpy, poky feather pillows for sleeping, and ONE extra in the closet. Asking for more pillows proved fruitless. Housekeeping never showed up, and we finally gave up. The Ugly: I booked a massage for my husband well in advance and received an e-mailed confirmation. While he was IN THE SPA waiting for his service, the manager came back and attempted to CANCEL his confirmed appointment, saying they had \"double booked\" their masseuse. Lucky for them, they did not reach me because I would have been very explicit in my displeasure. Coincidentally, a few minutes later, the manager did come back and tell my husband they could accommodate him - the manager ended up performing the service. This is fine, but Spa Mandalay and that manager should NEVER have bothered my husband with their staffing problems. Extremely unprofessional behavior, and they didn't offer him anything - no apologies, no extras, no discount, NOTHING for the inconvenience. We will NEVER go back there no matter how nice it looks. We have been to other amazing spas all over the U.S. and the Cayman Islands - this is not how a luxury spa operates. They fix any issues themselves and never bother the client with it. All in all, it is with regret that I cannot recommend the Mandalay Bay. If you're looking for a true luxury experience on the Strip, stick with the Four Seasons, which is right on Mandalay property. For a better price but still a very good experience, try the Venetian or the Palazzo. Off-Strip, I recommend the J.W. Marriott. DO head to the Mandalay Bay for Shark Reef, though. Weekday mornings are best to avoid lines."

Las Vegas is one of our favorite destinations and we have been there several times. This was our first time staying at Mandalay Bay and unfortunately, it will be our last. I was excited to be staying here. I have heard great things. The hotel is is beautiful and our room was very nice, clean and comfortable. It was the guests staying there that I didn\u2019t care for. Both my husband and I believe that your guests reflect the kind of business you run and we didn\u2019t like what we saw. It was like a zoo. I expect some people to behave inappropriately, after all this was Vegas, but was surprised to see how much of this behavior is actually tolerated by the hotel. Someone kept taking our \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign off our door and then we were robbed at the pool. While we were in the pool someone stole my backpack. In the backpack were our sunglasses, cell phones, $60 cash, our room key, a book and my brand new digital camera that I purchased just for this trip. I know the hotel is not responsible for lost and stolen items, especially those left unattended however, I just didn\u2019t expect something like this to happen at a supposedly \u201chigh-end\u201d hotel like Mandalay Bay. Lots of couples and families leave their stuff unattended while going in the pool. I see it all the time. Over the years we have been to countless hotels and beaches and never had a thing stolen. Even at the seediest of hotels we never had any problems. What I witnessed when I was there was a lax in security. Before entering the pool/beach there is a sign that simply stated that in order to enter that area each guest (excluding children under 12 or 14) needs to show their room key. That is not what I witnessed. I forgot my room key and they let me in with my husband. I would have been happy to go back to the room to get my key, but I was told that wasn\u2019t necessary. While waiting to get in to the beach area we saw a lot of people, especially teens to maybe early 20 somethings, gain access with only 1 room key. Some didn\u2019t even have a room key and claimed they left it with a friend or in their bag that was already on the beach. I am willing to bet that half of them weren\u2019t even staying at hotel. When we realized our stuff was stolen my husband contacted an employee on the beach and he called security. This employee was nice and tried to be helpful. He even stayed with me until security arrived, which took over 20 minutes. He had to call security several times to see if someone was on the way. The guy in security that arrived to take my incident report was less then helpful. He paid no attention to detail. Even though I clearly stated that my backpack was stolen he continued to refer to is as a \u201cpurse\u201d. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I had to repeat that it was not my purse that was stolen, but a backpack. There is a big difference. He seemed to be distracted and could care less. Before I left the beach he told me that there are security cameras all around and they might be able to see someone taking my \"purse\". He also insisted that I call the Risk Management department the next day. He told me the number several times although I kept telling him that I didn\u2019t have anything to write the number down with or on. I was just robbed! My stuff is gone. What was i going to write the number down with? Did he even offer me his pen and paper? Everything I had with me at the beach was now gone. I was upset and felt violated and he was so unhelpful and unsympathetic. The next day I found out that Risk Management was closed on the weekends and I wasted my time tracking down the number and calling. Why was I not surprised? Another problem we had was when we checked out. Since we had time before our pickup we decided to check out directly with the front desk. They tried to charge us a \u201cresort fee\u201d. My husband prepaid for the entire trip, including the hotel, through Travelocity. We were not aware of a resort fee. It was not in the Travelocity paperwork. It was explained to us that everyone is charged a resort fee for things like the \u201ccomplimentary\u201d (yes, this was the word that was used) water and free internet access. For starters, complimentary means free. Secondly, no one mentioned this charge when we checked in. If we would have known the 2 bottles of water in our room was \"complimentary\" we would have drank them instead of buying waters in the gift shop for $$$. If we would have known we had \"complimentary\" internet service we would have used that instead of paying $1 a minute at their business center to get online to locate information for our cell phone provider to suspend our service after our phones were stolen. According to Mandalay Bay's website the resort fee also includes 2 cocktail vouchers to be provided at check-in. That was not mentioned either. We also didn't get any vouchers. We did manage to get the resort fee dropped. We would have disputed the charges with the credit company anyway. Although I blame myself for being stupid enough to leave my bag unattended I felt that the hotel should have done something to make me feel better. Most hotels in Vegas will bend over backwards to make things right with an unhappy guest whether it was the guests fault or not, but not this hotel. I guess they do so much business that one lost customer wouldn't make a difference. What should have been a great weekend turned into a big disappointment. If we ever return to Las Vegas I seriously doubt that I will stay at Mandalay Bay or any of the MGM properties."

    "content": "I sure hope things have changed, but I suspect not reading other reviews. When you complete your stay here, you will receive an online survey to take, but if you have specific complaints, unlike other service industry corporations, don't expect anyone to care or call you back for more information to address your issues. The hotel is beautiful. I arrived early and my room wasn't ready, but a few hours later I had a room with the view of the strip on the 19th floor. The room was nice, very well kept, Maria did a great job of keeping the room up for me. I was able to book at a discount @ $147/night over a weekend for 5 days. The food was great every place I ate between the Mandalay and Luxor, no complaints there. Since I saved on the room I took that money to sink into spa services. Prior to arriving I called the hotel to specifically ask if there was a fee to use the gym to workout, I was told by the persons at the front desk there wasn't one (I had found out from a prior trip to another casino further south on the strip that working out came with a fee). I know now, but after checking in, I went down to the spa to book a massage the following day. That morning I went down two hours prior to go work out only to be told there was a $17 fee. I became upset, knowing that I called to check this prior. The young woman working at the counter looked up my reservation and informed me that I had to pay because I had not special as part of my booking. Again, I know this now, but I already had a massage booked that morning, the young woman should have seen that and told me since I already had a spa service I could check in, work out lounge before my massage I had booked. I had to go back upstairs to the main desk to complain. The first person basically told me I was out of luck they were not responsible for misinformation. I asked to speak to another manager who looked at my reservation, then came back and comped me for the use of the gym and spa for the remainder of my stay. Again, once I figured all this out (could have been solved by spa staff who knew their job and cared about it), and had my first massage, I actually booked more spa services (funny how that works). Their spa is fabulous, which is why I went every day and booked more services, but I did not bother with the staff at the desk unless to book or check in. I tried to request nothing more from the front desk the rest of my stay, but I booked one final massage at 10:30, realizing that my checkout on Monday was at 11:00. So, I called the front desk asking for a one hour later check out. The person was terse and short with me and told me no way would she grant it, they had thousands of new guests to check in and I needed to be out by 11:00. I'm normally a rule follower but couldn't understand that if I told her the reason why I wanted one more hour was so I could spend more money in their spa, this couldn't be worked out. When I got back to my room at 11:10, I was locked out. Called Security, they were great, showed ID, finished getting ready and packed up and I was out of the room by 11:35am. My maid wasn't even finished cleaning rooms on my floor and hadn't even gotten to my room! The line to check out was super long, so they would not have known I took 35 extra minutes, but from the terse tone of the person I spoke to earlier I thought I'd be charged for not checkin out by 11:00 am. I was not, the person checking me out was great. I put my bags up and explored Vegas one final day before a nighttime departure. Again, I was surprised MGM even bothered sending a survey, seems like they only want to take in the good reviews. I said great things about my room service, and the gentlemen who comped me and the person who checked me out. But it's sometimes the little things, like your staff knowing their job and informing guests what the benefits and rules are, or at least doing so once they check your information. If Vegas has a high unemployment rate, they would do well to fire some of their staff and hire people who want to do their job, learn it, and in turn bring in more money on the services side for this casino/hotel. I've been back to Vegas since, and as much as I love the hotel, I will not stay there again unless work requires I do so."

    "content": "I asked where to park while checking in, twice were sent to park \"past the limos.\" There was no parking past there, drove all over trying to find a place to stop to unload luggage. I finally jumped out to go in to register while the spouse was told he could temporarily park the car in front of the hotel as long as he stayed with the car. Although check-in was quick, it went downhill from there. The \"wet bar\" is to be avoided, snack items are outrageously priced, don't pick something up to look at it or you'll be charged! Rooms have NO soundproofing and people in the adjoining room sound like they are sitting right next to you talking. After two nights of sleeplessness because of the residents next door partying until 2-4 a.m., we requested a new room. Staff were very cool to our request, said there were no rooms available, they would call us if something came up. After waiting all day, we again went to the front desk and asked if we could move to another room. They begrudgingly moved us to the back side of the motel into a handicapped accessible room. There was no reduction of room rate (we paid for a view room at check-in). The first room had a pervading odor of skunk and the shower did not drain when used. The toilet also didn't flush properly. The jacuzzi tub had some sort of leak also. The second room's sink had a drain problem so that about 15 minutes after using it, it would begin to gurgle and pop intermittently. The bathroom also had a constant odor of raw sewage. All the restaurants were horribly expensive and the food was nothing impressive. We have much better meals at home in the local cafes...more food and much tastier. We never gambled while there, had such a rotten experience we weren't interested in giving them any more of our money. You are told at check-in that you have several coupons and features at no extra cost. The two-for breakfast was not good for weekend meals. And it says in the fine print you are charged a $15 per day resort fee for the \"free services\" you get (free high-speed internet, free admittance to the spa, free newspaper). Our resort fee on the bill was $16, we didn't have a computer to take advantage of the high-speed internet, we didn't get a paper, and the pool/spa was too crowded to be anything we cared to do. Because it is at the far end of the strip, getting downtown to other activities and shows is spendy. It is a $15 one-way cab ride, or you have to walk quite a ways to catch the monorail, a $5 one-way trip per person. They did not have a shuttle to the airport, either, even though it is right across from the motel. We had to pay for a cab for that, too. On our way to the airport we passed a Best Western motel that had free shuttle service and a free hot breakfast. Knowing what we know now, I'm sure that would have been a much better place to stay."

THey did close off the front entrance for a wedding in the middle of the week which was inconvenient for all other hotel guests. Came back to room one afternoon and maid was finishing service. Noticed the bottles of water in the sensor snack tray were gone. Called front desk to let them know, they took care of it with no problems. Overall, awesome hotel. super comfortable beds!!!

It was a 20 minute wait and then we were the last stop so it ended up taking 45 minutes to get to the hotel. A cab would have been $13 and 5 minutes! Check in went fine. Our room was beautiful. We had an incredible view of the strip from the 33rd floor. Huge bathroom, big TV and a spacious room for 2. The bed was so comfortable! We are not serious gamblers and were trying to do Vegas on a budget (haha funny right!?). We played the slots and video poker when we were in the hotel casino and not once were we offered a drink in the whole 5 days we were there. I didnt' even see one cocktail waitress in the area. NY NY and other casino's we visited are much more generous with the complementary beverages, even if you are not a high roller. The food at the hotel was great, but there was no really casual dining or fast food. We got the all day buffet pass one day for $40 each. It was really good and totally worth it if you are going to stay in the area all day. Other than that, you have to spend $$$ to eat there. There were times we wanted to grab a quick snack or lunch and had to journey half way down the strip to get it. And believe me - it was a JOURNEY! This hotel is close to nothing. There is a tram that will take you to the Luxor and then Excalibur, but it closes at 10:30pm. It was not easy to get around from Mandalay unless you get cabs, which add up quick. If you are going to rent a car do it ahead of time and not at the hotel. It was $105 a day for a midsize. If we had planned ahead on that we could have paid less than half that. At times it was nice to be set back a little from the crazy Vegas scene, but not convenient at all when you wanted to leave the hotel. The pool area was incredible, but busy. Claim a spot early! Beware of drink prices too - a margarita was $12 at the pool and a beer was $8. So basically - the hotel was very nice. Maybe too nice for us. Next time I will stay somewhere mid-strip and a little less fancy. This is not for casual people on a budget."

    "content": "I've been to Vegas several times and have always wanted to stay at Mandalay Bay because I've heard so many great things about the pool area. I decided to finally book a stay there a few weeks ago. Though the weather was a bit chilly the few days I was there, but I still decided to check out the pool scene. On the weekend days it was insanely packed. You couldn't even think about getting a lounge chair, unless I guess you get there early in the morning. On the weekdays it was MUCH easier to find a place to hang out there. I was definitely disappointed though. I'm the kind of person that likes to splurge, especially when I'm on vacation, but I refused to pay over $20 to buy a float for the lazy river. I guess I should have looked into that before I went and bought one before I got there. Oops. The hotel itself is very nice - Typical of what you would see at most higher-end casinos. However, the location is pretty crappy, though I knew this a long time ago. You can easily navigate your way to the Luxor, Excalibar, NY NY, Trop, and MGM Grand via the tram in the hotel and sometimes a bridge or 2. You can also walk through the Shoppes at Mandalay Bay to get into the Luxor, which we didn't find until the last night we were there. If you're going any further down on the strip, I recommend taking a cab. We found ourselves making our way over to New York, New York every night because it always seemed like there was so much going on over there. It's also a bit more laid back than Mandalay Bay. Overall, I definitely enjoyed my stay at Mandalay Bay. I would stay there again, but I'm still looking for my favorite spot in Vegas."

    "content": "I'd like to first state that for quite a while, I was absolutely in LOVE with Mandalay Bay. I travel to Vegas about 2 times a year for leisure. Mandalay was the ONLY place I would stay, after first staying there 6 years ago. Prior to that, I'd stayed at MGM Grand once and Paris. After my first stay at Mandalay, I swore that I would never stay anywhere else on the Strip. Well, 2 years ago, I did a quick weekender with family and stayed at the Wynn. OMG! What an experience that was! I'd found a new place to stay in Vegas. There is absolutely NO comparision between the two properties, THEHotel excluded. After Wynncore, there's no way I could go back to Mandalay. Well, last week, I did. We flew in for Memorial Day weekend, and stayed at the Encore for 3 nights, at a rate of $119/night. Again, Encore and Wynn were absolutely PERFECT in every way. Service, staff, decor...all A+. We ended our stay at Encore on Wednesday, and travelled down the Strip to Mandalay Bay for a couple of nights at $86/night. It was like Night and Day. The Check in staff was rather underwhelming. She couldn't care less that we were staying there and spending our hard earned $$$ there. I'm not expecting flip flops or anything, but come on now....a smile? Walking into the room...it wasn't so bad. It was neat and tidy, but certainly not on the Wynncore level. Perhaps I should have booked THEHotel instead??? Anyway, we tried to make the best of it. After all, we were still in Vegas, right? We were on the 23rd floor and the elevators took absolutely FOREVER! It was a complete zoo, whenever you tried to go up to your room, with crowds lined up in the elevator hall. Uggggh! It seems like Mandalay is now more 'family' focused, and there were a million kids running around. And considering that I was on vacation to get away from my kids, I wasn't too thrilled about the vibe of this place now. Later that night, as we readied ourselves for a night out, I noticed a loud gurgle coming from one of the sinks. Ha Ha! No big deal, right. Well later, at 2:30am, when trying to sleep, the gurgle was most annoying! In the am, we also discovered that now, the toilet wasn't functioning. WTH? Rather than call, we went down to the lobby around 7:30am, to discuss the issues we were having. They politely offered a $75 food/entertainment credit, good for any restaurant/bar onsite. Okay...not bad. We'll take it. Breakfast at Red, White and Blue Cafe...very average. To the pool! Because it was still early, we found seats...the loungers/deck chairs are absolutely the cheapest money could buy...from K-mart, I'd bet. By 11am, it was a complete zoo down at the pool. Too many people...not enough K-mart loungers. You have people sitting against the wall, in walk ways, anywhere they could find an open area. How tacky is that? Regardless, we made the best of it and worked on our tans as if no one else was at the pool. Back up to the room. Housekeeping staff was awesome...she was nice and accommodating. Dinner at Stripsteak....average at best...beware of the Mac-n-cheese! Did some gambling and won a little bit of money. While sleeping, the gurgling pipes were at it again. Vegas vacation almost over now....time to check out. Online system doesn't seem to reflect the $75 credit. Go down to the front desk. It's a complete madhouse down there! Angry people trying to check out, mixed with hyper excited people trying to check in and begin their vacations. ALL lines are extra long and very slow. We wait in line....27 mins. Desk clerk says the $75 credit is separate and tells us that StripSteak isn't covered under the credit. WTF? After some tactful explaining/negotiating, she finally did some math and deducted $75 or so from the final bill. Total time spent checking out, including the crazy wait in line...43 mins. All I could think about was the laid back, calm and 'baller' environment over at Encore. Back in the day, like I said before, I loved Mandalay Bay. Now, after getting a taste of the good life at Wynncore, there's no way I would ever go back to Mandalay. If you're okay with an average room, on top of an average casino environment, with sub-standard service from the front desk reps, and a seemingly always over crowded pool area, then Mandalay will fit the bill."

I went to the concierge desk and they recommended restaurants (which the hotel has many great choices) and shows. The recommendations were great. Once we arrived at the room, it was amazing. The bed was very comfortable, the bathrooms were large and luxurious. We opened up the floor to ceiling window to a view of the LV strip with beautiful mountains in the background. We visited several casinos during the week and Mandalay Bay was by far the cleanest and less smokey ( Neither of us smoke). The only downside to the hotel was when I booked there were no rooms availabe for the last two days, so I booked at a neighboring hotel. However, once I arrived they did have rooms available but not at the conference price of $179. They were jacked up to $310 a night. After the move, I wish I had paid the extra and stayed at Mandalay Bay because the other did not live up to it's level of comfort. I will be visiting again."

    "content": "Came to LV for the first time with kids on the way back home from a Cali trip. It still isn't kid friendly at all I would say. NO changing tables in any restroom. Not that this was a disappointment, I wouldn't recommend ever taking kids to Vegas but we had to stop somewhere so this worked. (And give ourselves a little grownup time after all the Disney madness.) With or without kids, this is now my number one for Vegas. Simply amazing. When you first walk into the entrance and lobby it gives you the feeling like you will be treated like royalty. Premium quality decor is everywhere. We enjoyed prompt and polite response from bell desk, baggage service, valet, room service, dealers, casino hosts, and cleaning crew. The rooms weren't as updated as expected but still nice and large. Huge bath. Sheets were clean. Wife loved the spa. The pool is the best out there. The casino is a hopping fun place. The party pit area is a blast. Only drawback would be the higher table minimums. If you've been to LV a few times you realize it makes sense to stay in the same casino for most of the trip, and this place has it all. If its your first time, you may want something more central, though with the free tram, Mandalay is just as close to anything as the MGM Luxor or the Tropicana. Be careful though, this place will suck your wallet dry, even if it's worth every penny."

    "content": "I was disappointed with the hotel because I had chosen it because of the large number of swimming pools which I thought would give me access to one which was a bit quieter (I am in my 60s but a keen swimmer). The reality was that the weekend was fine - all pools open but dutring the week one pool was closed and this meant other pools were busier. However apart from that, it was OK. Typical of a strip hotel but with many fime dining restaurants which were out of my purse. However there was a good basic restaurant for breakfast, etc. I must say that I preferred the \"Daillies\" restaurant at Planet Hollywood where I also stayed. The free \"tram\" to Luxor and Excalibur was useful in getting around at the bottom end of the strip. Having used the monorail when staying at Planet Hollywood, I wouldn't recommend it, as you had to walk about a mile from the entrance to the hotels to get to it, which to my mind rather defeated the object of using it! The decor in the Mandalay Bay is beautiful and the staff helpful. When we booked in, the room we were given overlooked the pool and not the strip which is what the \"Virgin\" holiday brochure advertised. I rang reception and was immediately reallocated to a strip view room without even having to go to get another key. (Isn't technology wonderful) A downside to this, and all hotels I have visited on the strip, is that there is no facility to make tea or coffee in the room. Also access to the Internet is pricey $1 for 1 minute - with a minimum $5 charge."

The beds are amazingly comfortable and the bathroom in huge with a soaker tub, separate rainforest style shower, double vanity and flat screen tv. Pool area was nice but the water was freezing! I didn't go to Moorea Beach until the second last day there and wish now that I had shelled out the extra money each day. Service there was fantastic and the lounge chairs much more comfy than the ones near the regular pools. The only 2 complaints I have would be the lack of service we received from the cocktail staff. I waited an hour before we finally saw a waitress and when we did she informed us that she was not serving our section. But at least she did send someone over to help us. My other complaint is a personal preference more so. MB is located at the end of the strip and the free monorail runs at odd hours. So if you are later than 11pm you have to walk through Excalibur and Luxor to get to the property. Knowing this now, I would probably stay somewhere closer to other hotels. But other than that.... a fun and relaxing stay."

    "content": "We stayed at the Mandalay Bay for 4 nights in May 2010. This was our first time to Vegas but we have travelled a fair bit in Mexico, U.S. and Canada. We flew with Allegiant Air out of Grand Forks \u2013 it is way cheaper to drive and fly than to take a flight from Winnipeg. We were told by Vegas veterans that we were in Vegas during the slow season. It was busy but not unbearable. I don\u2019t know that I would want to be in Vegas during the high season \u2013 it might just be too much crowd for me... Accommodations (room) We were put into what they call a 550DR room on the 31st floor of the hotel overlooking the strip. The view was great and we slept with the drapes open every night. It was neat to peak over at the lights of the strip while lying in bed. Our room was very clean and the bed was super comfortable. I can honestly say that I have never slept so well in a hotel bed. Some have mentioned the gap in the bath room doors as being a big issue. Honestly you would have to try to peek inside. I can\u2019t see this being a big unless you are traveling with a plutonic (and pervy) acquaintance. There is a safe in the room which was a nice feature. The bar fridge and snacks are horridly overpriced (predictable) but there are places to grab some near the hotel. Not being able to use the fridge in the room for fear of bar charges was a negative. Hotel layout, location etc\u2026 The Mandalay Bay is more of a resort than it is a hotel. There is an awesome beach onsite which screams resort. The place is big \u2013 maybe too big. Even after 4 days we did have the full grasp of the layout. We were not on this trip to gamble but the Casino onsite was nice. My wife and I are non-smokers and are quite sensitive to any amount of smoke since we grew up with chain smoking parents. Cigarette smoke was barely noticeable in the hotel, unless you were next to someone smoking. This was one thing we were worried about going to Vegas. Perhaps it\u2019s worse when it busier but we were not bothered on our trip. The hotel is on the end of the strip. If your thing is to be in the middle of the strip mayhem the whole trip then this hotel might not be ideally located for you. We on the other hand loved it. It was nice to go and get a little crazy but then be able to get away from the bustle of strip. I was little worried before we left about being on the end the strip because of a knee injury. I pleased that getting to the busy sections of the strip form the hotel was easy. There is a monorail that leaves the hotel and drops you off at the Luxor or the Excalibur. There is also the city transit system that runs nice double decker buses called the \u201cDeuce\u201d that runs up and down the strip. Three day passes are a good investment and reasonably priced. Restaurants and bars Generally speaking we did not eat at the Mandalay Bay much except for breakfast. They have a great tasting and reasonably priced breakfast at the House of Blues. We also had dinner at the Burger Bar one night. The burger was good but not the spectacular burger experience that I was hoping for after checking out the hotel website. One neat bar that we did not end up going to in the hotel was the -5\u2070 Ice Bar. For anyone who is from a warm place (unlike Manitoba in January) I would recommend it. We did not go in because frankly at -5\u2070 C I have been known to bbq on my deck in a t shirt. All other meals/drinks we had were outside the hotel. If you want to grab something quick and cheap there is a food court between the Luxor and Excalibur. In fact we ended up having dinner at McDonalds on the way back to the hotel 2 nights. Not a very vacation like meal but it was perfect to fill us up after the strip. We had lunch on the strip at the Cabo Wabo cantina. It was a great meal with great drinks but certainly what I would consider on the expensive side. The food price wasn\u2019t too bad but our $12 margaritas seemed steep. It was however the best margarita I\u2019ve ever had! \u201cDon\u2019t let dehydration ruin your vacation\u201d One of the neater things on the trip was \u201cvendors\u201d on the street and overpasses selling bottled water. The desert (Vegas) is a hot dry place. Some ingenious guys sell bottled waters for $1 and their sales like is \u201cdon\u2019t let dehydration ruin your vacation\u201d. Neat thing is that this is the best deal (for consumer and seller) going in Vegas. At $1 dollar you\u2019re getting a bargain vs. buying in a store on the strip and the profit margin for the sellers is in the 100\u2019s of percent range. At first we thought these guys were destitute guys who found an alternative to begging. But when you really think about these guys are entrepreneurs. As a business guy I thought this was really neat. Maybe I can sell this idea to the Sharks\u2026 Beach (pool) The \u201cbeach\u201d (pool area) is really awesome. The lazy river is really quite a neat concept and it was fun to play around in. Kids loved it and adults acted like kids when in it. The wave pool looked interesting but we did not try it since I was nursing a knee injury on this trip. Bar service was quite expensive at the \u201cbeach\u201d ($12 Pina Colada) so unless you have deep pockets I would suggest it is a place to relax and enjoy the \u201cbeach\u201d more than a place to drink by the pool. Obviously a big difference here with our Mexico experiences. Shows, exhibits etc\u2026 We went to see a Cirque show called Myst\u00e8re at Treasure Island. I went in with low expectations and my wife went in with high expectations. We both loved the show. To my surprise there were a lot of laughs to be had during the show in addition to what you would expect a cirque show to be. I highly recommend this one. The Bodies exhibit was on at the Luxor. It was a very interesting experience for us. It is not for everyone however. If you are queasy don\u2019t go to this one. If you are interested in anatomy or are curious as to why part of your body hurts (or hurt) you will enjoy the experience. I felt that I left there having learned something about anatomy. The ethics behind such a show may be a bit questionable in my mind however. But I would go again\u2026 Tournament of Kings is basically what was at one time called the Medieval Times show. It is a dinner theater in an arena setting. You eat Cornish game hen with your bare hands while you watch knights on horses battle it out in a contest of skill. We loved this show and we felt like we were right into it cheering for our dark night. I don\u2019t usually cheer for the bad guys but I did on this evening. Treasure Island has a free pirate show. It consists of attractive scantily clad sirens on one ship and (what my wife called \u201chot\u201d) pirates on another. The show was worth every free penny we spent to see it. One piece of advice on this one - the later show seems to get cancelled a lot due to wind in the evening. If you want to catch this show I suggest going to the earlier show. The Bellagio has fountains in front of the hotel that run about every 15 minutes. It\u2019s something to see especially at night. Again being a free show it\u2019s worth every penny. It wasn\u2019t really my thing but it was okay. The Bellagio also has a butterfly garden in the lobby. No live butterflies but my wife enjoyed the statues and all the flowers. Again worth every free penny. We are Canadian and I am an avid hunter and competitive handgun shooter. One thing I wanted to do while in Vegas was to shoot some machine guns. Machine guns are a real rarity in Canada so it was a unique opportunity for me that was favorable to joining the Canadian Forces and doing a tour of duty overseas in the Sandbox. Based on reviews I chose to shoot at Discount Firearms in the hopes of being treated as a gun guy as opposed to a tourist. Discount is a humble little place but I got to shoot some neat stuff and wasn\u2019t treated like an idiot. I would go back but I may try another one of the places in town just for variety. One piece of advice on buying show tickets \u2013 to be taken with a grain of salt as we were not in Vegas during the busy season. Don\u2019t buy tickets before you get to Vegas unless you are worried about sellouts. We bought most of our tickets from discount places along the strip. The only exception was the last show we saw which we just bought tickets at the box office. Even then I believe the tickets were cheaper than what we could have bought prior to arriving in Vegas. Here\u2019s the thing\u2026 You will save some money buying tickets at the discount places but you then have to take a voucher to the box office at the hotel where the show is to get the actual tickets. This will save you some money but cost you time in Vegas. In one case we ended up in a line at the discount place for 45 minutes and then 1 hour at the box office just before show time. If you get to the box office earlier in the day the lineup probably won\u2019t be such an issue but you have to go there. If you buy your tickets at the box office expect to pay full price but it will be much faster. For our last show we bought at the box office because I did not want to stand in another line. Like I said it\u2019s your choice: cheap but cost you time or closer to full price but a faster process. We loved the Mandalay Bay and will stay there again if we go back to Vegas."

It had two nice sized closets in order to store your clothes. The shower was a little small. In order to get two lounge chairs next to one another around a pool, you had to get in line outside at 9AM.

    "content": "I have been visiting Las Vegas for a decade and since the first trip I have aspired to stay at the Mandalay Bay. Now I have I am not disappointed that I did. I was lucky enough to find a promotion that allowed us to stay in a 750 GR suite for the same price as the bottom-rated 550 DR room. On check-in we were delighted to get a suite at the end of the corridor (last but the very end suite) on a high floor with a stunning view straight up the Strip. That really is a great view, even if the whole right side is airport. Mandalay Bay is a classy hotel. Not burdened with the need to make everything so over-the-top and fake as the more themed hotels it's just well designed and decorated. It is looking marginally dated compared to some of the newer properties but I would definitely class it in the top bracket of hotels whilst it's rates are usually far from it. The obvious and unignorable flaw is the location, but once you have gotten your bearings (never easy in any Vegas hotel) you can follow a foot and tram route to get you to mid-Strip in under thirty minutes. Vegas regulars will know this is not bad going. Strangely I was actually pleased to have a couple of issues (tiny things) to test the staff with and the resolutions were swift, complete and courteous. So, the ten year wait was worth it and I am extremely pleased to have finally stayed at Mandalay Bay. However, this close to one trip and with another not yet planned, I suspect I have got it out of my system and will look next time to upgrade another notch and be more central. Great hotel, though. Great. And the pool... wow!"

Staff was helpful and nice. Loved the pool and beach area-they need more beach chairs, Saturday there were way more people then chairs and it got a little crazy.

So we dragged our luggage to and fro until finally finding the desk we had to stand for 20 mins. in line to be seen. This was after travelling for 13.5 hours as the plane stood for 1.5 hours on the tarmac waiting for permission to take off. The room was lovely with plenty of space (550 DR deluxe room) which is the basic room with a partial strip and pool view. Everything was extremely expensive. To eat or buy anything and hire anything. We hired a Cabana by the lazy river for 1 day but that was spoilt by the cost and the music that was constantly played over the loud speaker system. The Cabana had a flatscreen TV and ipod docking unit which we could not use because the music was too loud. It drowned out everything. There was a fridge, which was nice with a stock of soft drinks and ice (all part of the Cabana hire) A waitress was there to supply anything we needed. Although the Hotel was sort of 5 star it was spoilt by the cost. An evening meal for 2 without spirits (just diet coke) came to $60 + gratuities and a breakfast was around $40. The Hotels were far apart although next to one another. We did travel down to the cheaper end of the strip ie: circus circus was about $24 for 2 for a buffet brunch + gratuities. Because we were down the posh end of the strip I would suggest going to somewhwere like New York New York to stay as you would be in the centre of things plus it would be cheaper to stay and eat. This would also save on taxi fares. Overall we enjoyed our holiday. Go with plenty of money especially $1 dollar bills for the tips, as nearly everything had a tip of $3 or more."

    "content": "Let me preface this review by stating that I was attending a conference at this facility so I will acknowledge that they probably had more guests than usual at this time. That being said, the issues fall into three major categories: Reservations, Facilities, Service. Upon looking at the list it items I just wrote, I kind of wondered what's left that Mandalay Bay does well - right now I see it as one item, the Casino. Smoking is allowed in Mandalay Bay, but you don't really notice it in the Casino, very well ventilated and there's a walkway around the edge of the Casino that doesn't force you to walk through it to get anywhere. Now that I've covered the single good thing, let's get to the areas where they could use some improvement: Reservations I received a complementary upgrade to a suite at THEHotel which is the slightly more swank side of the Mandalay Bay resort. Since I arrived on a late flight, not only did the reservations desk not put me in the THEHotel, they didn't even give me the room type I requested. When I called to the front desk they casually said that \"room occupancy is based on availability.... blah, blah, blah\" - translation \"We overbook our hotel, so be glad you got a room and shut up.\" The room I received was in the \"SH\" tower and it was clean and comfortable, but nothing to write home about. Just a note about the room, it was on the 27th floor and it was absolutely silent, you could barely hear the rooms next door. Facilities Getting to the room was a challenge, even with eight elevators (just for floors 18-36) you could bargain on a 4-7 minute wait on average, longer if there's a crowd. This takes us into the facilities issues. Generally the place was pretty clean, but the conference center seemed to have some sort of problem with flying insects - moths, butterflies, etc. They were in a number of the conference rooms and in the large ballrooms. If you manage to get done with your conference agenda early, make sure you hurry to \"The Beach\", the wave pool at the hotel. You need to hurry because the hours are only until 6:00pm, according to the hotel staff (polite but less than friendly or helpful). The only afternoon I made it there was about 4:00pm, on the way in they told me it was closing in 45 minutes for a private function, great, the one afternoon I get to The Beach and I get all of 45 minutes to enjoy it. I'm just thinking out loud here, but I'll bet you could get lifeguards to work evenings too. Service As I stated before the service at the hotel included basic politness and not much more. The worst offenders were the staff at the \"Foundation Room\". This is the exclusive club at the top of one of the towers. I was invited along with a number of other people to attend a function there. I understand that it's exclusive and that you need to be on the guest list to get in, but does the general attitude of superiority and stuble hostility towards the people in line need to continue after you've already determined they're on the list? One of the bartenders gave off a \"I hate everyone at these functions\" vibe and it really showed. Summary I work hard to save money for my vacations as I'm sure a lot of you do. Do yourself a favor, if your going to drop $200+ a night for a hotel in Las Vegas, don't do it at Mandalay Bay, go somewhere that treats you like a guest not an inconvenience. As a final note, as I stated at the top of the review, there was a conference going on at the hotel, but if Mandalay Bays' staff and facility can't handle a big convention without treating the guests poorly, they have no business holding the conference."

    "content": "We went into our trip thinking that the Mandalay Bay would be really incredible, with it touting to be a 4-5* hotel with the best pool in Las Vegas. When we got there, the lobby was beautiful and it was nice to have a separate lobby from casino entrance. We had specifically asked for as high a floor as possible with a view as it was our anniversary. The hotel has over 30 floors, They put us on the lowest of the second section of elevators, floor 17 and with a view of a parking lot. We were alittle bit disappointed (we had stayed at the MGM Signature before and requested certain things and they had granted them to a \"T\", so we know it is possible if the front desk/hotel really wants to). Nonetheless, we had just arrived so we didn't want to cast judgement right away. Room: you can't even TOUCH the mini bar or snacks to even look at it or they will ding you. It seems very suspicious and overly paranoid on the part of the hotel. It made us kind of stay on our tippy-toes and not really relax the whole time in our suite. it seems like a tiny thing but it really changes the vibe when everything is monitored to the smallest thing. The rooms were a good size, the bed VERY comfortable and the bathroom very nice. Cleaning daily: It was done but not to the standards that a 4* hotel should require. Basically the bed was made and new towels provided and that's it, one day even the dirty cups from the night before weren't even replaced and we had to keep asking for more shampoo and conditioner and every day it varied. One day only shampoo and conditioner and no body wash or lotion, the next day body wash and lotion but no shampoo and conditioner or one day only mouth wash and nothing else. it was just REALLY WEIRD. maybe the hotel's wages for their cleaning staff is very low and they just dont care but we purposely left good sized tips every day before we left so that it would motivate them to treat us well, but nothing really delivered. We felt ripped off. The good thing was when we checked out we did complain and they deducted the service fee off our room but it's just too bad that a highly rated hotel needs to be reminded of this by their guests. Finally, the pool, it is huge and lots of different options but a couple of pools were closed and not very much shaded areas. My husband is extremely fair-skinned and I'm not, so we need that option of both sun AND shade but we really only had it in the one pool and all the loungers on the beach were so closely stuck together, that there was barely room to walk between them. It basically felt like the hotel tries to fit as many people as possible into one area. And the music blares all day long. Since they have so many pool areas, they should make the beach area the main party area with loud music and leave a couple of the side pools quieter and more peaceful for people who aren't coming to strictly party. The Gym: They were doing renovations on the gym connected to the hotel so it was closed and we had to use the one that is part of the spa. They charged us $20 a day PER PERSON for the use. Ridiculous considering it is not the fault of the guests that the gym is unavailable. The hotel should cover the costs for all guests who want to use it. Isan't the gym one of the amenities listed in their hotel after all?!?!?! Our review is strictly for the room, pool and hotel service as we didn't check out any restaurants except the Verandah at theHotel and the Cafe by the elevators. All in all, we thought the service of the hotel was just sub-par to not too good. It's only because we have stayed at similar rated hotels and had MUCH MUCH better service, you can read our other reviews and see that we are not super picky hotel guests. We just like to stay at a nice hotel and expect certain standards and have them deliver it. That's why we choose 4 - 5* hotels. It's a true disappointment when the hotel tries to say it is a 4* hotel but only has 3-3.5* standards in alot of their facilities. Would we stay here again? Nope, too many other options in LV Would we recommend it to others? Nope."

Wanted to order snacks at the pool ,we're told the staff can't get that for you but YOU can go to the snack grills and bring it back to you chair! Get Out! Really! Oh man I just could not believe the lack of courtesies. We had to ask a lifeguard where the hell a waitress was for our first drink order and I mean we were patient and really waited until we started to seek someone. This was on a Wed. our first day at the pool.Rude dealers too, those uptight squinty eyed looks abound at the tables.We like dealers that like their jobs thank you. Too bad because it should be a nice hotel its just the clientele they attract and the obvious lack customer service they demand from their employees. I should say if you are very easy going it should be a fine place for you especially with kids"

I love the entire complex from; rooms, suites, views, many amazing restaurants, clubs, stores, bars, casino, spa and amazing pools. I am very glad it now has a Starbucks inside of the property. I must say that I was disturbed by the cleanliness and need of capital improvements I noticed during my last one week stay. It appears that since MGM Mirage got in a tight financial spot with its City Center project this last year, that it isn\u2019t putting the needed financial capital into its other great assets like Mandalay Bay. Please clean up the Mandalay Bay as it is a much nicer project than the new COLD FEELING City Center project!!!"

    "content": "Having stayed at both Mandalay Bay and THE Hotel in the past and had great experiences, we booked a GR 750 suite to stay for a night on our way from Colorado to California. We have stayed all over Vegas (from Bellagio to Excalibur and everywhere in between) and the Mandalay Bay hotels are among our favorite. Check-in was quick and efficient and our room was great. It was 750 square feet and sloped off to the right from the main room, where there was a nice table with four chairs which we used as a dining table for a room service dinner. The furniture and styling were decidedly modern but with more muted tones to add some warmth to the room. The bathroom was huge with a tub that me and both my young boys with room to spare. The television was a big flat screen and we had a nice view up the strip. The pool area with the beach and the wave machine is such a blast as is the lazy river. There's a nice side area that is specifically for children under 48\", so there are no problems with the waves from the wave machine but they can still enjoy themselves alongside other children. Our one disappointment was room service. The last few times we'd stayed at the Mandalay Bay and THE Hotel the room service was stellar and we were looking forward to our dinner. But it was a disappointment. My kobe beef burger was overdone and my wife's chicken was terribly overcooked (our two year old was chewing for almost a minute on a single bite). The chicken wings were tasty and the caprese salad was very good. We're not sure if we would order room service again, though, and that's really unfortunate. There have been many reviewers who complain about the location and Mandalay Bay being on the south end of the strip. I can't understand why they're complaining. Mandalay Bay isn't misrepresenting where their hotel is. If you want to stay closer to the center of the strip, go up and stay at Caesar's of Planet Hollywood. It's not the hotel's fault that you couldn't be bothered to see where the hotel was when you were making reservations. Mandalay Bay is a great hotel with so much to do on site that you don't even have to leave if you don't want to. There's the pool area, a great casino, some fantastic restaurants and good shopping as well. I'd recommend it to anyone."

We got there quite late and although the room was nice (we had a view over looking the strip), the room was really dirty! Just as we started to unpack and take our shoes off, I went to the washroom and there was vomit on the wall in the bathroom! Vomit on the wall? Can you imagine???? Disgusting. My husband picked up a towel and found that they were dirty too. They had oil stains all over them. So, we called down to the front desk and they said they would move us, so we packed up everything again (we had 2 young kids with us, so lots of stuff!) and moved to the second room. This one was over-looking the pool. Again, we started to unpack and I noticed something shiny on the floor. I realized that it was broken glass! A mirror had broken and it was all over the carpet. We have a baby who was crawling at the time, so we couldn't ignore it. I called down again for the second time and they said they would move us and give us $100 credit towards our bill. Seemed kind of cheap to me, but we agreed. Again, we packed everything up again and moved ourselves to the third room. It was also over-looking the pool and it was okay, but I was so tired of moving by this point that I didn't look too closely at the floor or the walls! I was really surprised that they obviously don't vacume or clean all that thoroughly. It was a huge disappointment. And, oh, by the way, the $100 credit didn't go too far. Breakfast in the hotel was $75 the next morning!!!!!"

    "content": "My wife and I spent 3 nights in Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in April 2010. We booked a 550 Deluxe Room with View but hotel being fully booked, we were incredibly UPGRADED at check in in one of THE 1500 XB SUITE (17th floor, nbr 17135) without any additional charge !!! That's what I like ! This Suite was just excellent, awesome, amazing and I'm not even talking about the view we had on the Strip ! It was 2 large bedrooms, 2 large bathrooms, 1 giant living room with bar and so many huge windows giving us a 270 degrees view on the Strip and around it. Really, if you can afford it, take it ! This Suite is located at the end of each building and we had a direct view on Luxor, Excalibur, New York New York, The Hotel, Mc Carran airport, well it was just great. The swimming pool was really the best we ever saw in Las Vegas, it was hot, clean, with big waves, not overcrowded, with (too much) safety people, around 16 of them were ready to save us in the area of the pool, it's really too much... There is sand around the swimming pool but not inside as we wrongly understood. The hotel is big, clean, friendly, it does not make you feel as being one out of the large number of guests, it is really pleasant to walk inside the hotel as you are not that much disturbed by numerous people presents, when hotel is fully booked (not like in The Mirage...). So, to resume : POSITIVE POINTS : - Suites are absolutely fantastic and beautiful - Swimming pool with waves and sand around it is excellent - Hotel Mandalay Bay, generally speaking is an excellent choice - Friendly and helpul staff NEGATIVE POINTS : - Location is at the extremity of the Strip, so expect to walk a lot or to take taxi... - Expect hotel to be fully booked quite often... That's it, so I definitely recommend to stay in this hotel and to enjoy Las Vegas."

The reception area and all public areas are awe-inspiring! It really needs to been seen and stayed in to be believed! Great restaurants and bars, and fantastic live band who played rock covers on our first night - very good entertainment for a few hours to help set the scene of our stay! The bedroom was incredibly well presented and had great views of the surrounding area - which of course all comes to light after dark! Two large beds, plenty of wardrobe space, a nice desk and chair, TV etc etc etc. The bathroom was lovely, with double sinks and separate/spacious shower cubicle. All tastefully decorated and presented. Although we did not use the swimming pool / beach area - we did see it and it is incredible! Very realistic \"beach\" with waves splashing on the shore, plenty of beds to lay on and of course the sunshine! The only thing I would say I noticed - and this is being really really picky - was that the carpet in the corridor we stayed in was not vacuumed for at least 2 days - this was noticeable because there was debris on the carpet by our door, which was present for days before it disappeared. Other than that - I cannot fault the Hotel for what was another great stay in Las Vegas, and I would not hesitate in returning to the Mandalay Bay for future visits."

The bathroom was also large with a seperate, very deep tub and a large shower. There were two sinks and a seperate toilet. The room was clean well maintained as was the bathroom. I really liked the room and cant find anything to fault. The hotel itself was huge but didnt feel crowded until the weeend when the weekend crowd arrived. There was a fight on at the MGM so Vegas got pretty busy. The swimming pools I loved. There was the wave pool which had the beach -- yes there were lots of sunbeds but we managed to find a spot that felt away from the crowd. I loved feling like I was at the beach without having to swim in the sea!! There was also the East and West lagoon pools which were less crowded and a bit quieter. There was also a bit of shade for my other half who is a shade bather rather than a sun bather!! I cant find anything to fault with this hotel. I loved it and if I had to find something to fault it would be its location. That said I like walking and it didnt bother me being at the end of the strip. I would stay here again in a heart beat."

On the negative side, when we arrived and were ready to turn in for the night we discovered the bed's flat sheet had a large tear in it. Further, the bed was made so that the blanket was next to skin and the flat sheet was above it! It would have been funnier if it weren't also a hygenic issue. We've traveled globally and have never found bedding in this condition! We also asked to check out an hour late (11:00am check out is their rule). Although we had stayed for half a week and although the hotel was clearly not busy with guests they refused. I can see why. If they let us check out a whole hour late they'd have to accommodate other guests. And pretty soon they'd be known for high customer service and who needs that in this economic climate? The room was a nice size and quiet. But the odd housekeeping and poor desk service take away from the good qualities of this resort."

The landscaping outdoors is gorgeous (and surprisingly tropical-looking for a desert hotel). The inside of the hotel is spotlessly clean and reminiscent of Hawaii and/or the Caribbean. We were initially booked into THEhotel, but were instead given an upgraded room at Mandalay Bay (750GR), which was very spacious and had a typically over-the-top Vegas bathroom. The service we received throughout our stay was excellent - virtually no waiting in line! Reasons to stay at Mandalay Bay: a wide variety of restaurants (our favourite: Border Grill Mexican restaurant - the Mexican chocolate pie is to-die-for!); the amazing pool/beach area (don't miss the Lazy River - tons of fun!); the entertainment (we loved Mix Lounge at THEhotel); the Shark Reef (an impressive aquarium). Our only concern was the location, being at the far end of the Strip. For us, it wasn't a big problem, because we like to walk. It took us around 30 minutes to get to some of the more central hotels (like the Bellagio) or about 60 minutes to get to the Venetian. The weather was really nice in late April, so walking was pleasant. In the height of summer, it might be a different story, though... We would definitely visit Mandalay Bay again!"

We chose Mandalay Bay based on the reviews and the smokin' deal we got on Orbitz for my airfare/hotel. You also do not have to pay a 'resort' fee which is nice. The room was beautiful. I asked for a quiet room so we were put in a room away from the elevator but facing the airport. The room was spacious and the bathroom huge. A large tub with a separate shower as well as another door leading to the toilet. The beds were comfortable and the sheets were soft, not the usual threadbare, stiff sheets of other hotels that I have stayed in. We only had a couple minor issues with the room. The doors to the bathroom are made up of 2 swinging doors, one of which never shut completely and would always swing open. Not a big deal but the shower is clear glass so you are giving your roomates a bit of a view unless you put towels over the glass. There is no fan in the bathroom which I thought was odd. Sometimes the plumbing made some very loud noises and varying times of the day. The casino is spacious and not as smoky as others we have been in. Drink service was intermittent, but not too bad. The pools were fabulous. We enjoyed the lazy river, wave pool and hot tub all of the days that the weather allowed. Poolside was busy but not crazy. There were some kids but we did not feel over run by them. We stayed in LV from a Sunday to a Thursday which I would highly recommend to try to avoid the crowds. We did not make it to any of the clubs on site. The only restaurant we ate at onsite was the House of Blues which we thought was overpriced for average food. Most of the hotel restaurants can be found on restaurant.com where you can get Gift Certificates for very cheap. The hotel is located at the end of the strip. But that was fine we us. We took the tram to the Luxor and Excalibur and from there you can walk to NY NY and further down the strip. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and seemed to really care that you were satisifed with the hotel. I would stay at this hotel again."

    "content": "We spent three nights at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino and had a great experience. Check in was very fast (no wait at 5:30 PM) and pleasant even though the hotel's reservation/check-in computer system was down for an overnight software update. This meant that rooms could not be changed unless there was a real problem, which we did not experience. As noted previously, our \"strip view\" look directly at Las Vegas Blvd. and McCarren Int'l Airport, across the street. As Mandalay is the farthest south and still considered \"on the strip,\" there is no other hotel or notable businesses to see directly across the street. But we were on the 27th floor, so the view of the mountains and airport were also enjoyable. Watching a spring storm cross the landscape one day was almost as interesting as seeing the strips flashing lights. Our room was moderately large and comfortable with many amenities. We enjoyed the IPOD docking station/radio/alarm clock and flat screen television. The room was clean and modern, although the lighting was not very bright for the evening. The mattress was a nice pillow top and good linens. Shower stall and tub were included in the large bathroom with a separate WC. One complaint was that the WC door is spring hinged, so always closed but there is no vent for the room so it was always warmer than the rest of the room and smell was vented into the the bathroom/bedroom. Also the bathroom has under-the-counter lighting that was surprisingly bright and could not be turned off! The bathroom door faces the bed(s) and is a double door with spring latch, so it cannot be opened and closed quietly, therefore it is best to leave open at night except for the continuous counter lighting. Luckily, the plug hung down, so it could be unplugged. Bath linens were soft & plush. We also had a great experience with Lost & Found. When leaving our car at Valet Parking, we always took our GPS out of the car. Second night, we went straight to the slots and left the GPS (in a case) next to a slot machine and did not realize it until the following morning. We went by the Security Desk at the casino and was connected to a Lost & Found desk where we left a message. A few hours later, we were contacted that the GPS had been found and was available for pick-up! This saved us a lot of trouble and expense as we were just starting a 7 day driving trip around the national parks! What a relief! Compliments all around. It was unseasonably cold and windy the days we were there, so we couldn't use the pool and lazy river. We did not use the restaurant facilities except for a sweet at Starbucks, which was nothing special. The casino was not smoky tho somewhat busy. Valet Parking was fast and courteous. Mandalay Bay is part of the MGM Hotels group, so many meals and amenities throughout the MGM properties can be charged to the room (very handy). MGM Players Club occasionally offers some great room rate benefits to registered members, which is what lead us to this property. We were not disappointed for less than 4 Jacksons per night!"

The staff is excellent, but the hotel policies are designed to exact every last cent from the customer. Everything requires an added fee. Expect to pay exorbitant fees for anything beyond the most basic items. Hotel rooms are poorly maintained. My door didn't lock, the iron didn't work, the shower had no hot water and the drain was broken. Mini bar rates are obscene. No free coffee (bring your own or expect to pay). Location is at far as possible from anything of interest. Casino is OK, but too few tables to handle crowd. The tram is a joke - it only goes to the Luxor and the Excalibur... and you have to walk through both to exit. I am incredibly disappointed with the Mandalay Bay, and with what Las Vegas has become in general. Greed has ruined an American icon. BTW - I stayed in a five star hotel in London last fall. I paid less and received more. Never again Mandalay Bay."

    "content": "Mandalay Bay is a pretty nice hotel, but it's location among the Las Vegas strip hotels is not so good. It's all the way at the end, making it inconvenient to get to other places on the strip. Aside from the location, the hotel itself is pretty nice. We experienced good service in response to a couple of issues we had with our room. Our room was very spacious, as was our bathroom, which had two sinks. Our view of the strip was incredible - probably the one good thing about the location. You'll get this great view if you stay in an odd-numbered room ending in 201-235. Obviously, the higher up the better. We had a large flat-screen TV in the room, plus a smaller one in the bathroom. Internet was available in the room for a fee. There was no in-room coffee maker, which is something I normally like to have. This could be normal for a Vegas hotel. The beach-themed pool area was large but felt like they crammed as many chairs as possible. Fortunately it wasn't too crowded in April, but I imagine in the summer it feels very cramped. There's a smaller pool area available to those willing to pay an extra fee. The casino had everything you'd expect. The sports book probably stood out the most, with huge screens aligning the wall. While the hotel is impressive, location weighs heavily in my assessment, so my recommendation is to look elsewhere when staying on the strip."

    "content": "This was my first time at MB, stayed at Luxor and MGM in the past, and this beats them both in terms of luxory and atmosphere. Stayed in 550DR Room which was plenty big, nice plasma tv, very comfy bed, floor to ceiling windows, and awesome bathroom. It overlooked the pool and the airport, which wasn't the best view, but we could scope out the pool before going down to gauge crowdedness, which was nice. It also was not noisy to us, as other reviews have said. Location is far south, as everyone knows, but it really wasn't an issue for us. The free tram from MB to Exaclibur was great and is only a 2 minute ride. Total travel time from our room in MB (on the 30th floor) to MGM was literally 20 minutes door-to-door (and most of that was elevator time - more on that later), plus it was free. You can take a cab everywhere else for less than $20 and the airport was $15 cab ride. If you want to see all the hotels on your trip by walking, then stay more centrally, but if you're okay with seeing on the south end of the strip (i.e. MB, Luxor, Excal, NYNY, MGM, Tropicana) and occasionally venturing out to other places, it really isn't an issue. Additionally, there is so much to do on the MB property and on the properties around it, that there really is no need to leave the south end. The restaurants were superb. Had dinner at Stripsteak (prix fix menu) and it was perfect (great food and service). Also ate at Raffles cafe for breakfast which was great food and atmosphere. Had a drink at MixX lounge at the top which was a phenomenal view (but expensive drinks). House of Blues breakfast is not recommended, especially when Raffles is also right there, but that was the only sub-par place I ate (can't comment on dinner there). Casino was well laid out, smelled great, and had really nice lighting. It had every game you would want, plus good blackjack odds. Pool area was also excellent. Was it easy to find a chair? No. But it wasn't like we had to stand - we were able to get one within 5 minutes everytime. Kids were not as prevalent as I expected, though we did go on a Sunday and Monday in April, so that may have had something to do with it. Another good part about the pool is that we were able to bring in our own liquor so we didn't have to pay crazy prices at the bar, just mixers. Only things that I would improve about MB is the lighting in the bathroom and the elevator wait. The elevators were pretty ridiculous, it was crowded pretty much everytime we used them, it looked more like a club then an elevator bank. Even though the elevators were bad, it wouldn't prevent me from staying at the hotel. The most time it took was 5-6 minutes to get from lobby to our room, which is excessive, but not enough to turn me away from the other great things the hotel has to offer. I would definitely return here. Any questions, let me know....."

    "date": "April 30, 2010",
    "content": "My (now) husband and I planned our Vegas wedding at Mandalay Bay specifically for the Valley of the Falls location. It was everything we imagined! Late April is perfect as the weather is not yet unbearably hot. Our wedding date was April 23 and it was a perfect, breezy, 25 Degrees. Aleena from Mandalay Bay was our wedding coordinator and she was excellent. Although she was not present at the ceremony, she planned everything for us from matching my bouquet to a picture I had sent early on, to meeting with Shayne and I a few days prior to the wedding. Two other coordinators were assigned to us; one for myself and the bridal party and another for the groom and the guests. We were asked every possible question via email, fax and telephone throughout the several months of planning. We are from Toronto so we were forced to organize everything remotely (which can be extremely stressful) but, rest assured, things will go smoothly at this venue. Now, on to the not so perfect details. We did have a few issues, but they were fairly minor. We selected the \"Eco Chic\" package. I have added some notes next to what is included. Organic or silk petite bouquet for Bride - did not use Organic or silk Boutonniere for Groom - did not use Wedding ceremony held at our Valley of the Falls outside location - Fab Includes Decor and Chairs - Very pretty! One night in a Spa Suite - We opted out of this because was much to expensive to stay at the hotel. We had the flowers upgraded to offset what we paid for the room in the package. DVD of ceremony - Nice to have. Camera mainly faces the bride. Does not pan around. Photography of wedding party and Immediate family - About 100 pics are taken. The Venue is perfect for this although the photographers are sub-contracted through \"Cash-man Photography\". NO PICTURES ARE INCLUDED in this package. ALL must be purchased separately. 4x6 are $10 and so on... Disc of Thumbnails of wedding images - LOW resolution. Cannot be printed. Only for viewing and/or email very small pictures. Pointless. Virtual Montage of Bride and Groom Photos - Nice - but kind of unnecessary. Fijian sugar natural body scrub treatment for Bride and Groom - EXCELLENT! But, if you have a spray tan - ask for another treatment as it will take it all off! Fresh fruit platter and organic snack basket - this is hilarious. It is one, very small leather bowl of about 4 individual sized bags of pretzels, nuts and 100 cal cookies. One apple, one pear and one orange. Silly. Custom certificate holder - Brown faux leather bound book for the certificate. Not great. Bottle of organic wine - we got real campaign :) Violinist - nice. I was so excited I don't really remember her.. Minister fee - He was fantastic!! Everyone said how great he was. Very nice guy. Complimentary limo ride to courthouse and return to obtain marriage license - This was decent. Driver was very cool. Took about an hour, including the drive to and from the office. Easy. All in all it is quite expensive, but ultimately you are paying for the location. We had 40 guests and it was quite smooth. The ceremony only lasts about 15 minutes. It is VERY FAST. But the setting is so lovely and the pictures last forever so, why not? If you want your wedding to be memorable, go for it."

    "date": "April 28, 2010",
    "content": "Went to Vegas for a triple bachelor party. For some still unexplained reason, everyone wanted to stay at Luxor, because who needs luxury or convenience in Vegas, right? By the time my roomie and I got around to booking, Luxor's prices had gone oddly high and I was able to get a better deal at Mandalay (attached to the silly pyramid via shopping and food arcade) through my MGM Player's Club account. Usually, I'm at one of the Harrah's properties near, you know, other stuff, but so as not to spend 45 minutes getting to and from the rest of the party, we sucked it up at the butt-end of the Strip. To be sure, MB has one of the nicest casino levels on the Strip. It's plush and refined, very clean, and straddles that fine line between being too dark and cramped (Paris) and too ostentatious and unnecessarily perfumed (Palazzo). The fish tank is a nice touch and just the mere fact that the Four Seasons is attached ratchets up the class factor by several points. The restaurants are pricey (really, $3 for a mini bag of chips at Red, White & Blue?) and we generally avoided them, but the morning/brunch buffet is not a bad balance of selection and quality for the price. (As a side note, our group of 20 ate at the Burger Bar, Hubert Keller's 'gourmet' burger place. Service issues aside - like I said, it was 20 guys engaged in varying degrees of immaturity - I was pretty unimpressed with the food. Presentation was on par with Chili's and the ingredients apart from the bacon were pretty standard quality. I was surprised to see a menu with so much attention paid to priding itself on where its meat came from not offering grass-fed beef. Since I try to avoid the corn-fed junk that permeates the American diet, I ended up getting a veggie burger - with bacon - when no one could confirm for me whether the bison burger was grass or grain fed. Oh, and don't bother asking them to change even one of the four side-by-side TVs from the same basketball game to a hockey playoff: we asked four different people and the technology seemed well beyond their grasp.) Anyway, my issues with the stay at MB and why I can't endorse it: 1. The rooms seem to have very nice amenities, but it's waaaay too dark in there to appreciate them (and this is coming from someone with good eyes who hates bright light). Yeah, I understand that a whole wall consists of a (tinted) window, but, if you're doing Vegas right, you're either not in the room during the day or you've got the curtains drawn tight as you try to sleep off the night before. 2. The bathroom door is ridiculous. Apart from being loud to open and close (perfect for waking up sleeping roommates), there's a big gap between the double doors. Maybe that's fine if you're a couple, but in a room with two beds, clearly there's a platonic relationship there where maybe the parties don't want to catch glimpses of each other getting in and out of the shower. Some better soundproofing would be nice, too - I didn't need to hear what went on behind the second bathroom door. 3. Spastic climate control. One minute the air is an Arctic blast, forcing you under all the covers - even those you wouldn't feel comfortable seeing under a black light - and 20 minutes later you're back awake, throwing off all the blankets in an attempt to bring your core temperature down from feverish levels. Repeat this process 10-15 times throughout the night. 4. My biggest issue and main reason I wouldn't have the patience to return: the elevators are insanely inefficient. On floor 19, we'd regularly wait 5 minutes for an elevator down and, often, even then the first few cars would be full. A big part of this might be having all eight elevators on the same button, since while one (usually full) car is stopped on our floor with people trying to cram in for 30-45 seconds, the call button can't be pushed to summon any other passing cars. Seems it might make more sense to split the call buttons on the two banks. This inconvenience is a big issue for me and reason enough not to consider returning. There's also the minor issue I alluded to earlier about being at the absolute bottom of the Strip. The only thing beyond MB seems to be a McDonald's and the airport (maybe Primm). This is also worth noting, since it seems that about half the rooms might forgo a view of the famed 'Strip' for the McCarran airstrip, though I can see where degenerate gamblers could turn the view into a betting scenario of what airline will be next to take off or land (and, being a degenerate gambler, I'm sorry I only now just thought of that). A couple of positive things if you do get stuck there for some reason: The in-room TV lineup is quite ample, even kind enough to include hi-def VS, which served us well for watching the OT of a Caps/Sens game while getting ready to go meet the others for dinner. I feel like we might have missed that in a lot of other hotels. Also, the shower head is pretty fantastic and a bit of an anomaly for the US. Really, I haven't had decent pressure and coverage like that since Argentina or Japan. If I were going to even consider returning, that would be the reason. Of course, until those elevators are updated to work within the parameters of the 21st century, I'll be much happier elsewhere on the Strip."

    "content": "We checked in around 11pm on Easter Sunday. There was 3 staff members checking people in and there was not much of a line at all. The man who checked us in was nice and very polite. We reserved a standard room ( I think they call them \"tower deluxe\" or something). We requested a Strip View if possible. The best he could do was 10th floor pool view room. We accepted and were on our way to the room. Time from getting out of the cab to walking in the room - about 10 min.. The room itself was nice. I'm sure they were awesome when the casino first opened, but, they have kind of let them go a bit. I agree with other reviews before mine that state the room seem kind of run down. The carpet was really worn out, and kind of dirty looking. We also had a couple cheddar cheese sunchips under the desk chair ( the housekeepers must have been in to much of a hurry to vaccum). The nightstands, desk, and dresser all had lots of scratches and knicks on them. Not just on the bottoms near the floor, but also on the top surfaces. The surfaces also had water ring stains on them. I expected alot more from a four star resort. The his and hers closets were cool. The bathroom was really big and very cool. T.V. and all! Only Bathroom problem was that you had to hold down the handle on the toilet for about 10 seconds in order for it to flush completely. The Big Flatscreen in the room would lose picture every few minutes and go black for about 5 seconds at a time then come back on. It happened no matter what station it was on and was a bit annoying. We did not gripe about it because we were not in the room watching t.v. at all. Just a little bit before bed each night. Overall we were let down with the room. Maybe we just got a dud, but after staying at the MGM Grand last time our hopes were that it would be even better because of the price and it being a 4 star. Our room was #10-331. The pool area was great! Everything we expected. Lazy river, wave pool, and about 4 other pools and hot tubs. We found loungers without to much walking around. Tubes are 25 bucks each. We knew that going in so we brought our own. Got them at Target before we left for 5 bucks each. We used their air hose to fill them up and just left them at the pool when we were done with them. Mandalay Bay IS on the strip. However, it's the last casino on the south side of the strip so it is a bit of a walk to get other places. For us the south side of the strip is our favorite. It's a lot of fun, but just a little bit more low key than some of the casinos at the center strip area (we like that). There is a free tram that goes from Mandalay to Luxor to Excalibur. It saves alot of steps, but we found the walk doesn't take that long, all 3 of the casinos are connected by shopping malls and moving walkways. You don't have to go outside in order to get to the Luxor and the Excalibur, which is cool. If we were to return to Mandalay Bay, We would stay at \"the hotel\", we hear the rooms are much nicer and not too much more money."

I walked around for 20 minutes in finding anyone that worked there and he showed no interest in confronting the gang.

When we checked in the hallway carpets were seriously stained, had they ever been cleaned... our room had stains on the curtainsm bed skirt and bed spread... affraid of what may have been seen under black light! The furniture in the room was seriously scuffed up, so much so that it had the air of schabby chique rather than the supposed high class that it was supposed to be. Then we try to have lunch and our account has not been set up, so back to the front desk... then we go back to the room, and our keys no longer work... call down from elevators and 15 minutes later we are back in ou gross room. Did I mention that when I called to confirm my reservations, they could help me for 24 hours, because there system was down for an \"upgrade\".... somehow I think they still need to upgrade. We checked out other floors, and they appear to be in the same mess... definitely time for a refresh of their rooms, and their systems... not sure how management could get away with calling the hotel 5 star.... No where near 5 stars! Will not recommend Mandalay bay or any othe MGM facility. Totaly disapointed|"

When we arrived in the afternoon it was impossible to find a lounger. The quiet South Lagoon pool wasn't open and the main beach area gets unbearably busy. Also the sand actually gets quite annoying. The hotel bars seemed expensive. I know it's Vegas but we preferred to wander to other places. Paying for the internet (why do hotels still do this?). Plus points- The room was great. Very big (for Vegas) and clean with a great bathroom and large TV. We asked for a strip view and although it was mainly of the airport it was still a great view, and the room was very quiet. There are plenty of options for eating/drinking in the walkway to the Luxor which gets you away from the \"casino feel\" of the hotel. It's also pretty easy to get to the strip, either by walking or taking the tram. Despite the issues with the pool. If you get there early then you can spend a good few hours soaking in the sun before the crowds arrive. The hotel feels more open than some of the big Vegas hotels, and easier to get around. Overall it was an excellent hotel and we would definitely return."

We had a fun and relaxing time at the outdoor pool area (best in vegas) which was very busy (get there early), but a little chilly. We brought in our own drinks (just keep it in a beach bag) as any kind of drink (pop or booze) is quite expensive. If you stay here and want to flout around the lazy river, bring your own flout tub as they don't rent them there. You must purchase each tube for around $25. Don't forget to bring your own sunblock, it too is very expensive there. When you make your reservation, ask if there is a convention going on at the resort as it can get very, very busy. We noticed the prices at their restaurants went up when they held a boxing match. If you want to look around the area rent a car (airport is cheapest) bus tours are expensive. We rented a car and drove through the desert which is very beautiful at sunset. Red Rock Canyon and The Valley of Fire is close by and both are very beautiful. You can also drive to the Hover Dam in about 45 minutes during weekdays. Longer during the weekend. Go to Vegas.com for good ideas on things to see and do around the Vegas area."

One thing I loved about the hotel was that it wasn't noisy and overly crowded like some of the other hotels farther down the strip. The outside is beautiful with waterfalls and a great pool area. Even though the hotel is at one end of the strip it's easy to hop on the tram (located in the hotel) to take to Luxor and then to the rest of the strip. We found the best way to get around was by bus. There's a bus stop right in front of the hotel that can take you up and down the strip with multiple stops at various points. A day pass only costs $7 as opposed to almost 20$ for a cab ride. We toured almost all of the other major hotels on the strip and decided that when we go back, we'll definitely be staying at Mandalay Bay again!"

I realize some of my negative points may sound picky, but while I'd usually have no trouble overlooking some of them, it became a case of all these little things adding up to become undeniable. Especially if MB is supposed to be one of MGM's nicer properties. Pros: + Every staffer I encountered was great. All were helpful and friendly. + Nice TV, plus a TV in the bathroom as well. + Separate tub and shower, with double sinks. + Good roster of restaurants, plus easy access to everything at Luxor and Excalibur if you need or want it. Cons: - For all its interior lights, the parking garage is tough to see in, especially with drivers speeding around without headlights on. - Insufficient lighting in the foyer (where the full length mirror is) and in the bathroom. - \"Strip view\" = a view of the airport. Not a big deal, just a slight let down. - Separate closet for the toilet had a noticeable urine odor (ugh) and a door that liked to shut itself quickly. - Bathtub had a weird beige spotted stain down one side - paint, I hope? Plus two hairs. Urrrgh. - Speaking of cleanliness, there was a couple stray things not vacuumed on the floor and a good layer of dust on the minibar items and alarm clock. The clock, by the way, was about 2 and a half hours off. - The furnishings were obviously nice when new, but they have definitely seen wear. Lots of deep scuffs and scratches, including a huge patch on the dresser top, and several discolored spots on bedspreads and chairs. - The deal killer: Yes, the dreaded paper-thin walls. As mentioned in other reviews, the door between rooms is a problem, with a 1 inch gap at the bottom for light and sound. I heard every word from my neighbors without trying, from singing \"Aureole\" over and over to drunken wretching in the bathroom. Bring earplugs with you, just in case."

We prefer this location since it's not as crazy busy like other portions of the strip. However they do get some big name bands performing there and you can hear the concert from your [pool viewing] room. But really it's all about the amazing pools with sand and cabanas. Two lawn chairs, a bucket of Corona, some sunshine and we were set! We caught some awesome cover bands performing [for free] at the pool stage during the St. Patty's Day Festival but the wind didn't cooperate so it was unbearable to lay out after a while. The taxi ride from M.Bay to the Sands Expo was about $12-$15 (before tip) if you're going there for business. The hotel buffet was so-so, we fully enjoyed the bar \"Minus 5\", devoured our frosty Blue Moon beers at the bar, were hot & cold for gambling, got some great gifts at the shops, hardly had to wait for a cab and slept like babies when in the room. This is by far my most favorite place to stay in Vegas to date. You cannot go wrong with Mandalay Bay!"

The mirror was broken while the car was in their possession and it's not their problem.

Hotel has many great restaurants, clubs, and pools. The main (wave) pool is setup like a beach with sand. There is an adults only (top less) pool area which is $20 for woman and $50 for men. This is a great pool to get away from all the kids, if you want to get a lounge chair you need to get there before 11am, the place fills quickly and is not very big. The service at the hotel, pools, and restaurants was very good. Everyone was very friendly and helpful at all times. The room was clean, large king bed, 50\" LCD TV, a large bathroom with a separate glass walk in shower, a large tub and separate room for the toilet. We are not gamblers but noticed the casino was always less then half full and quite as compared to other casinos which always appeared full and active. Maybe due to being at the end for the strip. Found it easy to get to other hotels on the strip either by taxi or using the free tram that connects to the Luxor and Excalibur. From the Excalibur it's a short walk to the MGM and NY. Hotel has a large self parking garage located at the back of the hotel. Only problem was, it's a long walk with your luggage to the lobby, about 10 min. If you stay here, eat at Lupo's. we think it's the best restaurant at this hotel."

    "content": "Spent four nights here while in town to see some shows and visit old friends. Had gotten a discounted rate of $79.99 for mid-week and $129.99 for weekend. Our room on the 27th floor was spacious and overlooked the pool area. Unlike other reviewers, we didn't find the walls thin and slept great each night, especially given how comfy the beds were. While we did notice that housekeeping neglected to remove some dirty glasses one day, our room was otherwise kept tidy, and it was always a relaxing place to retreat to after the hustle and bustle of the Strip. In fact, one of the things we liked so much about the hotel was its very lack of theme. We could enjoy the \"over the top\" decor at other properties and then return to our own accommodations for a respite before heading back out again. Of the hotel restaurants, we dined at two, Red, White and Blue and Rum Jungle. My tuna melt and potato salad at Red, White and Blue was yummy, and my friend said her burger was delicious, but our waitress did disappear for quite awhile and we had to ask for leftover boxes rather than her offering them. For a late Friday afternoon lunch, it seemed like the service should have been better. On the other hand, our Saturday night dinner at Rum Jungle featured wonderful food in a beautiful setting with very attentive and knowledgeable staff. When my friend inquired about specific greens in the various salads, our waiter immediately rattled them off! The band belting out 80s hits at one of the bars on the casino floor was fun, although drink service was really slow. Better was the lobby bar with the two piano players. But to save money on alcohol, I'd recommend visiting the liquor store across the street and having a cocktail or two in your room before spending upwards of $12 on a drink. And if you're offered complimentary admission to the Foundation Room, take it! The view from this bar at the top of the hotel is incredible, and it was awesome to enjoy it without paying the $30 cover. As other travelers have mentioned, the pool area did get very crowded, but we were there on a Saturday afternoon during spring break, so that didn't strike as out of the ordinary. I can see if you intended to spend a few hours on a chaise soaking up sun how it could be frustrating, but we just snagged a bit of sand for our towels and took advantage of the lazy river and wade pool. Definitely amenities worth checking out. Our only real gripe with Mandalay Bay was the painfully slow Internet connection that cost $15 a day. Aside from that, we were really pleased with our choice and would certainly stay here again."

    "content": "Stayed 4 nights (Monday - Thursday) at Mandalay Bay (MB) in early February for a work conference. Not only was this my first time at Mandalay Bay, but it was also my first visit to Las Vegas. My conference was at MB, so it was convenient. If I was going to go to Vegas on my own, I have to admit that MB would not have been my first choice simply because other places like Bellagio, Wynn, Ceasars, or Venetian get all of the hype. Boy was I mistaken. MB was definitely the right choice, not just because the conference was there, but because it totally fit my personality. Let me qualify. If you are all about going to Vegas for a few days, partying and gambling for 90% of the time and sleeping for 10% of the time, then you should probably not stay at MB. However, if you want to do a variety of things, not constantly be bombarded by large crowds everywhere, and still enjoy a decent level luxury, MB is the place. Got a cab from the airport on my own, which was about $15 (with tip). It took only about 15 minutes from the time I stepped into the cab line at the airport until the time I stepped out of the cab at the front door. Check in was a breeze. There was a line, but plenty of agents and everyone was very friendly. My reservation was pulled up immediately and the agent began using my name. I had not specified a room prior to arrival, but asked the agent for a strip view room. She was very accomodating and honored my request. I toted my own bags and they were fine with that, even gave me specific directions to my room. The whole place is spotless and, while you cannot totally escape the smoke from the casino, MB does a nice job of infusing coconut oil into the HVAC so it's toterable and becomes almost unnoticeable after a short time. The room was a normal (550 sf) room and was very clean and well appointed. Some reviewers have commented about the \"wear\" on the furniture and the minibar that charges you if you move things. Let's be clear. The furniture might have a few marks on it, but overall was in very good condition. It didn't negatively impact my overall impression at all. Everything I needed was at my fingertips and the bed was extremely comfortable. Regarding the min-bar, not only does the agent at the front desk tell you not to touch anything or you will be charged, but there is a very obvious sign on the cabinet that says the same thing. It even tells you not to open it if you don't intend to buy something inside and certainly not to try and store anything in it. Anyone who complains about this is being ridiculous. Also, if you ever travel and complain about the charges you incur when using the phone in the room, yet have your cell phone in your pocket the whole time, then you're barking up the wrong tree. Also, I'm sorry that anyone complains about the $15 per day wireless internet. This is a luxury hotel and they all upcharge for items that they can. If you want free internet, stay at the Courtyard by Marriott. What I most enjoyed about MB is that it's at the end of the strip and thus doesn't have all of the \"walk through\" crowds that some of the other mid-strip casinos have. Everyone hanging out at MB, has a reason to be there (casino, show, convention, concert, restaurant). That being said, I found it very easy to get to the other casinos by tram/foot or cab. In fact, I checked out all of the other upscale casinos over my several days there and while each had their own flavor, I was happy that I was able to go back to MB to \"escape.\" I ate at several restaurants and enjoyed several of the nightspots, all of which were excellent. I got good service from very helpful people everywhere. My conference had about 4,500 attendees and we were there with a conference of about 45,000 attendees, yet the place didn't seem crowded. While it is a long walk from the hotel/casino to the attached convention center, the walk serves to separate the hotel/casino guests from those attending conventions, but staying at other properties. Also, the convention space is so massive, that you don't notice the crowds. I will be making a return trip to Vegas for fun and, while I checked out some very nice other places, MB will be getting another reservation from me."

I put $20 in the video poker game at the bar and then ordered a Mai Tai. I was not told until after the bartender delivered my drink - that they don't comp Mai Tais. My husband had ordered a Jack and Coke. He was told that since he hadn't put $20 in the machine prior to ordering his drink - that his drink would not be comped (even though he put money in the machine within minutes of ordering his drink). The bartender was also very rude - it took us about 10 minutes to even get his attention to order drinks. So we spent $40 on games and $23 on drinks within 45 minutes. We were so mad that we left the casino!! Prior to leaving the man next to us leaned over and said that Madalay Bay has gotten really stingy about comping drinks. We won't go back!! Just so you know - we had the opposite experience at the Palm - they comped our drinks at the video poker bar and the bartenders were extremely courteous."

    "content": "If you are a budget traveler this hotel is not for you. If you want a very clean, comfortable stay and a POOL is important (traveled with teens) then this is the place. If you want to be in the middle of the strip action then you should look around the Flamingo as Mandalay is at the end of the strip. You can ride the tram all the way to Excalibur and cross the street to MGM or NewYork. The \"Deuce\" shuttle for $3 ends at Mandalay but you must cross the street to pick it up to return to the strip. Rooms are very nice and clean. Pool/beach has to be the best, however, during HOT months it may be uncomfortable due to lack of shade; we traveled in Spring so it was perfect. If pool is not important then go for a cheaper deal. Restaurants are a little pricey but the \"coconut pancakes\" at Raffles are a must. Starbucks is the cheapest place for a \"light\" breakfast or you can cross the street to McDonalds. You can walk/tram to Luxor and excaliber for cheaper family eats. Did the Gospel Brunch at House of Blues which was very good. Did the \"Viva Elvis, Cirque de Soleil\" show...FAIR only...not recommended."

We like it being at the end of the strip and with the tram that will take you to the Excalibur, it isn't that bad to get to other areas of the strip. It is nice being able to walk through the shops to get to the Luxor. Hussongs Cantina was yummy and fun! Great margaritas. Try Tender Steak at Luxor. A little pricey, but well worth it and the service is fabulous! We also love the Gospel Brunch at the House of Blues. Great food and a perfect start to your Sunday. The rooms are always comfy, quiet and clean! We have stayed at other hotels in Las Vegas, but we always prefer the Mandalay. Can't wait to come back!"

Internet was a $15/day charge-- a bit annoying but there were free hotspots elsewhere in the casino/restaurant area. Pool/beach were also very nice (but a little hard to find a chaise). The restaurants in the MB are gorgeous but a bit on the pricey side for kids. We found the food court in the Luxor next door on day 2 and loved the ESPN Zone in NYNY. Didn't have a ton of interaction w/ the staff but everyone was nice and helpful. Would definitely stay there again."

The pool area is great but full of famlies/kids. If you have kids, it's great. If you are with adults, as we were, be prepared to be surrounded by kids at the pool. I was hoping for an adult playground but found it to be Las Vegas Elementary. As a resort, it is a great place to stay/play for families. It is at the absolute southern end of the strip and the monorail (from Excallibur to Mandalay) closes at 11PM. Bring your walking shoes if you plan on wandering the heart of the strip late at night. The casino and restaurants are nice. If I had it to do again, I would have stayed at a hotel near the center of action on LV Blvd."

The casino is beautiful and the shops are great too. But again, none of the night clubs at the hotel seemed that exciting to me so you will probably have to leave the hotel if you want to go to one of the popular clubs. My favorite part about the hotel are the beautiful pools, one of which is like a beach (with sand and all). I also liked that it was one of the few nice hotels that had great online discount codes that can also be used for over-the-phone reservations. Overall, I would probably stay there again, but would consider renting a car."

    "content": "My husband and I stayed at Mandalay Bay from 3/9/10-3/14/10. We only stayed here because there was a concert there we were attending and received a discount from the concert event. We paid 99 a night and I feel very badly for the people writing reviews saying they paid over 200 dollars to stay here...it's definitely not worth THAT much money. We flew from Fl so we were very tired when we arrived and lucky for us the room we booked was not available. We booked a king room and the new trainy girl said for the same money she could give us 2 queens. We thought that was considerate of her to down grade our bed size for the same price. We told her that we booked the king room through the website and that's what we wanted. Well after pitching a fit, she said she'd have a king ready in about 1 hour b/c they were cleaning it. The manager was right there and didn't apologize or offer anything for our inconvenience. Even though we were tired, we decided to wait for the king. We were hoping they would at least give us vouchers to eat, upgrade us for a night or anything b/c we had to wait, but they didn't feel it was necessary. Soo we just hung out in the lobby with our luggage for an hour until they called our cell phone to let us know the room was ready. We were on the 12th floor, view was of the pools/beach and airport. We heard the helicopters and planes but it really wasn't so loud you couldn't sleep. The only problem we did have was when there was another concert on their beach and we could hear it perfectly as well as the screaming from the crowd right through the window. The room was nice. We loved the flat screen tv in the bathroom...that was fun. The bed was decently comfy. Well, after getting undressed and trying to relax we got a knock on the door. After trying to get dressed to answer the door, the maintenance man almost started to come into the room b/c nobody was answering quickly enough. He said he was there to fix the drain in the shower, which we never called about. Well, he came in anyway and fixed something with it. I thought it was pretty rude to almost come barging in and nobody notified us that housekeeping called mainenance so we called down to the desk and we actually received some customer service. Surprise for us. They actually comped us for the buffet downstairs. Also, we asked if we'd be charged to use the fridge and when we said we'd like to use it but were scared to open it b/c of the charges, they brought us a mini fridge free of charge. So the location of this hotel is really why we'd never ever stay here again. It's so much farther from the strip then you'd think. We figured no big deal, we'll take the monorail and we'll walk. Well, when you're up late at night the monorail is out b/c it closes at 10:30. Walking from the strip through Excalibur, then Luxor and then through Mandalay is a loooong haul. We took taxis after awhile b/c my husband was sick and too tired to walk from the hotel down to the middle of the strip. The taxis are a total rip off. Instead of taking the strip they took the back roads and highway every single time. It was about 15-17 dollars a ride. Even when we wanted to go to MGM which is about a 5 minute car ride, the guy took us all around town. 15 dollars! to go 2/10 of a mile. It's just very inconvenient if you are wanting to go do a lot of things on the strip. If you're satisfied with just staying at the hotel and/or the other 2 hotels next door then this hotel would be fine for you (also at a decent rate) But for the same money it would normally cost to stay here, you can find better hotels on the strip or towards the center that are more convenient. Also, the only 24 hr restaurant was Raffles. Because it was the only one open at this hotel, there was always a huge line and all the other hotels were so far you really don't have many choices to eat. They need more restaurants that are open late. They had a hidden food court by the Shark Reef Aquarium but the restaurants weren't even open at 4:00 in the afternoon! We ended up ordering pizza from El Verde which was really good, cheap (10$ for a large) and delivered in 30 min. Look them up if you go!"

Pros: -Checkin was quick and efficient. -Clean, nicely appointed room. Comfortable king-size bed, double closets, a jetted bath and bathroom TV were all positives. -Massive conference facility was attractive, spacious and the layout was easy to navigate. -Hotel and casino is connected to the Luxor (and to Excalibur via the Luxor) through indoor walkways. A tram is also available directly to Excalibur. -Express checkout it nice, but I've been waiting 48 hours for my itemized receipt via email. Cons: -\"Obstructed view\" room had a tiny window on one end of a wall entirely covered with curtains. Didn't measure up to the views in my colleagues' rooms. -A 5-10 minute walk from the hotel escalators to the on-site conference center means frequent trips back to hotel rooms are impractical. -There were frequently lines for elevators on the lobby/casino level. -$14.99/per day charge for internet access (wired or wi-fi). This is particularly annoying for guests attending conferences on-site, or with multiple wi-fi devices."

Wish I could have just moved into that room. Check in was pretty painless. Asked for strip view and got it. Asked for a smoking room and they were booked, so they sent a couple of ashtrays up to my room to accomodate me. Room itself is just sweet. Big, bright and a nice relaxing vibe. Perfect place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas. Bathroom is incredible, has a jacuzzi tub and I was able to watch reruns of Law and Order on the small TV over the sink while I brush my teeth. Also if you have an Iphone,it works like a charm from here. AT&T coverage was great. Just a couple of small details keep me from giving this the full on 5 stars... Waiting for an elevator. Lines were sometimes longer than a free buffet line. Layout of the furniture. Two big windows on the 30th floor overlookingt he strip, One window had a desk facing AWAY from the window. Huh? An even bigger WTF is that the beautuful and comfortable bed is positioned AGAINST the other window. What genius thought of that one? Because I loved this room so much, I was willing to overlook these flaws. Big of me, huh? And lastly Mandalay Bay has the dreaded BUY COFFEE FROM US AT OUR INFLATED PRICES OR WAIT 45 MINUTES FOR ROOM SERVICE OR WAIT FOR AN ELEVATOR AND THEN WAIT ON LINE AT THE STARBUCKS OR ELSE disease that every hotel on the strip has. You get every amenity known to man in this beautiful room EXCEPT a freakin coffeemaker. Well, guess what Mandalay Bay, JOKES ON YOU!!! I walked down the street, bought a coffeemaker for $10 at Walgreens and was in hog heaven every morning. Anyhow, loved the room and would not hesitate to come back here in the future."

    "content": "We stayed at the Mandalay Bay Resort March 7 - 13, 2010. We were in Las Vegas for a concert, and decided to make a trip out of it (it was our first time to Vegas). We arrived on sunday morning, and hotel registration was reasonably quiet. Check in was fast and efficient (but lacking in genuine warmth and friendliness). We reserved a non smoking 750 suite - and received the same with a view of the strip. The room was adequate - clean and serviceable. The furniture was worn and the room had a dated feel to it. I was a bit disappointed with the room amenities (or lack thereof). No tea or coffee making facilities, basic bathroom amenities and no bathrobe. Also, beware the connecting room. Ours was a connecting room and the neighbours were noisy all week and even though it was a non-smoking floor, they were smoking and the smell drifted through to our room. Finally, the Mandalay Bay is across the road from the airport, and you do hear the planes landing and taking off. Now, unless you are spending all day in the room, we were not disturbed by the noise - there isn't much activity in the early morning or late evening. Also, beware when the hotel has a large event on (such as a fight or concert). The hotel is very noisy on the floors and guests do not always observe the rules! We had an issue with the toilet the second day we were there, and it took 5 phone calls and over 6 hours to get the issue resolved. It was after 11pm when it was finally fixed! The Concierge staff were not helpful at all - I went to the desk on 3 separate occasions, and they were unable to assist me all three times. They were simple questions - cost of stamps, parking at Freemont Street, and a request for a map, and I left the desk 0 for 3! Tip - if you need stamps, going to the Business Services Desk - they only charge you $1 for international stamps, instead of $2 in the vending machine at the Concierge Desk! We ate at House of Blues a few times - breakfast was consistently cold (had to send it back one morning as the eggs were stone cold - yuck)! The service was generally good and food was reasonably priced. It is very loud in there when they have live music - and you are charged an 'entertainment tax' when a band is playing. The Bayside Buffet was terrible - probably one of the worst buffets I have ever eaten at. We arrived at 10:20am for breakfast, and they were already tearing down and setting up for lunch (breakfast was supposed to be available until 11am). Much of the food was cold, and I had to wait for items to be replenished. Also, there wasn't anywhere to toast your bread, so I had cold bread. The best meal I had at the hotel was lunch at RM Seafood. My husband is not a fan of seafood, so I went on my own. The staff were friendly and knowledgable about the menu - the was food delicious. The restaurant manager stopped by to chat for a few minutes (like I said, it was quiet!) I had a treatment at the spa which was delightful! The staff at the spa were great. I spent about an hour in the pools and steam room before a mud wrap and massage. My only comment is that the treatment room was close to the gym (I assume) and I could hear the music from a fitness class - not entirely relaxing. Also, I had to leave the treatment room to rinse off after my wrap. Other spas I have been to have a connected shower room. The Casino was not the cleanest - we frequently noticed empty glasses left on tables/slot machines. I don't typically enjoy casinos because of the noise and smoke, but this casino was not too noisy. It was smoky. However, none of the casinos we went to on the strip were able to manage the smoke effectively. The beach was cool - real sand is shipped in, and waves gently crash on to the shore! However, it took a while to get a drink - I finally had to flag down a server, and waited over 20 minutes to get the drink once it was ordered (even though the beach was not very busy!) Overall our stay was adequate - it fulfilled our needs of requiring a place to sleep and eat breakfast! The staff were generally pleasant - the Valet Parking staff were probably the best we encountered at the hotel. This is not the luxury hotel they advertise - they are more concerned about quantitly rather than quality. But that is probably the same for just about any hotel in Las Veags. If you want luxury or quality, you have to pay for it. With that being said, I would recommend the hotel if you are looking for a no frills place to sleep in Las Vegas. We enjoyed being at the bottem of the strip, as it was less busy. But don't stay there if you don't like to walk - it is about a 35 minute walk to the Bellagio."

The only negative is that you have to pay $25 a day to use the fitness center. on the other hand, parking is free and the choice of swimming pools cannot be beat."

The pillow shams also had the same stuff on them. I called down to the front desk to have them send up new ones. Housekeeping came by and took the dirty ones, but did not replace them with new ones until I called again 6 hrs. later (after we returned from gambling and saw they were still not replaced.) When we went to bed and turned the lights out I noticed that I could not see the numbers on the bedside clock, my husband and I both tried to fix it, too no avail. Also the bathroom door was so squeaky I thought we were in a horror movie. I had to leave a note for housekeeping to fix both the clock and the door the next morning. When we returned later that day, both were fixed. We could hear a lot of noise from the hallways and rooms beside us. Also the noise from the airport was very unexpected. There are a bank of 8 elevators for floor 17 - 34. It seemed to always have lineups of people waiting for them, they were slow as molasses. The price was right but the hotel itself is getting a little worse for wear. We have stayed at the Bellagio, Luxor, Paris, Tropicana, Wynn, Encore, Palazzo in the past. I would highly recommend the Wynn, Encore or the Palazzo for anyone looking for classy, clean, quiet, large accomodations."

The rooms were clean and nice, and plenty big. If you love the heat and want to spend it in a fun way this is it. They have servers always around to bring you drinks on the beach as well. It's a little far away at the bottom of the strip but the bus The Deuce goes all the way up the strip if you want to go sightseeing.

It wasn't THAT great. --Just keep in mind its at the far end of the strip, so if you want to be in the middle of things, this isn't your place.

It did take a long time to get to the room from the pool but that is kind of expected with Vegas since the hotels are so huge. I dislike cigarette smoke and was pleasantly surprised when the casino smelled nearly smoke free. The pool area was very nice although overly crowded. It was hard to find a lounge chair and the chairs were so crammed up next to each other you could barely walk in between them. There was a huge section of the pool made for kids...which didn't make much sense to me. Vegas doesn't seem like a very family oriented place but if you were bringing your kids to Vegas Mandalay bay seems like the place to go. It is relatively quiet for a Vegas hotel. On our last day there we found an amazing happy hour at the House of Blues...I think beers were 2 bucks or something outrageous and half off appetizers too. So go there and get sauced up for cheap before you hit the town. The biggest downside for me was the location. It is the furthest hotel on the south end of the strip. Since It was my first time in Vegas I wanted to see everything and walk around. The bus does go up and down the strip but it costs $3 a ride I think (which is ridiculous) and walking is almost faster. Also we wanted to get a bite to eat and a coffee late night and all the fast food and the Starbucks in the hotel were closed. The Luxor next door was a little fast food court that is open late night so that made us happy."

    "content": "My girl friends & I decided to do an extended weekend in Vegas. The group had grown in size as we got closer to our departure date, but out of the initial group involved with setting this up, I was the only one who had ever been to Vegas. From my number of visits I have concluded personally that I prefer to stay in Downtown @ Golden Nugget. Considering that this was most of their first time, they wanted to stay on the strip. Considering we were going in July our main interest was the POOL! We also wanted something fun, modern, and close to everything. So after reasearching (mainly pools) we chose Mandalay Bay. 1.The bathroom was ideal for a group of girls, it had 2 sinks which was nice. The toilet was in its own room which gave us uninterrupted getting ready time! There was a stand up shower & a separate jacuzzi tub. One could shower while the other shaved legs. We just could not have had a better bathroom. The rooms itself was just that, a room. I didn't feel it was any better than any other hotel I have stayed at in Vegas, maybe bigger but we didn't really need all that unused space. We were pretty high up & had a really cool view of the mountains. We watched lighting storms roll in over the mountains every evening. But don't worry, it was still 100 degrees at 9pm! 2. The pool. Spectacular indeed! However, this hotel is very family friendly & the pool especially draws them in, like it did us. The pool was PACKED & there were kids EVERYWHERE! We went to one of the side lagoon pools which seemed to not have interested the familys as much as the wave pool & the lazy river. Drinks at the pool were way overpriced, but we were expecting that. We never attempted the crowd in the wave pool and were in a sea of children in the lazy river. Most without a floaty which I think should not be allowed. The lazy river was not as relaxing as we had imagined. Don't get me wrong, I love children but not on my vegas vacation. Especially because we had mommy's in our group & thats the last thing they wanted to heard on their vacation! Because of how hot it was, we were inside by 10am. The last day we actually joined some other friends at their pool next door at the Luxor & had more of a relaxed modern vibe we were looking for. Even a DJ & I don't remember seeing any familys. The pool wasn't anything fancy but the vibe was what we were imagining for this trip. 3. Hotel. Very nice but after you go into a few, these fancy ones kind of start to look alike. We didn't do any gambling, instead spent our time catching a cab because we were actually much further from everything than we imagined. In reality, 2 hotels away is QUITE A WAYS AWAY! Especially in that weather! The guys that get you into a cab were AWESWOME! Other than that, we didn't deal with the staff much but I don't remember feeling like the service was exceptional or unexceptional. They did let us check in at 11am despite the set 3 check in. That was nice. I do also like that there are ways to easily get from Mandalay Bay to the other hotels without having to meander around the streets. It was frustrating though that there wasn't too much out on the streets near the hotel such as cheaper food & most the food court in the hotel was closed all the time. Plus, you can only imagine how many familes are IN the hotel after spending a day at the pool. Just not the vibe we were wanting from our hotel this trip. One of the nights we went down to Freemont & all the newbies looked to me & said \"now this is what I thought Vegas would be like!!!\" And everyone, even those who have been, left Freemont saying their next stay would be down there! The cab ride to the strip is not too spendy & Freemont is cheaper, smaller,& more relaxed small town vibe. It's not that the Mandalay bay stay was bad, it just wasn't what we were looking for from our hotel on this Girls trip."

It wasn't bad but NO DESK and NO WORK AREA in the room. Had to setup laptop and printer on the living room coffee table and sit on the floor to work. Too many procedures. Too focused on player ratings. I planned a large group and spent a ridiculous amount of money (well above average) in the restaraunts and the revenue for 20+ rooms as well. At every turn, we had issues with service. Many other similarly priced hotels rather than staying here. In the same price range, I'd take Paris 100 out of 100 times after this visit.

If you like to gamble, you need to get yourself a good host, and your stay will be free. When we went in October there was 8 family members in all. We had a 2 bedroom suite plus an extra room, limo service everywhere we went, ate at all the different restaurants including others in the MGM Mirage group, had Cabanna's on the 11 acre beach where we ordered drinks by the pitcher and all the food we could eat, room service on a couple of occasions. We had complimentary tickets to Justin Timberlake and Terry Fator. Our cost for the stay...zero. Our only cost was for the airfare to get there. The cost of what we got for free, out weighed the cost of what we gambled by far. The hotel is far enough down the strip that you dont get huge crowds in the casino, and with conventions always going on the spacious casino never seems crowded. The air is amazing as they must pump something it to make it smell wonderful and not of smoke. They also offer free play that far exceeds the other hotels in the chain. The beds were fit for a king. If you are lucky enough to receive penthouse suites, there is a penthouse lounge with all the food and drinks you want included. We are going again in April and have already been offered the penthouse suite and floor seats for the American Country Music Awards. My host is an amazing person, and bends over backwards to make our stay greater ever time we go. The other nice thing about our host is he will extend the same or exceed the complementary items that are offered by the other hotel chains in Las Vegas. I have sent many people from here in Canada his way, and he has exeeded their expectations. You want to live the Las Vegas experience this is the only way to go."

Also, we purchased a bottle of white wine from a wine store which we wanted to enjoy in the room together. When the bottle was half empty we placed in the mini refrigerator and after cleaning had come through they left our bottle on the counter (which spoils the wine) and a note saying that the \"mini bar\" isn't used for \"personal refrigeration\" and to contact them separately for a \"personal refrigerator\". Also, we decided to use the gym facilities (which were very nice) but were forced to pay $20 PER PERSON PER DAY which I have never had to do before. All in all, the hotel has very nice facilities but be aware of all the incidental charges that really add up."

Checked in at eleven thirty in the morning. The clerk was pleasant and efficient. Not only did we get the non-smoking king on a high floor, we were able to go to the room immediately (it was a Saturday) and had a lovely view of the mountains and pool area. The casino was nice and not \"smelly\" at all. I just cannot take the perfume smells that are in the MGM and the new City Center. Had an immediate headache and had to leave.Hit several times on the Wheel Of Forune slots and the cocktail waitresses kept my glass full at all times. I don't believe I have ever had such good drink service in a casino before. I hate to say it, but I ate at Rick Moonen's restaurant three times while I was there. My husband had meetings to go to and they were such a nice and friendly bunch that I just kept returning. I used a restaurant.com certificate once during my stay there. I have always been of the opinion that no one in the restaurant industry could make a crab cake as good as my own, but I will tell you that RM's comes pretty dang close. The chipotle aioli and jicama slaw was a perfect compliment. I do think that for 17 bucks, you should get two, but hey, it's Vegas. On my third visit, Rick Moonen came and sat at my table and we had a very nice talk. He is really a great guy and was still over the moon the the Saints won the superbowl. Stripsteak and Mix are also lovely dining experiences and there are options for every budget at this hotel. That's what I liked. No need to trek up and down the strip at all. Would I come here on a first visit? No, the hike is way too long to get to center strip. I would come back again in a heartbeat just for a lovely time with my husband, good food and a nice casino. My ONLY complaint is that the pillows were very small almost like travel pillows. What's up with that? Everything else was perfect."

We also had room service which was OK. The casino here is much quieter than alot of the others in Vegas which suited us. The pool areas are great but are very busy (we went end of sept). There is a shopping mall connected which then takes you through to the Luxor where there is a convenient food hall (fast foods). My own issue with this hotel is that I wish it was further up the strip, it is practically the first one and the closest to the airport. All the hotels are connected by monorails or walk ways and taxis are reasonable but location wasn't too convenient. This hotel is defintely alot quieter than many on the Strip and I couldn't fault the service or standard of accomodation."

My husband had a huge bowl of wonton soup with noodles as well as wontons. The menu was interesting, but some of the choices I did not recognize and they may have been a little too different for American tastes. I heard another diner say, \"I'm not eating that\" after whatever it was was placed in front of him. Prices were reasonable--our dinners were about $16 each.

    "content": "During our trip we noticed that some of the employees that worked there were not very helpful or even willing to go out of their way to make us feel welcomed. As a matter of fact there was an incidence that while we were in the casino we were approached by security guard in regards to two inflatable dolls one was female and the other was male. The boys had bought them for my daughter and her fiance as a joke because they were getting married that Saturday the 30th. The security guard asked us to deflate them because they said they were inappropriate and so we proceeded to do that. In the mean time two other guards came up and stood there watching. The server also came up and I noticed she started talking to the one old guard and then that guard and the 3rd one approched one of the 26old man that was my sons friend and asked for ID, so the young man showed him his ID. The guard asked my sons friend if this was a real ID, so then he told him that yes it was, but the guard questioned him some more and asked for real ID, and then my sons friend showed him his passport. Now what we heard that the reason the 2 old guard was there harrassing him is that the server was questioning his Minnesota ID because he had a hat on it and she thought that it was not approriate to wear one because it meant that he belonged to a gang!!!! Wrong on her part! We are allowed to have our picture done with a hat on in our state of MInnesota. I feel that it was a discrimination act on all three of those employees and the inflatable doll being not inappropriate was out of judgement on their part. There was no inappropriate at all! What I feel that is inappropriate is the gogo dancers that are half naked, dancing inappropriately on the tables and the clothing that the servers have to wear that are too short and too revealing especially the women that are over weight and old!"

    "content": "I have never written a bad review for any place we have stayed but this was so bad I feel I should warn people. For some background- we are in our fifties and vacation travel two to three times a year. I had called the day before we left to confirm the details of the trip. I wanted to make sure that we were going to have a king sized bed because it's hard for us to sleep in a queen and they told us we were all set. We arrived at the hotel at 11pm and they supposedly didn't have a king size bed available and told us we could move in the morning. Since it was 2am our time we were exhausted and agreed to do that. Again with the time change we were awake at 7 am and went to the desk to check what time we could change rooms because we wanted to unpack and were told there was a room available. I asked here when it was vacated and she said two days before. We were there for a wedding and a bunch of us met in the casino for the bachelor/bachelorette party. One of the ushers had bought blow up dolls that were about 2 feet long and didn't have anything obscene on them. The only way you could tell one was male and one was female was by their face and hair. We were laughing about them, not really being loud and security came over and told us we had to get rid of them that people were complaining that they were offensive. They were in no way offensive. Come on! We were in Las Vegas with half naked waitresses and half naked dancers in the casino and blow up dolls (with no defining parts) are offensive? The worst part was that four security guards came over and stood there with their arms crossed while the usher deflated them. They certainly could have handled that better- if they had asked them to do it they would have and they didn't need to call every security guard in the place over to make sure it happened. It really put a damper on what was going to be a fun evening for the bride and groom. And to make matters even worse, they carded one of the other ushers (who is 24) and accused him of having a fake id. He had to show his passport to confirm that he was of age and wouldn't take the older folks word for it. I played craps a few times and witnessed the employees more than once being rude to guests playing. Usually they are very helpful and expect there to be some new players but these guys were downright rude. The last time I played two of the employees actually got in an argument over whos turn it was to shoot. Right in front of everyone at the table! In addition to being treated rudely there are other disadvantages to this hotel that I will outline: 1. It is very far away from everything. There is a tram that runs to the Excalibur (which was broken down) but even when you get there it's quite a hike to the strip. 2. The hotel charges $30 per day for the fitness room 3. There are not coffee pots in the room and the room service charge for coffee is $26 4. The buffet is $10 more per day than any other hotel on the stip. If your crazy enought to stay there walk over to the Luxor which is just on the other side of the mall and eat at their restaurant called \"More\". 5. The rooms aren't anything special and the walls are paper thin. 6. Internet is $15 per day 7. If you touch anything in the mini bar for more than 30 seconds you get charged. There are a ton of choices for hotels and I would recommend that you choose another one and do not stay at Mandalay Bay."

What are they hiding I thought to myself... * Furniture is beat with nicks, dents and scratches * Lampshades crooked (nice!) * Chair fabric and carpet had distracting stains (ewe!) * Mini-bar on top of dresser was picked over and half eaten! The cans of Pringles were covered with dust (leading one to ask themselves - are they old & stale too?) ** SERVICE LACKING: When I called down to inform them my mini-bar was half eaten (I really intended to have a snack!), they were satisfied in telling me that I wasn't charged for any snacks (yet that is, we will see upon check-out). I would have rather heard them ask if they could send somebody up to restock it. ***CHECK-IN NIGHTMARE: Check-in was a total CLUSTER! Although there were 8 front desk agents, they each had their own individual line with confused guests cutting. Murphy \u2019s Law would have it that there were \"issues\" happening with all 8 agents at the same time so we all had to wait an unusaul amount of time. All of us were getting frustrated. Eventually a manager had to come out to direct people and answer questions. A manager said it\u2019s done this way (individual lines for each agent) so the front desk agent doesn't get stressed out seeing one long line (GIVE ME A BREAK!). What would have been more efficient, and better FOR THE HOTEL GUEST would be to duplicate how it\u2019s done at the airport or at banks - one line with the front person going to the next available agent."

At this point we had to check our luggage with our airline and my husband said to call the hotel when we got back. They have not been helpful at all - they said they are looking into it and the lady in the claims department \"raquel\" is ignorant. When I called a couple of days later to see what was going on - she said I hope you don't think your going to get an answer anytime soon and it probably didn't happen at our hotel. I'm so furious, obviously it did happen there, our luggage was checked with the bell boy at 1230 and we got it back at 4 pm, there was lots of time for our luggage to be ransacked.

Also there is the deuce bus outside the hotel that goes up the strip. Don't go in January though as the swimming pools were being refurbished so were closed. A lot of shows and attractions were also closed for holidays or renovations. The Border Bar )on the way towards the shark reef and convention centre) is excellent for cocktails.

    "content": "My wife and I stayed at the Mandalay Bay for our honeymoon,over new year 08/09. It was our first time in Vegas and we loved every minute. We choose the Mandalay as we had read various good reviews from Tripadvisor and we were both glad we did. Yes the Bellagio and Wynn hotels are certainly more luxurious but this hotel is definitely the next best thing. The main reason we enjoyed it was the fact that there wasn't any through traffic. I mean somewhere like the MGM Grand were REALLY busy ALL the time as people used it as a throughway to other hotels and the monorail. As far as the hotel it's self was concerned, the rooms were cleaned daily, the beds made daily and the general state of the public areas was excellent. Our room had a great view of the srip (which we paid slightly more for) but well worth it. There is an great choice of food in the Mandalay, so you won't be stuck for anything to eat if you don't feel like going too far. The connecting monorail to the Luxor and Excalibar is great. It gets you that little bit further up the strip without too much effort (and you'll be glad of a rest). In all I would go back to Vegas tomorrow, and would go back to the Mandaly today. Great hotel, great rooms, great casino, great restaurant's and like everything in Vegas, just huge."

Boy the hotel was such a dispappointment! Good thing I only paid $80/night. Who would pay $280/night for rooms at this hotel. First they gave us a smoking room.. when the front desk was called they said.. its an OPTIONAL smoking room.. First of all, there is only a smoking or a non-smoking room.. nothing in between. When asked for another room. they said we dont have any.. The check in time was 45mins long. After surviving a long toss and turn in a bad bed because of the bad cigarette smell.. the front desk was contacted again.. I guess they had a change of staff because all of a sudden at 7am in the morning they had another room ready for use.. which apparently they didnt have at 12am.. umm i guess they clean their rooms early.???? The rooms are filthy, the view was off the roof and AC units. and be prepared to walk 5mins to your room from the parking lot. there is no security in the entrance to the hotels.. so anybody can walk in the go through the hotel.. the absolute worst is the charge for wifi internet access for $15.00/24 hours use! compared to free internet access at sahara lodge motel! What a joke! I am not staying in mandalay bay again and would not recommend anybody to stay at this hotel!"

    "content": "I just discovered this website so this review is a little belated. We stayed at Mandalay Bay for our second visit to Vegas based on some recommendations from family friends. I had stayed at Planet Hollywood before which is right in the center of the strip. We stayed for 4 nights (Wed-Sun) in October 2008, which is also the same weekend as the Barrett-Jackson Auto Show Convention at Mandalay Bay so the hotel was pretty full. Airport Transportation: The first time we went we bought shuttle passes but beware, you may stop at 5-6 other hotels before you get to yours - it took us nearly 2 hours to get from the airport to our hotel so this time we got a taxi for about $14, nearly the same price as the shuttle. Only downside is once we got to Mandalay bay someone backed into our car but the valet staff and our driver were excellent with handling everything. Check-In: We had to wait about 20 minutes to check in due to the auto-show but everything went smoothly and we were given \"tickets\" to use to charge to our room. Only complaint is the tickets were paper so we had to be careful by the pool. This may have changed since we were there. The lobby was pretty and we had a good time people watching. Room: Our room was facing the mountains which was a beautiful view to wake up to. Floor to ceiling windows, huge bathroom with a jacuzzi tub, large shower, lots of counter space. The beds were awesome - we were so tired every night I would've slept on anything but these beds were super comfortable. The room was nice but nothing spectacular. Service: We did not use room service but looked over the menu - its pricy but it is at most hotels on the strip. Housekeeping didn't come until nearly 4 some days but again, the hotel was full. There is a free tram that will take you to New York, New York and Excalibur so we used that frequently to cut down on walking. Food: The breakfast at Mandalay Bay was excellent. We also ate at StripSteak which was very good as well - its pricy but so is everything else in Vegas. I think it was around $50 for a filet. We got drinks at RumJungle which had a neat atmosphere but it wasn't very busy when we were there. Again be aware that drinks in Vegas are definitely more expensive (we are from MN where mixed drinks run about 4 bucks) so expect to pay anywhere from about $8 and up. We ate at Red, White and Blue for breakfast and dinner once - it was pretty good. Crowded for breakfast. By about day 4 we were getting tired of having to buy every meal and just wanted \"regular food\". Pools: Loved the pools - there is a wave pool, lazy river, hot tubs, and sandy beaches. There was a another area of pools but it was closed while we were there. The pools closed at 7 so no late night hot tub runs. There is a walkway around the pools that was lit up nicely at night but you couldn't go all the way around due to the auto-show. The food by the pool was typical snack bar food. They had waitresses coming around but it was really busy so we only saw them like once an hour but we were fine with walking up to the bar or snack bar. Casino: We didn't gamble a ton but the casino was nice. Our favorite casino was probably Planet Hollywood and Bellagio. The casinos at New York, New York, Excalibur, and Luxor were very dingy and smelled like old smoke. Excursions: We went to Hoover Dam one day which is about an hour outside of Vegas. They have you meet the shuttle bus down by the spa and you wait for other shuttles to drop off people from other hotels so you can all ride the same coach bus. The tour was interesting and we had a good time looking around Hoover Dam. My parents visited Red Rock Canyon when they were there and enjoyed that as well but rented a car to get there. We saw the Beatles Love show at the Mirage and that was excellent. You could get drinks there for 10 dollars that were HUGE. We did a ton of walking so I wore decent shoes but some friends wore cheap flip flops and their feet were killing them by the end of the first day. Overall, we had a great trip and would definitely recommend Mandalay Bay."

Yes, beach, complete with wave machine, in the middle of the desert. A huge variety of bars and restaurants. Of course, a huge casino. We had a room overlooking the strip - a nightmare when you are jetlagged on the first night and cant sleep. I was itching to get out there and could see all razzle and dazzle twinkling whilst my wife snored away. Oh and if you need a snooze in the afternoon be sure to put the do not disturb sign up! The rooms are spacious, well maintained and extremely comfortable. Couldnt fault it. The staff are superb and would open every door for you if they could, but dont be daft, take comfy shoes, as you could be walking for over 5 mins to get to your room. Vegas is a favourite of ours. So much to see and do... the fountains at Ballagio, Coasters at New York New York, Canals at Venetian, shopping, dining, Blue Man Group... but the highlight has to be the Grand Canyon. You MUST MUST do this as you've gone all that way. Anyone who doesnt, has missed the memory of a lifetime."

They also only give wireless if you pay $15.95 per 24 hrs use. There is no complimentary anything, no coffee in the morning or newspaper. If you want breakfast the line at any of the restaurants in the resort is at least 30 mins. and the cost is ridiculous. I will stay at one of the lesser star hotels next time. pay less, have a free breakfast, free internet and oh, yeah, polite customer service."

    "content": "Within the past year and a half, I've stayed at Mandalay Bay 3 times. Two times were during a convention in October that I did not attend but a person I was traveling with did and the other time in August. Mandalay Bay does get crowded but if you are staying there, it should be expected. In the summer, if you want to get a lounger by the pool you need to be out there by 10am at the latest. There are pool boys that will help locate and move loungers for you if you come out after 10 and they do a great job of toweling sweeping to get unoccupied chairs open for others. One bad thing about the pool is the sand and walkways get hot and you cannot walk around without flip flops or something on your feet without burning them, trust me. All 3 rooms I had were clean and housekeeping does an excellent job of cleaning during your stay. There are plenty of places to eat in Mandalay Bay and Manadaly Bay Place or you can take the tram and have a short walk to one of the other casinos. My only complaint is that when adding someone else to your room to be able to do room charges, I was hassled when purchasing snacks twice with the associate indicating I had not been added to the room when after checking with the front desk the assured that I was on there. However, this only happened in October, in the summer they do not check ID/room charges, they just ask for your room number and last night. I defiintely plan on staying at Mandalay Bay on my future trips to Vegas."

Then - the room service was insanely expensive... a bowl of cereal was like $10. Also - the complimentary things they \"gave\" us when we reserved the hotel were BS... and confusing/complicated. Also- the amazing pools are always grossly crowded - and they close at like 7pm... who wants to swim at noon in the Vegas summer heat???? I was so disappointed by that. Also - speaking of being crowded... catching an elevator was like catching a damn crowded subway train - you had to squeeze through throngs of people in the elevator lobby - and then fight and curse to get on. All in all - I would have rathered my friend save some dough - and we could have got a decent room ON STRIP (because this hotel is alllll the way at one end of the strip...)... at the holiday inn, or something and it would have been just as good. Mandalay Bay is most def. overrated and over-priced. Pay for somewhere that actually pampers you and treats you like a person - not a dollar sign."

We also had friends who stayed in the 550dr rooms, all of our rooms were put on the same floor very close together 2 were side by side. Check in was very quick and front desk were very helpful. Nightlife: We checked out the House of Blues Foundation Room. They were offering free cover! It is located on the 43rd floor with an amazing view of the strip. Checked out rum jungle but we were not there for the weekend so missed out on the nights it is open as a night club...it is only a lounge during the week. They were really nice and let us come in and walk around to check it out. Food- We ate at Raffels Cafe, service was great, food good and large portion sizes. We usually would just wonder over to the food court in the luxor for quick eats. It is less than a 10 min walk. Gambling- Well i guess i can't say to much about this I just played the penny slots. I won 170 dollars on the Hot shot frensy games. If you are cheap and like the slots like me try to find these games, i think they were located on the outside by the cashiers. Even if you don't win there seems to be a lot of bonus rounds that keep you going. I played on $5 for a good half our or more a few times! My b/f and his friends played black jack they seemed to enjoy themselves and didn't have any bad comments. Oh and there was always servers around for drinks..I never had a problem getting a drink even playing at penny slots!! All in all the hotel is just beautiful..and we actually ended up going out to the pool one day. I thought it would be to cold for a swim but it was great...and because of the time of year it is pretty quiet and we basically had the pool to our selves!!"

So we decided to take advantage of it. I actually requested (online) one of the larger rooms (750 sq. ft.) because we have a toddler and like to have extra space for him when we travel. We arrived at the hotel around 1:00 PM on a Sunday and our room was ready. However, we were offered the penthouse suite for and extra $50 per day. I have to say, that was the best $150 that I've ever spent. The Penthouse was awesome. I wish that I had taken pictures to post. There was a HUGE living room with two couches, kitchenette with mini bar refrigerator and an empty refrigerator for our food, half bath in the living space, HUGE bedroom with full bath with walk in shower and jacuzzi tub, double sinks, and private toilet room. There were also 4 flat screen televisions located though out the suite, and remote controlled drapes. The best part was probably the turn down service in the evening. Each night, the housekeeping service would come by to pull the comforter down to the foot of the bed, lay out the his and hers matching robe and slippers, and turn the radio on and lights down low. It was wonderful! The Penthouse is located on the 60th floor of the hotel. There are separate elevators to get there that will ONLY go up if you have a room key. Also, the elevator is an express. We never had to wait for it. As soon as you pressed the button, it was ready to go and bypassed all of the other floors. There are some great restaurants located in the hotel and you can walk through the shops/mall that is connected to the hotel to get to the Luxor. There is a lot to do at Mandalay Bay besides gamble. Unfortunately, it was a little too cold for us to use the pool (even though I saw a few people in it) and the beach was closed. This hotel is awesome! The staff was very friendly and helpful. We never had to wait long for any type of service. And the BEST part was that there were NO TIMESHARE SOLICITORS hanging out in the lobby or mall areas. We were hesitant about bringing our 22 month old son to Las Vegas because it is really a city for adults. However, we were able to find some things for him to do that he really enjoyed as well as get in a little gambling in the evenings. I absolutely love the set up of Mandalay Bay and that it is a place for adults and families. Our plan was to stay at each hotel on the strip at least once to figure out which one we liked the best and then make that our regular hotel of choice when visiting Las Vegas. After staying at Mandalay Bay, we really don't need to go to any others. Well......maybe Cesar's Palace so that we can compare the two. But as of right now, our choice is Mandalay Bay. We are already planning our return trip for May."

The bed was comfy and the bathroom was fabulous with a nice jacuzzi tub for two. Our toilet broke one evening at about 2:30 AM and maintence had it fixed by 3 AM. They also gave us a $35 credit for the inconvenience. We did not bring our laptop which was a huge mistake because wireless is free in the room. We paid an arm and a leg to log on in the internet center. We went to see the Lion King which was a FABULOUS show. We also went to see \"O\" at the Bellagio. That was just SPECTACULAR. Amazing show and well worth the price of our tickets. We were kinda off when it came to the time zone change, so our eating schedule was off. We did dine at a really nice restaurant at the Bellagio. We ate at the buffet at the Mandalay which was okay and we did enjoy the House of Blues for appetizers and live entertainment. I can't remember the guys name but he was awesome. We did take a taxi for about $10 to the Outlets which had great prices. We stayed for 4 days which was plenty. Vegas for us is good for the shows and I think a 3-4 day trip is plenty. Check in and Out was smooth. We didn't experience long delays. Nor did we experience issues with the elevetors that some people talk about. The other thing we liked is the fact the Mandalay is at the end of the strip so the hotel didn't get as much foot traffic. We really did enjoy our stay and would stay at the Mandalay again."

    "content": "Assumption: If you're traveling to Vegas in December, you realize that it's not warm and that the beach is closed. We wanted a short getaway that was... 1) Far away from work, but not too far. Since we were traveling with our 4-month-old for the first time and kind of wanted to test his (and our) traveling tolerance 2) Nice. 3) Low-key. We figured we'd probably be sleeping/chilling a lot. 4) Have lots of entertainment/food options. Again, needed to be able to be flexible with the kid. 5) Cheap. We figured we'd be sleeping/resting a lot anyways. And, if my son turned out to hate traveling or get sick, I didn't want to feel like I wasted a lot of money ... and, it turned out great! 1) The 1.5 hour plane flight was great. Just far enough that we could feel we escaped all the pressures of home, but short enough that it didn't push the tolerance of our kid 2) I ended up choosing Mandalay Bay because I knew that even the base rooms were pretty spacious and had nice bathrooms/tubs compared to other hotels. Ended up being a good choice, having to fit the Pack-n-Play into the room, too. 3) It was super low-key. Mandalay Bay was DEAD. Not surprising at all sans beach and being at the south end of the Strip, but this was IDEAL for us. We didn't have to fight through crowds with our stroller. We could stay flexible with our eating schedule (ie fit it around our kid's eating schedule) and not worry about losing reservations. The best part was we could eat at any of the MB restaurants and have plenty of space for our kid. We didn't anticipate that our kid would be so stimulated by all the stuff to look at during the afternoon. This meant that he was overly exhausted by 600pm,and would go totally nuts trying to fall asleep right when we'd be eating dinner. Because business was so slow, it meant we had plenty of room to, reasonably discretely, put him to sleep without being a nuisance to other people. Finally, best of all, I could play $5 blackjack and not get dirty looks from other people when I made novice moves. 4) Turns out we might have been able to take the kid into some shows, but we never bothered trying because he was so exhausted by evening and probably wouldn't have survived a show. 5) There were tons of deals at every hotel we were thinking of, but I chose Mandalay Bay because I knew what kind of room I was getting and because there were so many additional restaurant discounts! The Key Discounts... a) Restaurant.com. You can get $50 (Fleur de Lys, Aureole, Mix, Shanghai Lilly, Strip Steak) or $25 (the rest of their restaurants) certificates for $20/$10. You can get them for even cheaper ($4/$2) via any number of vendors like UPromise.com. The only restriction I didn't realize was that they are for dinner only. I suspect that these discounts will disappear when the weather improves and the beach opens. b) OpenTable.com. Many of the MB restaurants, unlike most other LV resorts, participate in OpenTable which means you can use your certificates here. Other relevant discounts: c) House of Blues 15% (20%?) found in the freebie Vegas tourist booklet d) Miracle Mile shops coupon book. Just show your AAA card at one of the services desks. e) Venetian/Palazzo shops coupon book. I'm kind of forgetting now, but I think the Vegas tourist booklet or one of the tourist magazines in our hotel room had a coupon/flyer that instructs you to bring it to one of the shops that will dispense the coupon book. Kind of weird way to get it, but it was worth it. Overall, we had a great trip with our kid. Clearly, under different circumstances, like if it were just the wife and me, we would have stayed somewhere towards mid-Strip, but for what we were looking for, it worked out great."

We just checked in and I want OUT!!! We were given a room w a broken toilet ( when I say broken I mean in pieces!!!). We asked for another room and we got it. Well, the whole floor where the \"best room\" is has a horrible smell (it reeks). There's a lack of cleanliness I can't even describe (old pretzels under the covers???!!!).

    "content": "We decided to treat ourselves this year and used our casino host to get us a good rate to stay for two weeks in a Vista Suite. The suite itself didn't disappoint and if you get the chance, indulge yourselves. What didn't go down too well was standing on a piece of glass on the first morning because the maid hadn't done her job properly prior to us arriving. As well as a full living area, dining table and bar area, there was a large bedroom with pillow top mattress and a huge bathroom with a sauna / shower. All the drapes, entertainment etc are activated by remote - very swish! The view was great - strip and pool (this was handy because we could suss out how busy it was in the morning!) We were at the Mandalay from the end of August for two weeks which encompassed Labour Day - something we do every year. It was busy as usual and it appears that due to the recession they are lowering their rates to keep the numbers up; unfortunately they have not kept the quantity or quality of staff. A few annoyances; We went to the cafe / ice cream area as you go out to the pool, there were 4 people behind the counter but no one even acknowledged us, when I asked to order I was told to speak to someone else at the end, they ignored me again so we walked off. The centre bar - tried to order to cocktails, ignorant barman looked at me, I asked again, he continued to ignore me, put some lemons in the box and smirked at me, still refusing to serve me. I ended up complaining to his boss, not something I do at generally. Waiting for 30 minutes at the membership rewards counter because there were only two people serving with a line of over 10 waiting. Called the maintenance man as the wind was howling through a hole on one of the windows in the suite. He came and looked at it and then said \"nothing that he can do and it's not unsafe\" - thanks for that, very comforting when you're 32 floors up! The tram between the Mandalay and the Excalibur / Luxor was closed early on a number of occasions, including Labour Day - what's that all about? Are customers turning into an inconvenience?! Ah well it's a free service so that's probably why, but it does increase traffic between the hotels - or so you'd think. The pool was great as ever and we indulged ourselves even further by renting a bungalow for a couple of days - relaxation with a private pool away from all the hub bub, well worth the money. The casino itself has never been one of our favourites as we always think it's rather soulless and this time seemed even more so. They were doing some building where the ever present Wheels used to be and the atmosphere very lacking. Perhaps it's just us losing our enthusiasm for the property as a whole. The Noodle Shop was as good as ever and Red White & Blue do a much better breakfast than Raffles. The Buffet was good and a sign of the times means that you can pay for all day tickets now, not something we've ever seen before this year. Also, Raffles was actually closed for about 2 days which meant that there was no 24 hour restaurant for a couple of days, nothing major, but going against the whole premise of 24 hr options that Vegas offers. The menu at Raffles has been reduced immensely, not necessarily a good thing either. Stripsteak was as outstanding as ever though, the service, the food and the whole experience, worth every penny. All this aside we did have a great time as always in Vegas, we saw Nickelback at the MGM and Puddle of Mudd at the Hard Rock as well as doing the usual sort of stuff but this time around with the exception of paying for a great suite and the pool, the Mandalay Bay and its staff didn't add anything positive this time around. We have been to THEHotel and Mandalay Bay about 6 times in the past 4 years but we have now decided to give it a wide berth. Time to try somewhere else. A real shame."

The only problem we found with the Mandalay was that it was too far away from the rest of the strip. They have a monorail running from the Exaliber / NYNY to the Mandalay but it ended at 10:30 pm. So if you went to a show down the strip you ended up having to either walk back from New York New York or taking a taxi - using the regular monorail from the strip ends you at the MGM. Its a long walk especially if your partner is wearing high heels. If you go down to the strip it is a pain to return to your room to change clothes to go back out to the strip for a show or dinner. By the way I would recomment seeing Jersey Boys - great show. Also saw Terry Fator and would also recommend his show."

    "content": "Stayed this past Friday and Saturday night after Christmas. Checked in fairly late, so there was no wait at all at registration. The lobby is a little bit of a walk through the casino from the parking lot. The location of Mandalay Bay is at the south end of the Strip, so you have a decent walk to any of the other casinos. It is also the closest to the airport, so catching a flight is very easy. The rooms are alright, and very average at this point compared to most other MGM properties. I would say the rooms at the Mirage are nicer, along with Aria (see my other review) and the Venetian and Wynn. The casino floor hasn\u2019t changed much at all in the past few years and could use a refresh. The bathroom is extremely large and has more than enough space to accommodate your needs. I did like the TV in the bathroom so I could watch/listen to the news as I was getting ready. I don\u2019t like the peekaboo window that is appearing in many hotels. If I wanted someone to see me in the bathroom, I would just invite them in. The pool area at Mandalay is probably one of the best on the Strip, so if swimming or soaking some rays is high on your priority list, make sure to come to Mandalay Bay. The restaurant selection is find with both decent casual and fine dining selections, though there are better restaurants on the Strip. If you can get a good deal, it is worth staying here. If you have to pay full price, try to find an alternative."

    "content": "My husband and I stayed at Mandalay Bay from Dec25-Dec29. The hotel itself is very beautiful and kept very clean. It even smells MUCH nicer compared to the other hotels I visited. Staff was..good not spectacular.. nothing special. Housekeeping was a little intruding.. we did not have a \"do not disturb sign\" so at 8:30am they knocked once at the door.. did not wait for a response, then they let themselves in. We ran to the front of the room where they were standing, and told them we were not ready for them to come in. They made a big deal about it because we had not posted the 'do not disturb' sign on the door handle. We explained we did not have one, and they rudely gave us one. Our first night we stayed in a connecting room on the 11th floor. The room was nice and clean.. we did not find stains, hair or trash in the room. The bathroom was pretty clean except for a room key holder and an ear swab i found on the bathroom floor under the sink. The view was not of the strip but I didnt really mind. Well, this being a connecting room (to people we didnt know) we heard A LOT of noise from their crying baby and requested a room change. Staff questioned why we wanted to move, but they handled the request without much hassle. Our next room was on the 34th floor.The room was identical as the previous one with the exception of the connecting room, a chair, and a chandelier in the bathroom. This room had a view of the strip which was AMAZING! The noise level was.. different.. we now heard sirens and our other neighbors. So if you are a light sleeper, you may want to request a corner room. When it comes to the location of the hotel, know that it is the last hotel on the strip. The walk is not too bad but its not something you want to do everyday. Mandalay Bay has a complimentary tram that will take you directly to Luxor and Excalibur. (not open 24 hours) You can also walk to Luxor from the inside of the hotel through Mandalay Place. (strip of shops and restaurants) The front lobby is tricky to reach from the strip, so i recommend that if you are walking back to Mandalay Bay, that you enter through Luxor. When it comes to food, you have many choices of restaurants and bar not only in the hotel itself, but also in Mandalay Place and the restaurants in Luxor. (Luxor has Mc Donalds, Little Caesars, Nathans etc.) For all the coffee drinkers, Mandalay bay has 2 Starbucks locations!!! I also recommend buying a drink at this place called Evening Call. You can find really tasty alcoholic beverages there. So besides those few little things, we had a great time at Mandalay Bay. Again the hotel and room were pretty clean, casino was very nice, location not too bad if you dont mind the walking. Plenty of restaurants and drink options."

No room amenities such as coffee maker and personal refrigerator. But we got charged $15 for wifi and the hotel charged $30 to visit the gym. Outrageous! I also thought the location is inconvenient to the strip--you will need to take the tram to excalibur to get closer to the action. On our last day, they filled up all the pools for the NYE weekend, which meant a very luke warm shower!! disappointing."

The scent is not overwhelming like the scent used at Venetian or Pallazzoo. Checked in around 9 am. I asked for a king non-smoking and got double non-smoking but I was alright with that since I was by myself. The room is decorated very nicely with good pillows and I slept well each night. There is a telephone and a tv in the bathroom as well as a seperate shower and deep tub. Loved the tub! Dual sinks with nice amenities that were replenished each day. The room had 2 large closets and one of them had a safe. Flat screen TV, desk and a nice view. Each bed had a nightlite at the top it of it. The hotel and casino is very attractive. The casino is built in a square so it was extremely easy to navigate. Just start at one end and walk the square until you found what you were looking for. There were no fast food options which is one of the only 2 cons I found. The other con is that the dealers spent a lot of time talking about how they weren't getting enough tips which I personally found distasteful. There is a tram that runs from Mandalay to Luxor and Excalibur but it was down about 50% of the time that I was there. When that happens, you have to walk to Mandalay Place and connect through Luxor that way."

One thing great about Mandalay is the pool which is in my opinion the best in Vegas with roundabout lazy river and a scene you simply can\u2019t beat. Unless you want to be surrounded by tools don\u2019t go up to the area you have to pay to get in as the pool itself is as good as it gets. As far as staying within the property I would recommend throwing down the few extra dollars and staying at The Hotel which I thoroughly enjoyed."

The floor to ceiling windows that cover the entire side of the suite looked out over the stip and provided a truly amazing view. We were able to connect the ipod to the awesome sound system in the room so the music was great. The dining and bar area were perfect for entertaining and sitting area provided a great place to dance and chat. The space was absolutely perfect for our event. The employees of the hotel were friendly and helpful. The dealers in the casino were the friendliest I've encountered in Vegas (we still lost, though). We spent some time one evening in the large lounge area next to the casino. That evening an awesome band played. We had a table full of musicians and everybody enjoyed the evening. Drink service was great as well. There were only a couple of areas of concern. The valet service is a bit slow, friendly, but still slow. Also, I didn't feel the room was as clean as it should have been when we first arrived. We had to call housekeeping to re-clean the sinks and jet tub in the master bathroom. Housekeeping was apologetic and did a fine job after the call. Also, while it didn't affect us, the power went out between 1am and 6am for \"regular maintenance\" or some such thing. This information was not provided to us ahead of time, but rather left in a letter in our room the day of the outage. Again, it didn't affect us in any way, but could have been a huge inconvenience if we hadn't been too tired to stay up past 1am! Overall, I would highly recommend the Mandalay Bay. It is understated and elegant. It is not over stimulating (i.e. New York, New York) and provides a more relaxed atmosophere. The Vista Suite is a superb value for a gathering and will definitely impress your guests."

The furnishings are very nice although I find the color palette a bit strange. Guest bathrooms are very large with a nice big soaking tub. There are a number of excellent dining options including Aureole, Fleur de Lys, and Strip Steak. The property is really easy to get around. The pool area has all of the bells and whistles that once would expect, but it gets really crowded. Service is generally good although it's a bit spotty on the floor and at the pool. Strangely, I like this hotel very much, but I prefer both Four Seasons and The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. A good South Strip choice."

Not sure where others stayed when they complained of noise because I didn't hear a peep. Which is unusual, maybe those other guests were in a standard room. The beds are so soft and comfortable, it makes it hard to get up. Room service is pricey but our suite had a table so we had breakfast set up for us, especially nice with the view. Your other option is to get dressed and go downstairs and find breakfast. DO yourself a favor and upgrade, either beg, ask, or comp, you won't regret the larger space for the view, quietness and luxury feeling. Eyecandy was noisy but it is what we expected, nice cocktails. Even though MB is large you just feel comfortable there. The plumeria smell and nice colors/decor don't feel dated or over the top. Biggest wish, is to be smoke free, like Aria. Skip any buffet here. Red, White and Blue does sandwiches to go. Highest recommendation of a resort."

    "content": "I stayed at the Mandalay Bay on business recently for a conference. Although I have visited Las Vegas many times, this was my first stay at MB, and I would definitley go back. I was a given a very nice room upgrade and was located on the 29th floor with a direct view down the strip. The room was very spacious, with a large flat screen tv mounted on the wall and an oversized bathroom with doubles sinks, separate bath tub, glass shower and closed off toilet area. There was also a mounted LCD TV in the bathroom. 2 large closets were also available as well as a large full length mirror. If I had one complaint about the room, it would be that the mirror was down the hallway and didn't have the best lighting, but aside from that, it was very comfortable. As I was there for work, I do have to add that the convention center, although connected to the hotel, was a hike from the hotel rooms and casino, so be prepared to walk (but I guess that is the norm in vegas). I used the fitness center twice during my stay. They had a great facility with lots of cardio machines and equipment and it was never crowded. They also provided free water, towels and fruit, which was nice. (but on the downside, they did charge $20 fee for the use of the gym each day). The SPA - oh the spa was amazing and I could have spent ALL day lounging around the jacuzzi area. They had 3 varying temperatures hot, Luke warm and cold which was perfect for plunging in and out of them. They also has a large sauna and steam room, many comfy lounge chairs, a quiet room and a tv lounge area, all the while you are lounging in plush robes and the typical spa shoes. The lockers rooms were very nice with clean shower areas and a large dressing area with hairdryers, toiletry products etc. I spent about 4 hours there - wonderful!"

    "content": "I stayed at Mandalay Bay on Friday and Saturday 12/11-12/13. My fiance was there for business and I flew in to stay with him. I really enjoyed the ambience of the hotel and casino. It is very large so there are lots of choices for food and drinks, ranging from a small deli to upscale restaurants. The gambling is good, lots of slots and tables to choose from. If you're looking for cheaper gambling you might want to go elsewhere. The table minimums were $25 at night (craps was $10). We had a standard king room with a view of the strip. The bed was comfortable and I really liked the shower and water pressure. My one complaint is that we heard lots of noises in our room. We could hear people talking in the hallway and room noises from upstairs and next door. So I'm not sure if the insulation is thin but noises from above woke me up Saturday morning, and I am not usually bothered by noises at other hotels. I don't know how much our room rate was as his company paid for it. We ordered breakfast room service on Saturday which was decent. Room service prices are skyhigh, but that is expected. During the day on Saturday it was cold and rainy so we stayed inside, but fortunately you can walk over to the Luxor through Mandalay Bay without having to go outside. On Saturday night we went to dinner at Trattoria Del Lupo inside Mandalay Bay. I had one of the best pasta dishes I've ever tasted! I can't remember the name but it was a thick homemade pasta with a sausage based bolognese sauce. We also ordered the caprese salad which was just okay. The olive oil and balsamic were great but the tomatoes weren't anything special, especially for the price we paid. There is also an extensive wine list. I would definitely recommend this restaurant! The pool was closed for the season so I never even saw it. But I've always heard it's the best pool in Vegas. Overall, I would stay here again and recommend the hotel to others, especially if you have the money to spend. I enjoyed everything about the hotel except the noise issues we had in our room."

    "content": "I'm certain the Mandalay Bay must be in the top 20 largest hotels in the USA if not the world. As a Las Vegas resident for almost 34 years I've seen it all. Easily, I've \"staycationed\" at least 20 to 30 different properties in Las Vegas. Also, during the 80's and 90's spent a great deal of my life living out of a suitcase from Concord, New Hampshire to Honolulu, Hawai'i, London, Paris, Puerto Rico, etc. I know hotels... anyways... The past few weeks I've stayed at the Mandalay Bay and have enjoyed almost every minute. The lobby is huge and beautiful. The front desk staff most courteous and informative. The elevators are close and quick. The rooms are large, clean and surprisingly cozy. Floor to ceiling windows are a plus - and if above the 17th floor - most have a super view. The bathrooms have a \"spa tub,\" which is larger than the average tub and quite comfortable. Another plus is the small color TV in the bathroom. A separate and large shower is another plus. The \"water closet\" (toilet) has it's own phone. The beds are super comfortable. The king-size bed rooms have a rather unique couch arrangement that accompanies the work station desk: very comfortable and cozy. The two-bed queens do not offer this unique arrangement, which is a shame. The \"cozy\" feel to this hotel, which is in reality - huge (3000 rooms plus?) is the surrounding feeling of luxury. It is everywhere - even in the casino, restaurants, bars and the numerous \"signature\" eateries. Getting \"lost\" inside the Mandalay Bay is more of an adventure than an inconveinance. However, not every minute is welcome and/or adventure filled. Their service \"factor\" is somewhat lacking. During one stay (a two-nighter) my spa tub overflowed as the upper catch drain was blocked. The bath floor was flooded and my custom slippers ruined from the water. Maintenance called twice before they arrived to find \"nothing wrong.\" I was offered another room by the front desk. An upgrade to a bizzare mini-suite where the king-sized bed blocked the windows, hence the view. The mini-suite also boasted a square couch - much like an oversized ottoman - and totally uncomfortable. The curtains were \"fixed\" and unable to close. I was moved again to a regular king. Believe it or not - the next night the spa tub overflowed again as the faucet leaked. Management comped one night of my stay - so I guess it was an even match. Even with all of that adventure of the bizzare tubs - I look forward to my next stay at the Mandalay Bay. While the rates are pricey - especially if you are on total turist mode and plan only to sleep and shower inbetween trips into the green felt jungles - Mandalay is worth it. In fact, they offer very low rates currently as Las Vegas slowly (very slowly) emerges from the depression. Sunday thru Thursday rates can be 50% discounted."

    "content": "I've stayed twice before at Mandalay Bay and thought I'd return after years away. After an odd reception experience where the hostess asked us if we knew about the Joe Perry Project (lead guitarist of Aerosmith, I did not know this at the time). When I said no she said, \"Oh, I was going to give you free tickets to his show, but if you don't know him you wouldn't get it.\" Umm... thanks? Spent Thanksgiving in Vegas and was looking forward to a very good meal at Aureole (the fancy Mandalay Bay restaurant with the 'wine angels'). Let's just say that it was very overpriced and not really good at all. I guess third tier chefs were working on the holiday? (Had a much better meal a few days later at StripSteak) The wave pool was closed for the season and the guests who wanted a pool experience were cordoned off to two small pools. When we walked through to get our bearings of the property, it felt like we were at a Motel 6. Lots of people crowded around these tiny pools. No separation between kids and families and any type of adult pool. No relaxation in the pool area on this trip. I had forgotten how far Mandalay was from the rest of the Strip. Things had changed since I had stayed there last. Our only transportation option aside from cabs was to tram it over to Excalibur, then cross over toward the Tropicana - cross again to MGM and walk all of the way back through the casino to reach the monorail. The monorail is efficient and affordable, but it takes forever to walk through all of the casinos to get where you're going. And Wynn has discontinued their free shuttle so - to reach it we had to walk through Harrah's, past all of the, let's call it \"street theatre\", past the Ventian and Palazzo, and finally to Wynn. I think next time I'd rather revisit Paris and have equal access to either end of the strip."

    "content": "Mandalay Bay is a beautiful property and extremely well-maintained. It is clean, the \"standard\" rooms are large and well appointed and we found the employees friendly and the service excellent. For us there was one drawback but for those who like the European-style soft pillow top mattresses and bedding, you'll be very happy with the beds. We prefer a firm old-style hotel mattress with more back support. They have none and the bed boards they can provide are thin and do not help. Let me just provide some thoughts on several subjects: We ate at Fleur de Lys, Aureole, Rick Moonen's RM Seafood and the Border Grill, along with one brunch in the buffet and one lunch in the buffet. The first 3 restaurants have outstanding well known chefs behind them. In the case of Rick Moonen, he lives in Vegas and is on-site often. We thought Fleur de Lys was absolutely outstanding and would rate Rick Moonen's #2 out of the first 3 high-end gourmet restaurants. They are expensive but worth it. The Border Grill is an excellent Mexican restaurant where you can actually get some healthy Mexican items. Try the turkey Tostada, for instance, which is delicious and very healthy if you don't eat the shell. The portions are big and we gound both things we got were excellent. We did not think the buffet was that great, especially when you consider the price is much higher than say the Mirage or Treasure Island. We found many of the items on the buffet prepared in such a manner that they deteriorated fairly quickly when sitting out on a buffet. Some of the items, like the flank steak for instance, were just not top quality. I'd try somewhere else. If you want to save on one meal during the day a good alternative is a food court that is located on a walkway between Mandalay Bay and the Luxor and Excalibar Casinos. They have several franchise operations in there including Quiznos Subs and they are normal franchise prices. Just go to the back of the Casino and upstairs to Mandalay Place and you'll find the walkway there. Many comment on the location of Mandalay Bay but we did not find that a negative. It seems much quieter on weekends (althought it is obviously busy) and is not the \"zoo\" like I'd consider the Mirage, for instance. There is also a free tram between Mandalay Bay and Luxor, Excalibar and MGM and it just runs back and forth so you don't have to wait too long for one. Once you get off at the MGM you are near the center of the strip and you have less than a mile walk to the Mirage which you would consider close to the end of the main strip hotels. The only significant negative for us to Vegas is the fact they are way behind the curve in terms of smoking regulations. They still permit smoking in casinos and sportsbooks. During the week when it's not too busy it is not bad but on weekends when the casinos are particularly busy there is a smell of smoke everywhere you go. You can't escape it and you can't sit down at a game in the casino or in the sportsbook without the probability of a smoker sitting down near you and making it worse. There are no \"no smoking\" areas in the casino and that is a big drawback for us...in fact, it is such a drawback we may not return until Vegas finally leaps into the 20th century and bans smoking in the casinos."

They also treated my best friend with the same indifference when she tried to order and pay for a bottle of Champayne to go to our room. On the day of the wedding, I went to the Spa to have my makeup done, only to be told, 'we dont do bridal make-up at the hotel'. Faced with having to do my own make-up on my 'most important day of my life', I went to the Hair Salon to get my hair done anyway. While there they offered me their Birdal Make-up service. Surely the Spa staff knew that the Salon does this so why not tell me? The Salon staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. On check-out we asked for the use of a day room, only to be told they did not do that and we were expected to pay another $30 each for the use of the Spa for the day, with receptionist telling us 'No hotel she stays at has a day room'. This is the first hotel I have ever stayed at that does not offer you use of a day room."

Room - There were a few stains on the carpet and sofa (nothing that a good shampoo would not fix) and a few scratches on some of the furniture but that is to be expected as time passes. Everything in the room was in working order. The room was clean when we arrived. We did not use the maid service during our stay, so I cannot comment on that. Food - We only ate at the Burger Bar while here, which is the norm for us, and the food was great as always. Casino - We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night (Saturday night was a large concert date) and it was rather crowded, but drink service seemed pretty good when compared to other places we visited on the strip. The casino was clean and well-ventilated. If given the same option of staying in a suite for free I would probably stay here again because I do like this hotel.

Check in was fast and easy; it was a Monday, so there were no weekend crowds. Check-out was also easy, but there were longer lines because it was a Friday, and because of the UFC championship event taking place the following day. Express check-out is available in the roon on the TV, but you must use a credit card. We used a credit card at check-in, but actually paid cash via a debit card at check-out, so we had to use the desk. Service was friendly and informative. Bell service was also fast, friendly and very helpful. The bellman called housekeeping for us to take care of: 1. More pillows 2. Mildew in the shower stall (should have been taken care of by regular maintenance) 3. Door to toilet stall had to be rehinged. These items were accomplished quickly. The room was large, as was the bathroom. Overall, it was clean and kept that way. The reading lights over the beds didn't work and the engineer couldn't fix them. There were no instructions or price list with the mini-bar (although we asked for one), so be very careful. It's expensive, as mini-bars always are. BUT: it's got sensors, so if you pick something up or take something out of the fridge, it will be charged to your room within 30 seconds. Food at the hotel is terrific! We ate at Lupo, StripSteak, Raffles, China Grill & had room service, and all were excellent. Mix: this premier restaurant is located at the top of THEHotel and is extremely pricey. the only bad experience we had was here. We had a drink to check out the view. As soon as we saw the host stand and as we walked through the restaurant to the bar, there were at least six men in dark suits who had nothing to do with food prep or service. They eyed us suspiciously. Seems they were bouncers. Music in the bar was blasting (and could be heard in the dining room). We ordered two drinks, then went out onto the terrace to check out the much-ballyhooed view. When we came back to the bar, half my drink was gone. The stem of the glass was sticky. Next to my glass was $3 cash - not ours, we charged the drinks to our room. Obviously, someone had drunk from my glass. The bartender was skeptical, but once he felt the sticky glass and saw the money, he made me a fresh drink. I'm glad I pressed the point; the cabbie taking us to the airport told us there's a serious problem of \"date rape\" drugs in drinks, so make sure you keep yours in your hand at all times. The casino was clean, plenty of machines & tables, good drink service. Grounds are lush and lovely. The beach is amazing. We saw The Lion King and it was wonderful. The ticket agent was very helpful; I have knee problems and she suggested the ADA seats, which were perfect. Overall, a good experience, and I recommend this hotel and would stay there again. It's at the end of the strip though. If you're looking to be in the thick of things, it's not."

    "content": "From what was an appalling start at check-in we actually finished up really liking this hotel and would absolutely recommend it. We have 2 children and without a doubt it's the best Vegas strip hotel for them - if you have them don't hesitate, stay here! BUT even without them I would still stay here - It's not overrun with children. (Vegas maybe isn't the best place for children but what an experience for them!) THE GOOD..... Rooms: Fantastic, clean, quiet (some of the best in Vegas $ for $) - Moved to strip-view next day following check-in nightmare - Strip view well worth it - Bathroom huge, beds comfortable - Beware snack tray - move it and you pay for it (only noticed charge when back home but accounts refunded charge no problem even though several days later, thanks!) Food: Great and all generally in same area - Bayside Buffet - large choice, high quality, good service, windows so could see outside (unusual for Vegas) - Raffles - great food and great friendly service - Red - no windows to the outside world but again food great, best service Pool: Great - Lazy river - hilarious! Take your own tubes to save $'s, they inflate for free at the tube rental kiosk - Wave pool - fun, could handle the odd rules about where you could and couldn't stand but watch the white 'putty' they use in pool base as it gets on your swim wear - Attendants (apart from lazy river kiosk) VERY unfriendly and unwelcoming, they need to smile - When to go - in the last 2 hours of the day, half empty Casino: Good - Unusually for Vegas, easy to find way around - Minimal smoke - Comp drinks provided quickly and with a smile Parking: Valet great and free - Phone ahead then your car will be ready when you get down and you get a bottle of water for free (nice touch in the heat) Location: Great - With children it was perfect - If you take a cab ask for the 'quick' way, i.e. NOT down the strip ($10 - $12 cab fare to Paris for example) - If you do have children using cabs is a good way to avoid the 'card flickers' on some parts of the strip Elevators: mostly fine - If the conference has kicked out, forget it and use the service elevators! Otherwise, never an issue Lost wallet: Hotel reaction very good - One of our party lost their wallet, another guest found it and handed it in - Traumatic experience but honesty of guest and hotel service outstanding. Thank you! THE BAD..... Check-in: Don't expect to get what you have booked - Despite confirming by phone twice the strip view room with 2 doubles we had booked was not available. The reason - Mandalay Bay subsequently took a conference booking so they gave all the doubles to the conference! - Check-in manager not bothered and couldn't care less, suggested one of the children could sleep on the floor or have 3 in a king bed! It was quite clear that if there's a conference you don't count. We were one of several with the same issue."

This view was not available when we checked in (we didn't arrive until 8pm) so they put us in a room in the back (still a nice view, but not the strip) and gave us this room at 10am the next morning. Very accomodating for everything we asked about, and I would definitely stay here again. Great bathroom! The pool area was very nice, the gym/spa was excellent. 5PM was they only time I saw the elevators busy, but the line moved quickly. Loved the breakfast at the House of Blues (use the BOGO coupon in the LV book at the front desk) but I did not care for the RumJungle for dinner (we got that all-u-can-eat meat buffet). The location is away from the main part of the strip, so it takes about $15 cab ride or 45 minutes on the public bus to get down to the busy part of the strip, but the hotel is so nice, it's worth it."

For runners there is a \u00bc mile loop around the pool facilities but it does get a bit boring doing loops. I enjoyed going for my morning runs up and down the strip instead for a change of scenery plus you get an extra workout running up and down the stairs to cross over some the streets. There are lots of runners out in the mornings on the strip. Room was lovely and large. We were on the 25th floor facing the strip. Could lie in bed and look out the window right down the strip. Beds were to die for! Pillow top with an extra feather bed (or polyfill) and the most incredible soft sheets. We found the rooms pretty quiet as the large bathroom separated the hallway from the sleeping area. No coffee maker in the room which I gather is typical of strip hotels. Large soaker tub with a separate shower that had a pebble floor and double sinks. TV in the bathroom was situated to allow you to watch TV while soaking in the tub. Bath towels were old and not very fluffy. Tip: Best deal was the two for one breakfast coupon that I found in one of the Vegas magazines for House of Blues. The little books (I believe called 24/7) are everywhere even in the back of taxis. Breakfasts were good and can\u2019t beat the price of $20 for 2 breakfasts, two coffees and tip."

    "content": "Vegas isn't exactly a place for children, and I realize that, but my daughter loves The Lion King, so I decided to take her on this trip solely for the purpose of seeing the show since a NYC broadway trip was out of our budget. I heard the show at Mandalay was just as great, and proved to be right. The show was great although my seat was broken and reclined further than the rest of the seats in the row, so I had to sit on the edge of my chair for the first half of the show. I switched seats after intermission, and my daughter sat on my lap, and it was much more comfortable. As for the hotel, the Mandalay Bay is a beautiful resort! Wonderful pools (although a bit chilly during our visit due to the season). Buffet was decent although nothing to remember. The Wynn buffet is the best if you are seeking a worthwhile buffet. Now for the disappointment. It seems as though the hotel was understaffed or the staff just decided to cut corners. On our second day, I noticed after returning to our room in the early evening that it had not been cleaned, so I had to call housekeeping. We were leaving for dinner, and noticed that the room had been cleaned promptly upon our return. No problem. Then on the third day, I noticed after a day out at the premium outlets, that they had cleaned the room, or so I suspected since the beds were made. I didn't pay much attention. We went to the evening show of The Lion King, and returned to our room around 10 PM. As usual, I always place towels that I wish to have replaced on the bathroom floor in a pile to indicate to housekeeping that we need to have them replaced. As we were getting ready for bed and washing up, I pulled a towel which I thought was new since it was freshly rolled and placed in the shelf between the double vanities, and noticed that it had black mascara stain on it. I was appalled when I realized that this was the same towel I had used from yesterday! After I dried my face off with it from the night before, I noticed that it had mascara on it because I had not thoroughly removed my mascara. So I placed the hand towel along with our bath towels on the floor. I started to examine the other towels. I also recognized hot chocolate stain on one of the other towels that I used to clean up a spill that my daughter made. I examined the bedding. The night before my daughter spilled hot chocolate on the corner of the sheets. It was still there. It was obvious to me that housekeeping picked up the towels that I left on the floor and instead of replacing them, they folded them and rolled the handtowels and placed them back in the bathroom. Ugh! It made me wonder what else they had not actually cleaned. I immediately called the front desk and was transferred to speak to the manager. They promptly sent housekeeping up late in the evening to clean the room and replace the towels. The housekeeping staff sent to tend to the matter was sympathetic and apologetic. The manager assured me that they would investigate the matter. However, I never heard from any of the staff or the manager during the rest of my stay. Needless to say, I never expected to experience this type of problem from a resort with such merit and reputation. This was my first stay at the Mandalay, and I left sorely disappointed."

Fantastic stuff. Also if you get a chance do the helicopter trip from Vegas to the Grand Canyon, do it, it is absolutely terrific. Avoid the porn sellers on the street by taking the tour bus which is interesting, and it seemed to me the food in Las Vegas was not good, irresspective of how much you paid."

The pool area is definitely worth the hype, but get out there early, and the weekends are just crazy. The lazy river is a blast. The 'overflow' pool off one of the parking lots is actually nice too for crowd reasons, but it's off the main drag. The location of the hotel makes you feel kindof isolated from the rest of the strip. We over went as far as Caesar's and that was only for one of the nights there. The rooms are decent, but I've stayed in other large Vegas hotels and the noise off the hallways is not that well filtered. Also, there need to be more elevators. We were on a higher floor, so not as impacted..but there would be times when we would stop at floors going down and people could not get on because the elevator was already packed."

    "content": "This was my first time to Vegas and same with my husband. We tried to do a lot of the attractions and were drop dead tired by the end. I always apoligize ahead of time for the length of my posts. I know I appreciate details, so I usually try to give them. Arrival: We used a shuttle from the airport and were dropped off on the lower level (beach) of the hotel. It's a quick ride up the elevator or escalators to the main hallways where reception is. General Layout: The hotel can be a little confusing in it's layout, but after wandering in some of the other strip hotel complexes, this is not unique. They do provide you with a map and it was useful especially in the beginning. Check-In: This was a breeze! We arrived at the hotel mid-morning and checked right into our room without any hassle or problems. Room: We were in what I assume are the lowest level of rooms (550; Room 28-208) because we booked through Southwest Vacations, but our room was lovely! It is a decent size room with a king bed, couch/chair, table, nightstands, and dresser. Nice features in the room include an Ipod docking station/alarm clock and large flat screen TV. The bathroom is good sized with separate shower and bathtub. There are 2 sinks, nice bath products, and a small flat-screen TV. The toilet is in a separate room/closet and has a phone although we did not use it! They do have one of the mini-bars where if you move something, you'll get charged so just beware. We avoided it at all costs and had no problems. There are a lot of TV channels and looks like a number of pay-per-view options, but we weren't in the room much to use them. Very clean! Much nicer than I expected. Casino: Most of the strip casinos seem the same to me, as I'm not a big gambler. Lots of lights and noise. Didn't seem to smoky and I'm a non-smoker. Waitresses in the casino seemed to be on top of things, but not necessarily the friendliest. Pools: We only went to the beach/pools one day and spend most of our time in the lazy river. Very clean and relaxing. We did go early in the morning when they opened and had no problem getting a chair where we wanted, but did fill up relatively quickly as far as the better seats/locations. There are numerous pool areas, but the lazy river and wave pool seemed the most crowded. They do have tubes available for sale. Restaurants: There are numerous choices for restaurants, although we only ate breakfast at our hotel. We ate at Raffles two days. Their specialty items are yummy and large portions. Try the daily lemonades as they are delicious! The rest of the menu looked intriguing as well. The third day we ate at the coffee bar on the lower level. Wasn't too impressed there - no bagels and the danish were kind of stale. That was very overpriced for what you got. Check-Out: If you wait till the check-out time, like we did, you will have a wait. And then there was another fairly lengthy wait to have our bags held, as we did not fly out of Vegas until that evening. Just be prepared time-wise. Aquarium: We did visit the aquarium at Mandalay Bay. We are from Omaha where our zoo is one of the top in the nation, including our aquarium, so it was interesting, but perhaps not as intriguing to us as to other guests. And it too is pretty pricey. Free Monorail: There is a free monorail that runs from Mandalay Bay to Excaliber. This saves you a fair amount of walking and gets you to one of the major corners on the strip. Beware that it does close at midnight (until 6am?). Business Center: They do have a business center which is more like a closet with a couple of computers and printers in it. And of course you pay to use them. We had to in order to print out boarding passes. I think there's WiFi in the rooms for an extra charge, but don't quote me! Misc. Las Vegas Tips: Carry lots of one dollar bills with you so you can tip the waitresses who get you the free drinks. I know people who don't, but a $1 drink is still a lot cheaper than a $7 one in the bars. Wear comfortable shoes because you'll do a lot of walking. Save the cute ones for the shows only. We did two buffets - Bellagio (good, but I don't like seafood so a lot of the stuff was wasted on me) and Paris (I loved this one especially for the French inspired items like crepes, creme brulee, etc.) Pick a show despite the cost - we saw Blue Man Group and it was amazing!! Hoover Dam (we did an express tour - about 4.5 hours long) is worth seeing once in your life! It's been over a month since we were there so many of my details have been forgotten, but feel free to contact me if you want any more specific info!"

The service was excellent, friendly cocktail waitresses, bartenders, front desk , valet, bellstaff, and housekeeping. We had a standard 2 queen bed room, that had an excellent view of the mountains through a floor-to-celing window. The beds were super plush with nice bedding. There were two flat screen TVs (bedroom/bathroom), a shower, seperate bathtub and double sinks. Simple and very comfortable, I loved this room! The pool area was nice, but I had heard so much hype, it wasn't quite what I expected. The \"beach\" was PACKED with lounge chairs (that filled up quickly) and no shade, with a \"wave pool\" that did one wave every ten minutes or so (pretty lame). We did find a place to lay by one of the lagoon pools every day, which was much more relaxing, a better atmosphere, and the poolside service was very attentive. The sportsbook was packed on Sunday for football, and after searching several bars within the casino I finally found one TV that had the Seahawks on it (the Steelers, Packers, and Patriots were all playing at the same time). Although I think I was the only person in the hotel that wanted to watch the Seahawks, the bartender kept the channel on for me even with requests from other guests to change it (keep in mind this was one of about 100 TVs in the casino), I really appreciate service like that. We kept it simple on food, Burger Bar sliders are the best! Went to see \"O\" at the Bellagio, liked Ka better (more info at seperate reviews). Overall, Mandalay Bay is one of the best hotels I've stayed at in Vegas because of it's service, which at this point of all my Vegas adventures is what I find to be the dealbreaker of where I'll stay, and where I will never return."

    "content": "Mandalay Bay is one of the newer mega hotels on the Las Vegas Strip. This is mainly a plus. Check-in was efficient, friendly and helpful. with the slight concern that the check-in clerk did not inform us that we were being given rooms with two queens rather than one king, as we had booked. We were offered a change later on in the day but decided to stay put. The rooms were well-appointed, large and had especially nice bathrooms, with seperate shower stall and his and hers washhandbasins. There was a large flat screen television, a desk area and two telephones. In my experience the rooms at the Mandalay Bay are above average for hotels on the Strip. We got a very low rate, which probably explains why we were on a lower floor, with no view to speak of. The hotel had a couple of Starbucks and the usual variety of expensive restaurants on the premises. The sun bathing area is designed like a beach, so there is sand where you normally get concrete, and a large number of lungers, which were not too close together. Instead of a swimming pool there is an enormouse wave pool, which generates very gentle waves every 90 seconds. The Mandalay Bay is at the very south of the Strip, its the first property that you encounter coming from the interstate. There is a monrail that takes guests to the Luxor and the Excalibur, but it is a mile or so from the centre of the Strip, so be prepared for numerous taxi rides. All in all the plusses outweigh this minus, and if you get a good rate the Mandalay Bay is a great choise for your stay in Las Vegas. Highly recommended."

I really did enjoy our stay, although in the future i will be looking to stay more central on the Strip. It really was a mission to get anywhere as you are literally on the end of the strip, The restaurants were not to good either and very expensive. The beach is great, only you cant actually swim in the water as they have wave machines. The life guards are constantly calling people to stand behind certain lines for safety reasons - i didnt like this part to much as it was very very hot! A dip and swim without being constantly whistled at would of suited me much more. Check in/ Check out and the information stand staff were polite and helpful. It really depends what you are looking for, overall i enjoyed my stay but found the hotel a little boring and out of the way. I prefered the hotels further in that had alot more going on and alot more choice of food options. Also i wouldnt bother with the aqaurium, it was very dirty and the reptiles especially looked unwell. It was a waste of money to be honest. If you do stay here its worth getting a bus pass, the bus stop is right outside and takes you to every hotel along the strip."

Also, they built this hotel to discourage you from leaving the property. It is almost impossible to walk out the front and find the sidewalk. Also, the noise is an issue. The thin walls allows you to hear your neighbors and anyone in the hall. Also you are able to hear outside noise as well. They wash the exterior windows at 7:00 AM, very loud. The bathroom is not ideal for friends traveling together. No lock on the bathroom door and no fan in the bathroom. If you want a less crowded casino then you may want to try Mandalay, otherwise book center strip and enjoy your stay."

We were on the 24th floor in a partial strip view room. It was more of a view of the airport and there was some airplane noise and noise from Las Vegas Blvd. Much worse though was the hall noise from the revelers yelling down the halls at all hours of the night. It would be nice if the hotel offered \"quiet floors\" for those who aren't in Vegas to party until 5am. The pool area is huge and has a wave pool and lazy river. Even in late October it was very crowded. Good drink service in the pool area. The spa was very nice, but to use it and the gym it is $30 for a day pass. So, if you get in on a late afternoon flight and want to relax in the spa and then want to work out the next morning, its $60. Kind of a rip off when you're already paying $230 for a room. Like most hotels on the strip, internet was $15/day. To use the refrigerator in your room its $20/day. The buffet was very good--good food, selection and service. The Shark reef was interesting, probably not worth $16, but if you're going to eat at the buffet the reef/dinner package is a good deal. We ate breakfast at Raffels. The food was good and the portions were generous. There were also lots of other places to eat."

There was 7 of us that made the trip and I had requested rooms next to each other. That never happened. We were about 9 floors apart!! The only other problem we had is that the bathroom has no fan in it. When there's no window in a bathroom, there should be a fan! That about ends my gripes. All in all it was a beautiful hotel. There's plenty of places to get your coffee in the morning. The casino floor is really nice looking (you know how some can look dingy and depressing?!), there's definitely some cools bars and restaurants, and they have an awesome spa! I had 2 treatments done while I was there and loved every moniute of it! Plus, Mandalay Bay has a really cool pool set up. They have a wave pool, a lazy river, cabanas, private pools, beachside casino, etc. You can definitely spend a whole day out there! Here's a tip: if you want to get an innertube, there are like $25. No big deal right? You probably just lost that much in a slot machine. Well, if you just look around and people happen to be leaving, there's always someone trying to sell their innertube for half price because they don't want to take it home with them! The buffet they had was pretty cool for beakfast. Don't forget to check out the Mix, or the Foundation Room for spectacular strip views!! I'm going back in March!!!"

    "content": "This was my family's first time staying on the strip. Being from Hawaii, we usually stay in the Downtown area because of the great package deals we get with meals. However, we were able to stay at the Mandalay for a great price, though we paid and additional $28/night (3 nights total) for an upgrade to see the strip from the 31st floor...so worth it! Other than the small glitches we experienced upon check-in due to the keying system being down, everything else was great! The rooms were very spacious, with a huge bathroom (love the his/her sinks, soak-in tub, and separate toilet), the beds were comfy, and service was top-notch. Having young children, it would have been great to have use of the refrigerator, but we made do. Also, it's a bit irritating to have the snack bar items be so accessible (you just move them and you get charged), but that was easily fixed with a call to the front desk and I'm sure verification from the housekeeping staff. We ordered room service one night and expected the inflated prices, but the portions were huge and tasty! We weren't able to use the pool (too cold for us Hawaiians), but it looked great and we definitely hope to be able to make use of it the next time we go there. We had rented a car and chose to self-park it, so that was a bit far; but being on the strip, you expect that and just plan accordingly (i.e. make sure you have the stroller no matter what, whether it be for a sleeping baby or double as a cart for all of your shopping items). Lastly, though it is as the end of the strip, having the monorail definitely makes vising other attractions easier and makes for great exercise after all the eating we do in Vegas :) Overall, staying at the Mandalay definitely made our trip to Vegas this time a great one!"

I know the ecconomy is having an effect everywhere, but at Mandalay it shows in 100 little ways. Vallets and room service are slower, the lifts are not as clean, and if you need extra towels at an odd hour, be prepared to write your congressman. If this had been my first trip to this hotel I would have been able to give it a higher rating, however, it is not my first trip. I hope Mandalay brings itself up to its former standard. If not, next June will be a one day stay."

Our complaint is that the sinks kept gurgling throughout the day and night as well as occasionally in the tub. It seemed as though anytime that someone either above us or beside us ran their water, that the gurgling would start and continue on for a very long time. It's also at the very South end of the Strip so the walk was a long ways to get to the middle of the action if you didn't want to take a cab every time."

Checked in at 9:30 and told us that if we wanted King rooms to wait 30 min. or they could give us rooms w/2 Q right away. We opted for the King rooms and went to the buffet for breakfast. Checked in our rooms at about 10:30 am. They were the standard rooms and we were on the 9th floor. The desk agent offered us 14th FL rooms facing the pool, but also told us there was a beach after-party (Justin Timberlake concert) and that it might be really loud on Sat. night - I really appreciated her telling us that!!We opted for the 9th FL rooms overlooking the strip. The room was clean and good sized. The furnishings are minimalist and very neutral. The rooms look like they could use a little refurbishing as well as the hall carpeting - it looked somewhat worn and dirty. The bathroom is a very good size, but the shower is pretty small. The bathroom amenities were average but the maid brought me some nicer ones after I had left a tip for her (I didn't ask for them either) Everything worked great - ipod docking station, large flat screen in the bedroom, small flatscreen in the bathroom. Nice divan w/good sized desk. Great mattress on the bed and comfortable linens. Beach/Pool - went on arrival day and it was already really crowded. They could use pool attendants to help find and secure chairs. Didn't try the lazy river because I didn't want to pay $20 to rent an innertube - ridiculous!! The water in the pool was warm. I really dont understand why this pool rates so high, I like the pool at the MIrage and Hard Rock much better - just a personal preference. There were pool waitresses and they probably could have used a few more as well as they were covering a lot of distance themselves and service was a little slow. The casino has a very nice vibe. It is not terribly large and it is spaced out well. There are plenty of ticket machines to cash out from. There seemed to be less waitresses in the casino as well. The rest of the complex flows out well from the casino and the walkways to the restaurants are easy to navigate. You don't have to cut through the middle of the casino to get to them. It was nearly impossible to find table games for less than $10 min. but that was expected especially on the weekend. We ate at the buffet once for breakfast and it was very good. I was pleasantly surprised by the desserts - they actually tasted good which is unusual for most buffets in my experience. They could have used 2 omelette stations as the wait was about 10 min to get one. We ate at Fleur de Lys which was outstanding. We picked up pastries and coffee at Red, White and Blue - the pastries were very good (much better than Starbucks). We had lunch at the House of Blues restaurant and it was good. The staff are all very friendly here. Pleasant even. The common areas of the hotel are very nicely kept up. The Mandalay has a very pleasant exotic smell to it -somewhat islandy. We did not try the spa as it costs $30/day to work out and use facilities - too much in my opinion. The spa treatments are all about double or more over what I am used to paying so we did not make use of those either. Internet Wi-fi is available for $10/day. We did not have a computer so we didn't use this ammenity. However, you can go to the Starbucks in the food area and use their wi-fi for free. Also, if you drink soda or bottled water it is much cheaper to buy them from the vending machines on your floor than at the shops in the hotel. Overall we are glad we finally stayed at the Mandalay. We would try TheHotel next before we would return to the Mandalay just to try something new and different. Also, if you need your boarding passes printed you can do them for free in the Business Center."

The Japanese lunch deal was a partial steal which offers an assortment of sushi such as spicy tuna rolls etc. The overall elegance especially seen in the lobby with its grand Victorian inspired entrance as well as the stair case veranda within the lobby are all very eye appealing and atmospheric. One thing to note, when playing on the slot machines, if your ticket gets stuck, help is always available and courteous. I hope I come back to the Mandalay Bay."

Our room was very clean and comfortable. I read a lot of reviews of the hotel so I did not really know what to expect. Mandalay Bay exceeded our expectations by far. It is just a beautiful property. The elevators were not busy when we were there (early October) so it is hard to understand all the complaints about them. Restaurants were a little pricey, but the food and service were excellent. We liked the casino and the shuttles to Luxor etc. Beware - they don't run before noon. With all the shopping in Vegas, I enjoyed their gift shop - very nice and some nice sales, too.

    "content": "I recently traveled with my girlfriend to Vegas while she attended a conference for work. The conference was at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, and we were able to stay in the resort for several nights. To get from the airport to the hotel, we took the round-trip shuttle for $13 per person. That worked out really well. The Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino grounds are huge and everything that you need is right there at your fingertips. The rooms are very nice, with really decent bathrooms. They have a stand-up shower, a separate tub, his and her sinks and a separate room with the toilet. From the resort, you can walk to the Luxor & Excalibur via tunnels through the casinos, and it\u2019s easy to get to MGM Grand, NY NY, etc. from there. Inside the resort, there are tons of shops, but everything was pretty expensive. To give you an idea, the convenience store in the resort charged $8 for a small tube of Crest ProHealth toothpaste (so don\u2019t forget your toothpaste at home) and $6 for a bottle of beer. Also, practically nothing is included in the room price. Internet access is $15 per day \u2013 but if you go to Starbucks in the Resort, you can connect to free Wi-Fi. Also, in order to work out in the gym, the price is $15 per day. I wouldn\u2019t bother shopping in the hotel - the best shopping is at the Forum at Caesar\u2019s Palace. All of the stores at the Forum are mid- to high-end fashion. Inside the resort and on the strip, there are tons of restaurant options, but again, everything in the resort was expensive. I would have to say that the best bargain in the resort was the Border Grill (Mexican theme). The food was really good, and average priced. Most of the restaurants in the hotel and in the area can also be found on Resturant.com. I\u2019ve have been using the Restaurant.com site for years and it\u2019s really a great deal (you can get a $25 gift certificate on sale for $2 and save yourself a significant amount of money on food). If you are willing to spend a decent amount of money on food, I\u2019d recommend Stripsteak inside the resort. They have 28-day aged steak and it was so good!!! One tip would be to ensure that any restaurants you go to are actually on the strip unless you have a rental car. The service in Vegas was outstanding. We went to Vegas about 4 years ago and stayed at the MGM Grand (which is nice but not as nice as Mandalay Bay) and the service at the time in Vegas was just okay. It\u2019s weird, but I think the recession has made Vegas more consumer/customer friendly."

Noise level - hardly any noise -- except for where the connecting doors are. I could hear the couple next door yelling at each other the whole time. Why come to Vegas to scream at each other. I liked the casino - very little smoke smell. I took a walking trip down the strip and noticed how loud the other casinos were -- very loud music. Mandalay Bay had music, but it wasn't in your face. It was so relaxing to return after visiting several other casinos. I didn't have time to visit the 'beach' this trip, but have a great view from the room. It looked so fun and inviting.

    "content": "My husband and I were in Vegas celebrating a friend's birthday. The Mandalay Bay was her choice and, of course, we wanted to be wherever she wanted to stay. Due to flight schedules we arrived early (before noon) and were pleased to be able to check in and get our rooms right away. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. We've stayed at several different Vegas hotels over the years and this was the first time we didn't feel like we had to walk another couple of miles once inside just to get to our room. THAT was a nice bonus! We had breakfast at the House of Blues one morning and found it to be very good food and reasonably priced (for Vegas). We had a little bit of pool time and it was OK. The wave pool was nice and a very comfortable temperature but it's not saltwater so you're not as buoyant...consequently it's not exactly like bodysurfing in the ocean. But it was still fun. We were there during week yet the chairs appeared to be quite full in the afternoon (or there were a lot of towels left behind that didn't get picked up). We saw a lot of cocktail waitresses walking around yet not one stopped to offer service so we had to walk to the bar. Not that big of a deal for us but it was strange seeing so many of them but never observing them actually taking orders or delivering drinks. The location of the Mandalay Bay is probably the biggest detractor for us. If you like to be in the heart of the action on the strip you're going to need to take a taxi. With tip, we would easily drop $20 (each way) for the ride to be dropped off near Caesar's or Planet Hollywood. Again, not that big of a deal but don't kid yourself in to thinking you can walk it. All in all it was a very pleasant stay. If the hotel were anywhere else we'd gladly stay there again. But because we like to be more \"in the middle\" of things we are not likely to go back."

THE GOOD: staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was anice--great view, and a spacious bathroom and tub. We loved the lazy river and wave pool, it was a great way to spend the afternoon since it wasn't too hot. We had some great meals at the Border Grill, Spago, and Burger Bar. The buffet was OK--but very efficient, with short to non-existent lines. THE VERY BAD: this was the SMOKIEST casino hotel we've been to. Yes, there is smoking in all casinos and that won't change, but Mandalay Bay seemed the worst. A) no smoke-free tables like many casinos do, B) Davidoff cigars and cigarettes were aggressively sold around the room, and C) the ventilation seemed very poor--smoke permeated everywhere--into the restaurants, the lobby--even the hallways of the non-smoking rooms! We STUNK at the end of the night we played in its casino. Not so after others (including Bellagio, Hard Rock, Cesars, and MGM). ALSO, the pool's \"beach\" was a little like a giant ashtray--it felt cleaner to sit in the pool area. Our vacation was still great, but I would probably not stay at this casino hotel again."

Lots of great restaurants at the hotel - we ate at these and I'd recommend them all: Strip Steak, House of Blues, and the Sushi restaurant. Happy hour at House of Blues great value. Easy to hop on tram to Luxor and then walk to New York for the roller coaster. Saw Criss Angel's show at Luxor - give it a 7/10. If shopping, taxi to Miracle Mile shops - stop by the Cheeseburger Restaurant and grab a Mai Tai in a big plastic pineapple cup to go!"

The room, labeled a suite, was nothing like a suite at all. I think the bathroom was the nicest part yet the room was drab and average. The hotel's eateries were overpriced and fairly empty for our 4th of July weekend stay. We checked out the shark exhibit which for $18 or so pp, a 10 minute walk thru was not my idea of what I expected. The pool areas were crowded, as to be expected in July, and were clean, yet they do not allow you to take in mini totes for beverages so we had to leave ours at the door and hope that no one took it (which no one did). I think my stay at the MIrage, Alexis Park and other more reasonably priced hotels I had much better rooms, an actual suite and better price options for buffets and eateries. I'm not saying the hotel is horiible, just nothing as it should be for the price you pay! Oh and the tattoo shop in there is a RIP OFF! Unless you wanna pay a hefty price for a tat you'll need touched up immediately, I wouldnt suggest spending the dough!"

There seemed to be always something going on here so by the 4th day we were ready to leave. There was wind noise in our room through the window and a constant beat of music day and night so it was hard to get sleep. One more day would have killed me. Maybe this place is for a younger crowd. The pool was nice, but the life guards kept blowing whistles and there seemed to be a lot of rules. I don't understand with 7 lifeguards why they couldn't gently talk to people instead of keep blowing the whistle asking people to move over the line. I guess 2 ft deep in the wave pool was extremely dangerous. The main down point of this hotel is that is located on the far end of the strip so a long haul from the other attractions. We also found the tram stops running at 10pm so you get to the tram and then find out you have walk from the excalabur which is a bummer at midnight or later. The other down point is there is no place to sit in the hotel except the casino or bar or pool. So if you check out you have to go to the beach or gamble or drink. They get you comming and going. They also have a minibar that registers if you just touch anything so you pick it up and they charge you."

We were initially upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite which was fantastic, but just for one night and after the initial thrill, we discovered that some housekeeping had been overlooked, but it still was nice for the one night. Since we got in so late, we didn't have much time to enjoy since we had to be out of that room by 11AM, but did enjoy the best room service ever. Wish I could remember the waiter's name. He made us feel really special. The room we were moved to was pretty much like any other room except for the bathroom, which was quite large. The toilet is separated from the sinks (2, which was great!), shower and tub. We both felt very claustrophobic in the private area and had to use a can of shaving cream to prop it open (there are french doors which close off the entire bathroom from the bedroom. I have stayed at the MGM, Paris, Treasure Island, Barbary Coast and Gold Coast in Las Vegas and would rate the first 4 with better rooms overall. The first 3 with better casinos. To me, a better casino is a better choice of slots, not too crowded and a place where I can get away from the smoke. There was a wide choice of restaurants and the 24 hour restaurant, Raffles was a very nice \"coffee shop,\" but the service was painstakingly slow. Good food, but poor service. The \"beach\" was so crowded we couldn't find a spot....luckily, my aunt had also come and she and her friend gave us their chairs. I think the MGM has a better pool set up. I have not enjoyed Paris or Treasure Island's pool areas, so can not compare. All in all we had a great time, but spent most of our time at other places, but I am glad I experienced it, but there are other places I will try next time at the price."

The parking was as far away as it could be - took my husband 20-30 min. to park and make it to the room. The fridge/wet bar in the room had a neat trick - it was priced by weight - if that weight changed up or down, they charged you!

After about a 30 minute of miserable walk and very slow duce buses from the central strip area, we all jump into the wave pool and lazy river pool. They were awesome! I highly recommend that to everyone: I mean everyone should enjoy the cool water in the middle of desert under strong sun! It was safe and clean (NEVER CROWDED)! Among all the hotels that we have stayed over three weeks including Toronto, Niagara Falls, and Chicago, Las Vegas hotel is far the best.

    "content": "Had a great stay at Mandalay Bay from Sept 27-30. This was the first part of a 6 night stay that included The Mirage (separate review). We arrived quite early (1:30pm), and approached Dan at the check-in desk. He was a very nice man and told us that our room was ready (we were surprised). Our room was a Vista Suite, 33-235. The room was absolutely fabulous. It is a huge room, over 1600 square feet, with great views from every room. We were at the end of the hallway, so noise was not a problem as we were only connected to one other room that was in the living room area (the bedroom wall was up against the emergency staircase). From the dining room we had a nice view of the airport, from the bedroom we could see the mountains, pool and convention area, and from the living room the best view of the strip that I think you could get. The dining table seats 6, there is a wet bar with a TV and minibar and separate fridge, the living area has a huge TV and stereo system and the bedroom has I would say only a queen bed and another TV. The bathroom is huge with double sinks, in mirror TV, jetted tub and party shower with steam. There is also a \u00bd bath behind the bar area and motorized drapes throughout. Four separate thermostats control the cooling and did a great job. While the furniture is a little worn, the room was extremely clean and quite modern. Upscale amenities, a great view and the great price we received, make this probably one of the best suites for the money in Vegas. The Mandalay Beach area is another great asset to the property. There is a beach with real sand, a wave pool, 2 separate other pools and a lazy river. My wife really enjoyed the lazy river as she just floated and did not us a tube. The current was quite fast in here. The waves in the wave pool were not that impressive and only happened every couple minutes, but it was enough to give you that feeling of being in the ocean. We went to the pool around 11am and there were still quite a few chairs, but by 1pm most were taken. There were only a few cabanas in use, I suspect because of the high price that they charge. The remainder of the property was very clean, and did not notice much trash or broken equipment at all. There are many, many restaurants to choose from. We ate at Raffles twice which offered a good price for what you got. Kind of disappointed that the food court only had one or two places open and was a long way from the rooms. There is a small mini-mart across the street to pick up snacks and beverages along with a McDonalds, Subway and Panda Express. This was our second time in Vegas, stayed at the Venetian previously, and we really enjoyed Mandalay Bay. The only real negative is that it is at the end of the strip, so getting anywhere calls for a cab or a hike. But if you take the tram to Excalibur, it is not too bad. If you want to relax by the pool or beach, do a little gambling and enjoy the resort itself, Mandalay Bay is a great choice."

Wonderful night spots and restaurants are dispersed around the casino, with a great big bar in the middle for meeting up with others. The Beach adds a fun dimension to the pool experience. Everyone was friendly and paid attention to details. the sport book is a good size with plenty of TVs for watching all the games. Nothing is better then being there over a big sports weekend. I would highly recommend Mandalay Bay for anyone who wants to experience the higher end of Vegas. It is definately my favorite location."

    "content": "This was only my second time visiting Las Vegas, but my boyfriend has traveled there on several occasions and Mandalay Bay is his favorite place to stay. I absolutely loved my first experience there! Location: The hotel is at the end of the strip but there is a tram you can take further down. We felt the need for a long walk after eating so much at dinner anyway. The Mandalay Bay property is so large we didn't really feel the need to leave. We walked (through the indoor mall) to the Luxor and also to the MGM, but that was it. There was plenty to do at Mandalay Bay. Casino: Compared to the Luxor and MGM's casinos, I liked Mandalay's the best. I have a strong distaste for smoking and Mandalay's casino was well ventilated, clean and bright. However, blackjack table minimums were $15, but they did have 25 cent - $1 dollar blackjack machines. The wait staff in the casino were exceptional... very prompt with drinks. Rooms: Nicely decorated and clean. Very comfortable beds!! I thought I was at home! They have pillow top mattresses, down comforters and different kinds of pillows that were also very comfortable. The bathrooms have marble floors and stand up showers. The best part of our room for me was the view. We were on the 32nd floor with a strip view. Each room has ceiling to floor windows so you can really take it all in. Food: We ate at the Bayside Buffet for most of our meals because we were trying to save a little money. Still expensive but we definitely ate our money's worth! One of the nights we went to the Border Grill to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. This was some of the best Mexican food I have ever tasted (and being from Colorado we have great Mexican food here). The service was excellent and they even brought out a free dessert for my boyfriend's birthday, topped with a lighted candle. I typically hate dessert at Mexican restaurants but this was a homemade chocolate mousse with oreo cookie crust - delicious! My only complaint was that the $12 margaritas we ordered came in very small glasses... I would say 12oz.? We didn't end up ordering a second one! Pool: Mandalay Bay is known for its pool and I can see why! They have a few small pools, plus a heated wave pool, hot tub (but it wasn't very hot), and a lazy river. The weather was great while we were there and the pool gets very busy. Still, we were able to find two chairs together without a problem - even in the middle of the day. The wait staff there were also great - prompt service and came around often to see if you needed anything. Overall, I noticed that everything is expensive. I still gave a \"5\" for value because we got a lot of food for the price, free drinks in the casino (which made up for the tiny but expensive margaritas elsewhere), and we got a good deal on our room rate. I will definitely return to Mandalay Bay in the future."

    "content": "We stayed at the MB for eight days and really enjoyed this hotel. Check in was a little slow but they cannot control how many planes land at the same time. They had a full staff on and when it was my turn the girl was very pleasant and helpful. We got a great room on the 15th floor and looked at the airport. We enjoyed watching the planes coming and going. Never had any issues with the elevators as some others had and the cleaning staff were very good. The pools were the best. Always got a chair and never had to look for one. Probably the time of year as the kids are back in school. We did notice more families on the weekend. We have been to Las Vegas lots and were very aware where we were situated on the strip. We like to walk so this was not a issue for us. We would take the tram to Excalibur and walk from there. If you do not like to walk the bus system runs constantly in front of the MGM Grand. It is much quieter than being in mid-strip. I do agree the restaurants have gotten more expensive. They give you a break on the rooms but not the food. We had good meals though. In the hotel we ate at Raffles (huge portions) Border Grill and House of Blues. Had no complaints about any of the food. Watch for coupons in the Vegas guide you get in the Taxi Cabs you can get a two for one breakfast in the House of Blues. We ate at the Tropicana their special two lobster tails and it was delicious and good sized lobsters for 19.99 (with their players card) . We also ate at Dirty Dicks in Excalibur it was fun! We saw two excellent shows Terry Fator (amazing) and the Lion King. We would stay at this hotel again."

    "content": "Attended an Awards Show in Mid-August. The Hoodie Awards - hosted by Steve Harvey The Hotel really wasn't ready for those that came, but they were whipped into shape for next year. Since I had a package deal, I added a day at the beginning and at the end of my package. The check-in staff finally realized what was going on and all was well; HOWEVER, they kept locking my room in the middle of the day. I had to tell the lady, \"please do not make me come back down here. Honor my reservations ad ONE and please do not lock the door. It's inconvenient to keep coming to this desk.\" I think they got the message. The room was Luscious. Luscious Beds. Luscious Television (wall mounted plasma). Luscious bathtub separate from the luscious shower. Not to mention the Marble top on the double sinks. The toilet was separated with a door (need to have ventilation in the smaller toilet area). Each night's sleep was the best and you rarely heard any noise, esp. knowing that the hotel was full of guests. Mandalay Bay is HUGE!!! Put on some comfortable shoes and enjoy the walking, the shops, the restaurants, the pool area (never made it there, but walked past) and just the ambiance. Stayed at the Luxor the day prior and it was delightful to walk thru the walkway to the Mandalay. Also, use the free monorail that runs between The Excalibur, The Luxor and The Mandalay. ...cannot wait to return and hopefully, the Check-in Staff will be ready for the amazing Awards show crowd."

That said, the other attraction for me is gambling--given its distance from the rest of the strip, I feel sort of trapped at this casino unless I want to get a cab. Staying at a property in the \"heart of the strip\" would have been preferable to me."

We went to speak to management where they offered us a free spa treatment instead. We asked for it to be changed into a food/room credit and they agreed. Upon checking out we were told that we had paid all of the charges and owed nothing else. A month later a charge appeared on our credit card for the food we had charged to the room that we had a credit for. Months of calling and arguing did nothing and we eventually just paid the credit card bill. We never would have eaten at their restaurant if we had not had the credit. Mandalay Bay lied and then stole from us."

    "content": "We stayed here in April of this year and liked it so much we decided to go back. This stay was just as great as the last one, the only difference was the room which was on the third floor and did not have a view like we had last time. I did not ask to change rooms which they may have been able to do. They did accommodate our early check in as our plane landed at 10:30 which was nice. There was fast check in and out and no waits for elevators. We went down to the pool around 1:30 and though it was crowded, we did find two chairs fairly easily. There were some children there, but most seemed to be back in school. The crowd was nice a lot of middle aged and European travelers. They have the Moorea pool/club which is European style (topless optional.) My husband spent time there. They gave away water one day and they have plushier chairs. I don't think there is as much shade there except at the bar. It was 100 when we got there 9-28 and I need a certain amt of shade during the day. There are trees and shday spots, but it is good to get there early to get them. The pool opens at 9 and closes at 6pm. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. No bad experiences. I ordered two boxes of tissues from the room service and they came within 10 minutes. We ate two days at the Bayside Buffet for the 35.00 eat all day deal which worked well. Even though we just ate breakfast and dinner, it was a good deal. The Luxor Buffet had a similar deal for $30.00 per person. Another night we went to the buffet at the Bellagio and it was good too with a lot of selections especially seafood and sushi for those who like that. The conservatory was excellent and decorated for Fall, definately worth seeing! On Wed nights at the Strotosphere they have smooth jazz at 7pm. Get there early and get a booth to watch the sunset! The lounge is just above the restaurant Top of the World and there is no fee to get up there. Save yourself the expensive meal and have a drink at the lounge. Another cool place to have a drink is the Peppermill Lounge by the Sahara which has a firepit. We went to Mix at the top of The Hotel and it was wonderful. We went early before 10 when there was no cover. They have appetizers and expensive, but well prepared drinks. We were able to sit outside which offered a marvelous view of the strip. We went to Hooter's at night as they had one table of $3 blackjack. We went to the Shark Reef exhibit at MB. It was pretty impressive, though somewhat smaller than I thought it would be. We went as early as possible at 10 am and there was a group of tourists and a bus of school children. It may be better to go later. They are open until 9-10 depending on the day. Did not hear any noise from other rooms. Coffee can be had at Starbuck's near the convention center or Orchid's Lounge."

So glad I did. I had a nearly perfect experience and can't wait to go back next spring. Some of these reviews puzzle me, because I am picky and have stayed everywhere in Vegas from the Thunderbird Motel to Four Seasons, and I really could not fault much here. From the bell getting my bags when I arrived, to the excellent check in clerk to the maid requests I made when first arriving, to the easy check out over the phone the morning I left, it was just one great relaxing day after another. I heard no other guests and I spent a lot of time in my room (loved the bath and the big TV/little bath tv and room service). I asked for an upper floor with no afternoon sun and got a great airport/strip view on the 60th floor, which had a private elevator bank, so no waiting. If you don't want to leave a credit card or cash for incidentals, it is no problem here. They put you on cash only for room service, but you can use a credit card when you order. Also, I played the same bank of triple play VP mostly, and every different shift of cocktail waitress was great. Maybe it was where I was sitting, but I was never in need of a thing. People who complain about no coffee pots and refrigerators really need to read the hotel websites or call ahead of time if that is important. It is not the norm in Vegas, but they spell it out on most websites and it's your duty to check that, not theirs to provide what they say they don't clearly on their ads. Definitely give this place a try, it's beautiful. Don't miss Cantor's Deli back in the Sportsbook, awesome sandwiches."

    "content": "I have been to Las Vegas many times, the cheap rooms combined with the shows and the restaurants make the place unique. I don't gamble so I am there purely for the social scene. This was the third time I had stayed in the Mandalay Bay, previously I have stayed at the Bellagio, NYNY, MGM, Golden Nugget. Depending on what you are looking for this could be the ideal place for you. What does it for me is the lack of smoke, unlike every other Las Vegas casino this one seems through virtue of its horizontal dimensions manages to diffuse the smoke. You do not leave with your clothes smelling of smoke after a walk past reception, it has a fresh smell to it. This time I checked in with my girlfriend and they upgraded us to a sky view suite which has a private elevator near concierge. It was such a nice surprise to be given the room. The room was about 1,000 sq feet and had a view of the pool. Just a heads up for those of you thinking about staying in the Hotel or in the main hotel. If you have a choice between a suite in the main hotel or the Hotel, choose the main hotel. The suites will be bigger. The age range in the Hotel is lower than that in the main hotel. Go for dinner in the Aureole, it is my favourite restaurant in the whole world. They have a selection of about 40,000 wines there, when you are choosing your wine they give you a pda to help you with the wine pairings. Once you order they punch the coordinates into their little machine. There is a wine tower about 4 stories high holding red wines, a lady with a trapeze artist type strap on her back gets raised towards where your bottle is and she elegantly decends to ground level with the bottle, an amazing thing to see! Seeing mama mia there is another pleasure, if you have seen it on broadway or another city see it here too. They have the most talented cast here so it sounds on a different level to the other venues. If you are staying here you should do so during the summer when the pool is open. There is a man-made beach which is breathtaking, if the pools are closed you are missing out. One of the events of my life was watching 'Swingers' being shown on the beach at 8pm while we were all on the sun loungers having drinks. The weather was just perfect with a cool breeze and the golden buildings lit up behind us. The spa here again is incredible, my advice would be to go for the day long pampering which lasts about 5 hours it includes a seaweed wrap, massage, manicure, pedicure. See what your budget allows. The Mix bar on the top floor of theHotel should also not be missed, it has a splendid view of the strip, you can walk out onto a balcony about 40 floors up and have the moist las vegas breeze blowing into your face, the strip is so beautiful with the lights all lit up. The only downside is the location which is the base of the strip, however it is easy to get to the middle of the strip through the monorail which connects inside the building. There are also so many cabs around so it isn't a really big deal. Staying here you are in a trendy upscale place which doesn't smell bad, it has a tropical theme about it with palm trees and marble floors. It is my place of choice, I think you will enjoy it, but book in advance and look out for the deals! Enjoy!!"

I have a feeling they recycle their water... The stench was unbearable. Many of the restaurants do NOT have bathrooms. You must exit the restaurant and use the bathrooms in the casino. Very inconvienent. Our in-room phone indicated that there was a message. I checked and NO voicemail. The phone still blinked and blinked and blinked and blinked. Still no voicemail. Why is it blinking \"new message\", if we don't have any messages?!? Grrrrrrr. The walls in the room are PAPER-THIN.

Lost a lot of money at the other hotel but at least was treated like a guest and not nickel and dimed by all the extra costs associatated with Mandaly Bay. But the worst thing about Mandalay was the general lack of concern I received from not just one isolated employee but 5 different ones. One bad employee would have been acceptable but 5 within the first 5 hours was just too many to justify giving them all my money and time."

    "content": "Beautifully maintained and appointed hotel, excellent rooms and public facilities but best of all, away from the noise and hurly burly of the main part of the Strip. Staff were very helpful and polite. Restaurants varied from cheap quick burger to haute cuisine. The casino was large and airy and the machines well spaced out, and unlike most other hotels it wasn't the first thing you saw before you registered. Pool area was busy but generally beds were available (pick your spot early). We don't have a bad thing to say about Mandalay Bay and would definitely stay there again. Travel tips - catch the free shuttle to Las Vegas Outlet Centre, the Deuce ($3 single) downturn or the free monorail and then the low cost tram to cover the whole of the Strip. LV is very accessible for those who require a little extra help getting around."

The beach area with the wave machine was great fun. This hotel is at the far end of the strip. If it is your first visit I would not recommend it as it is a bit of a trek to the main hub of the strip. Their is a free tram if you walk to the Luxor that takes you to Escalibur you then walk to mgm to get the mono rail, $5 a trip each. Do not under estamate how far you walk to get the tram and mono rail as they are all set that you need to walk through all of the casinos to get to them. Much better to jump in a cab, it was $13 from the hotel to the Bellagio and no sore feet!"

    "content": "We visited Mandalay Bay for a 3 night stay to attend a trade show the hotel was hosting. We travel 3 times a year for these type shows and this was by far my least favorite venue. I was dismayed that even though the price tag for a nights stay there was premium, the cost did not justify the visit. The Good: -Clean -Entire resort is absolutley beautiful. The Bad: -$15 per 24 hour usage of high speed internet, totally unreasonable. Howard Johnson's gives you free internet for goodness sakes. -Ye olde \"We don't have any of those rooms available\" Even though reservation was prepaid 2 months in advance. They \"fixed\" the problem after we gave the receptionist the whole Seinfeld \"That's the point of a reservation\" line. -Disneyworld prices on steroids. They provide you with no breakfast, not even coffee and a roll. They do this so you must wander down into their labrynth of restaurants. Might I suggest the Meusli, Coffee and (1) glass of juice for $22. The prices scale up from there, use your imagination. -They have an assortment of snacks in the room. Do not take or move these 59 cent snacks. You will be charged for them, and guess what the mark up is...it's a lot. So we ate the snacks of doom and the following insued... We recieved an email that is essentially a bill for $106.99. Immediatly we were alarmed and called Mandalay Bay to see what the deal was. Apparantly we are insane, deaf and blind. \"The woman at the desk tells you there is a charge for those things\" (guess what, she didn't) AND \"there is a sign in front of those items listing the prices and procedure for purchasing\" (You will never believe this, there wasn't). Surely, we could sort this out. Upon calling them, it was very clear this was indeed a racket. The conversation with the representative of their company was frustrating and yielded minor results. After talking as sweetly as possible and getting a rude indignant attitude in return, our bill was reduced by 50%. In my opinion the mere fact that there were willing to lower the bill is an admission that they realize this practice is absolutley unsavory and dishonest. All in all, we have never paid so much for so little. Every opportunity they get to pick your pocket, they do so."

So seeing I was jet lagged (by 9 hours) I called the Mandalay to see if they had a room available for an early check in. The receptionist said yes and I could come along. Hopped in a taxi and was there in 5 min....Vegas is small. Got to reception and it is HUGE. The desk must be about 90 feet long. I lined up and was seen to in about 10 min. People were checking out. When i got to the desk the girl said I have to leave my bags with the bell hop and check in later. I advised her about my phone call and she had to go and check and then succombed to giving me my room......somewhat begrudgingly. Room was the same size as the Hard Rock, big by international standards. Bathroom was also big with a seperate bath and shower. The toilet was in a seperate little room at the back of the bathroom. The flushing was surprising......just like an airplane. The mandalay is MASSIVE. You cannot help but stand back and just take it all in. The walkway from the Hotel to the conference center was bigger than some hotels I have stayed in. Casino floor was on a hug expanse surrounded by many restaurants, shops and even a tatoo parlor. I was tempted but not drunk enough! WIFI was $15 a day. I was a bit disappointed about that, would have liked it to be free. I had breakfast across the road at Mc Donalds as I did not want to spend $20 on a huge breakfast and also the lines to get into the restaurants were long. A Sausage and Egg McMuffen would do for me thanks. Mc Doonalds did not have free WIFI either as they do in Europe. Went to the Burger Bar for dinner. Had the sampler plate with 3 mini burgers. Sat at the bar. Value was good. The second day my room was not cleaned when I came back form the conference at about 4pm. So I called and asked them to come and service the room. Went out exploring Vegas and when I came back it was still not done. I did not bother calling again and just slept in the second bed. I like sleeping on fresh sheets! Check out was 11am but I checked out at 8am as I would have been at the conference. Unless you need a hard copy of your receipt you can check out on your TV and just leave the room. I was goign to have some packages sent to the hotel as I had done some on line shopping before my arrival. The advised me that receiving the packages is doen by the business centre and they charge $10 a package. So I had just sent them to the Hard Rock for Free. Saved me $40! Tried to use the gym during my stay but was advised that it was $20 a day even if you are a guest. That was a first. So I listed whether the gym has a hotel as NO."

Many great places to eat. The aquarium, lots of shopping, The club RUM jungle ( one of my favorites ) The pool as a wave pool with real sand. It is always packed though but they have other pools that are relaxing. It also has a connector to the luxor, and easy walking to new york, new york and the MGM. Make sure to sign up for the players card you get a lot of great offers through the year."

    "content": "I got a great rate from Travelocity 2 nights plus airfare for $300. That works out to about $100 a night for a Sunday Monday stay. For that price, the room and hotel are absolutely gorgeous. The lobby and casino of this property are very elegant, well lit, and clean. My room was fabulous and might have been the cleanest I\u2019ve stayed in for quite a while. There is no \u201chotel\u201d smell in the hallways or room, no cleanser or smoke scent to be noticed any time. When you open up your door it just smells clean. For some sick reason I even went hunting for filth in the corners of the shower and under the bed and found nothing but clean accommodation. Like some other reviewers noted, the front desk is set up without ropes so you just have to pick the window to line up behind, which could be frustrating if you happen to get behind the person who has some impossible problem, while other lines are going quickly. When I did get to the desk it was quick and easy and I was offered a choice of mountain, pool, or strip view. I chose the strip view and it was great. Floor to ceiling windows offered a great view of the strip and a little of the airport. The room had nice new furniture, a giant HD flatscreen and a very comfortable new pillow top bed. For being such a nice property, I thought the pool area was a little janky. A lot of the grounds and chairs just seemed worn and run down, and there was wet towels everywhere. Both days my chair had stains and what looked like old gum on it. I\u2019m not a big fan of the sand out there because it gets everywhere and makes a mess. There was sand in all the pools even those not near the \u201cbeach.\u201d For those complaining about the crowds and the kids you just need to go at a different time. At 4:30 on a Monday afternoon in September, I practically had the lazy river all to myself. Drink service was good and not hideously expensive and the river and wave pool are pretty fun although the lifeguards ARE kind of jerks. Went to the buffet and it wasn\u2019t great. Service was HORRIBLE, I was seated at a table with someone\u2019s filthy silverware thrown across it, and I was told to just wait although there were 70 other empty tables available. Yeah its real appetizing to walk in and sit next to someone\u2019s nasty dirty dishes right before you eat, just take me to another table!! My server left me with a used plate and empty ice tea for the WHOLE MEAL, which was particularly uncomfortable because all the meats were really over salted. Other than that the food was ok, standard buffet fare nothing noteworthy although the bagels were shamefully stale. Mirage buffet is miles above this place. All in all was an awesome stay except for the buffet and don\u2019t expect too much from the pool. I will definitely stay here again."

There were a few more on the weekend, but even so, the young children are not permitted in the wave pool. There were some in the lazy river, but not enough to bother us. Oh, and don't waste your money on the tubes for the lazy iver. You don't need them. The river moves quite fast, and we enjoyed just floating down it on our own. It was great! The room was also great and was cleaned daily. Even the towels that were hung up were replaced daily. Some of the staff at the Mandalay Bay seems not eager to please the customers, but most were wonderful. You will find a couple bad ones everywhere. The front desk was very helpful and check -in and check-out were a breeze. The hotel was full, but it is so big that it didn't seem that way. We were on floor 26 and had absolutely no problems with the elevators. We ate at the buffet for breakfast, Raffles for breakfast, and Burger Bar. They were all great. We also went to the Minus 5 Club. It is a pretty new bar there where everything is made of ice - the tables, the bar, the glasses, etc. It was expensive but really fun! It was a nice break from the heat outside. The cover is $25, but that includes a mixed drink. We also loved the grounds, but the pools (wave and lazy river) were our favorites. We met a lot of people in the wave pool. It is on the end of the strip, but with the tram, you don't notice it as much. Take advantage of the fact that the tram goes to the Excalibur and the Excalibur is connected to NYNY and the MGM. It will help a lot."

From the minute I arrived the front desk clerk was FAST he had me checked-in in about 1 minute. I had a nice room overlooking the pool and the mountains. I could see the airport too, it was a great view. The room had a flat screen tv over the dresser and a small tv in the bathroom. The king bed was so soft I never slept better. The bathroom was very very clean it has a separate shower and tub and two sinks. The room also had ample lighting, mini bar, safe, desk and a nice seating area. The Resort had the best men's spa I had ever been to. The spa featured a HOT eucalyptus steam room, dry sauna. 1 warm hot tub 2 hot tubs with water falls and one cold plunge pool. Private showers and every kind of product you needed hair spray, mouth wash, powder, soap, shave cream, razors...etc. A lot of room to spread out and enjoy. All the guys that were in the spa agreed this is the best spa in Las Vegas. They also had many kinds of juice, fruit drinks, water,and tea/coffee to enjoy in the waiting room. EXCELLENT JOB ON THE LAYOUT and well done to the friendly spa staff. I also had a great deep tissue massage for 25 min $95.00. The general spa day pass was $30.00 for use of the wet areas and gym. The pools were so much fun I believe I counted a total of 7 one belonging to the guests of the Four seasons Hotel ( on the top floors of Mandalay Bay). The wave pool and Lazy river were great the sand beach added charm to the pool area. As far as the rest of the hotel the restaurants are all expensive with the exception of the Buffet and the Cafe/Deli. If you are in need of a food court just take the FREE tram to the Luxor or the Excalibur and you then have many alternate fast places to dine. The casino is big and had a lot of slots and tables. I did not make it down to the shark reef, but I heard it was well worth it. I must say after many trips to Las Vegas Mandalay Bay now ranks up pretty high. I cant wait to return."

The rooms (we stayed in the 550 - is exactly what you see online) lots of space, double sinks in the bathroom, large tub, glass enclosed showers. They are trying to be green like all other hotels and will only replace your towels every three days unless you leave them on the floor then you will get new ones just like every other hotel in the world. Beds are very comfortable and the floor to ceiling windows are great, we had a view of the strip! The elevators on floors 2-12 seemed quieter than 13 and up, I guess that's because most people want to be higher up for the better view but we were on floor 12 and it was a great view! The vending machines on the hotel floors sell drinks for $2 very reasonable and there is no problem bringing them down to the pool. They will only check your bag to see if you have glass on you. We even brought our own alcohol down to the pool and ice in a cooler. The wave pool, lazy river, hot tub and other \"regular\" pools were more than we expected! We brought our own tubes from home which they will inflate for you for free! Food at the beach was great but a little pricey, the veggie burgers are the best I've ever had. The casino was really nice and spaced out not crowded like the other hotels. It also had a nice smell to it. We got a players card and used it everywhere, every slot and every table (just give it to the dealer) and then you go back to the players desk and ask what kind of comps you can get. We only had time to use $20 for an ice cream shop that I wanted to go to, but you can pick from anything in the hotel or any that are connected to it (MGM, Excalibur, Luxor, Bellagio etc..) I could go on and on, it was a great stay and we will return!!! Oh, and use the free tram to go to Excalibur and Luxor!"

If you want to use their ATM, the cost is $ 10 fee for a cash withdrawal between $20-50 and the fees go up from there. There are no mini-bars in the room, and a diet coke cost $ 3.00 in the gift shop. But, what got me the most was the beach and the lazy river. The beach has over 12 lifeguards in one section alone, and the lazy river, has inter-tubes you must buy for $ 25 to use. How about they have half the life guards and give free inter-tubes in the river? Every other hotel would have them for free. The hotel is not focused on the customer, only to squeeze as much money as possible out of you. If you want to go to the gym for an hour or so, that is a fee of $ 20 a day. Then, try and go up to their MIX lounge and great food establishment They say you can sit outside for dinner, but get there when it opens and know that they only have about 6 tables out there and even if you make a reservation and request outside that is not going to happen, unless you are there at 6pm when they open. The cost for dinner for four people was $ 500, we had a cheap bottle of wine. My appetizer was $ 28, and my entree was $ 48. The food was good, but not worth it, stays away. Hello, Las Vegas there is a recession on? Or not? This hotel really, \"nickels and dimes\" the customer, very bad!"

    "content": "After reading a lot of reviews of the Mandalay Bay, I was prepared for a not so pleasant experience, but that was not the case. We arrived early evening and check in went well. Our room was on the 34th floor and had a nice view of the pool. Our initial room did have some problems with cleanliness, but after a call to the front desk, we were given a different room which was acceptable. (The locks aparently were programmed from the front desk, so we did not have to go back down.) The rooms were nice, had HD on some channels. The pool, which is the reason we came, met our expectations. We brough our own tubes, which were blown up free of charge. The wave pool, while a bit lame on the \"wave\" part, was satisfactorally deep to actually swim, the side pools were nice for relaxing, and the lazy river was great to just chill. We must have picked a good weekend as the crowds were less than what we anticipated and that was confirmed by the staff that lines and crowded conditions are not unusual. We rented a gazeebo one day, and at $300 was expensive, was worth it as our splurge for the weekend. We were able to lay our for a while, then sit in the shade. The service was good with staff coming by at good intervals to check on us. Be wary of ordereing water at the pool - $8/bottle. There are water coolers at a couple locations, but not easily noticable. We did not try any \"signature\" restaurants, so can't comment on those. Yes, it is on the far end of the strip, but a quick tram to the Excalibur and a walk across the street to the MGM had us by the Deuce, so getting anywhere was not difficult. We would stay there again, if our desire is for a good pool."

    "content": "Stayed at the Mandalay Bay for four nights after Labor Day. Was relatively quiet midweek. We had a reservation for a 750GR smoking. When we checked in soon after 4PM, there were no smoking rooms available, so they gave us a room on a nonsmoking floor that they would have to \"deepclean\" after our visit. Although there was a strong smell of smoke even on our floor. Floor to ceiling windows with a view of the Strip. Spectacular!! Our only tthree complaints were the noise of the suite next to us which we called about finally and the noise shut off soon after. Really not the hotel's fault when Duran Duran is blaring at 3AM! We went to the concierge desk twice to ask about transportation options and also to ask where the business center was to print our boarding passes for the trip back. Both times the staff seemed to be bothered by the intrusion and gave misleading or false information. Also, our room was not cleaned one day. I called to housekeeping for more towels and told them about this, but we did not get a cleaning at all or even an apology when we had been out most of the late morning/afternoon .Stripsteak, one of the high end restaurants, is average at best, certainly not worth the price. Lots of cocktail waitresses on the casino floor for free drinks. The best part is that we won our trip costs back in the casino just playing slots. Join the Players Club. It is linked to lots of casinos on the strip.We were told that some of our charges would be covered by the club, but nothing happened. Will contact customer service to find out what happened. Great beach area with a topless pool that is totally separate from the main pool which has a wave machine. Lazy River is great,also."

    "content": "we've recently spent two nights at the Mb hotel in Vegas. Being it my birthday, we booked as a gift a suite with whirpool. we have been placed at the very top floor and had a nice view of the strip. our room was very big, with a king bed, a bathroom that's twice the size the one i have at home, a big hall with a table and a sofa. We fpound it to be fairly clean. The downsize is that you can't put anything in the fridge because it's only made as a minibar from which you take things. the service we experienced was good, all went well both with the valet parking and the luggage ande the room. I've read some reviews of people who were \"burglared\" in their rooms so we've been extra careful with valuables and luggage. The hotel is located at the very beginning of the strip, which makes it quieter but which also mimplies that you'll have to walk a lot to get to, say, the Venetian. The hotel is huge. It features a casino, two spas, a stunning pool/beach area with serveral pools, various shops and restaurants and an acquarium. I have to say it's overcrowded, especially families with children, and actually it feels like the hotel aims at this very target. The pool area is packed with people. We didn't really care because we've only been there for one day and a half and I spent a whole morning at the spa, but if you want to spend your time sunbathing then you'd better hurry up. I would come back to this hotel anyway, because we struck a very good deal with the room and found the environment to be fine."

    "content": "I've seen the Mandalay Bay get bad reviews here, some for staff issues but we had an issue come up during our visit that showed me the quality of staff in the hotel. Our door handle became loose during our stay making it difficult to get into the room. We reported it and went to breakfast. By the time we got back the engineer was there not only fixing the door handle but surveying the whole room to see if there were any other problems, plus asking us if we had any other issues. Very nice man. Unfortunately later it turned out that not only was the handle a problem but in the meantime the reader went out so we could not get back into the room after the handle was fixed (double whammy!). A maid let us in, we called down for a new door \"key\", one was brought up within minutes by the bellhop, he tried the keys to make sure they worked before he left but they didn't, again very nice staff member. He called the engineer back who arrived in less than 5 minutes, full of apologies. Turned out the reader was dead and the whole thing needed replacing which he did in less than 10 minutes. Once again, he went through the room to make sure nothing else was wrong. Maid service was outstanding, took excellent care of our room everyday, nice folks. Loved eating at the House of Blues for breakfast (use the 2 for 1 coupon in the Las Vegas booklet, once you do that you can use your receipt and come back the next morning for the same deal!!). They have a very friendly staff, right on top of what we needed. Look for Jason in the gift shop, he has an excellent career ahead for him, get with people. The only advice I have is to book a room higher up. If you are on the lower levels catching an elevator at certain times of the day could be a challenge as they fill up. We were on 30 and that was just fine. Loved the pool complex, great place to just be lazy. We would stay here again."

    "date": "September 12, 2009",
    "content": "While we enjoyed our stay here, we have to say it was built with the idea of a guest never leaving in mind (like a cruise ship). There are multiple restaurants on site as well as spas and salons and a wedding chapel. They want you to stay and spend your money there! The rooms weren't sparkling clean, but we had no problems getting clean towels as other reviews have said. We kept our \"recuperating\" sign on the door to keep the hotel service out in the first 24 hours and they actually called to ask if we needed new towels. The hotel staff seemed friendly enough to us, but we went during the week. The only problem we had was at Raffles Cafe. While the food is good the service is horrible! We went twice and the first time, our waiter was just rude. The second time, one of the hostesses had to take our drink order and bring us the bread. They did this after they noticed no waiters had after 15 min!! And there was one standing right by our table the whole time, but he was only paying attention to the 5 golfers at the next table. I guess he wanted the guarantee of the bigger tip, so we got up and left. The buffet food isn't great, it's expensive, it can get packed, and there's no designated start/end to the lines, but the table service is much much better at the buffet. Also, there's a McDonalds right across the street for a quick and cheap bite. The Border Grill was good, but if you just wanting an enchilada or some fajitas, you won't get it here. It's more traditional or experimental mexican food and not what we Americans are familiar with. Their menu also wasn't descriptive enough to know what you were getting when you ordered something, but their pomegranite margarita was pretty good. The casino was relatively clean, but it smelled like a mix of smoke and a pina colada most of the time. I guess that's a scent they pipe in. Also, if you plan to take the tram, beware, it closes down at about 11 although the hours aren't posted anywhere. If you're exhausted at midnight and looking forward to taking the tram back to the hotel, you'll be disappointed and will have to walk back. And if you have the money (about $100 a person) check out the House of Blues Foundation Room for a great view of the city and great food!! It's on the top floor and the entrance is right across from the elevators. Online reviews say this is a private club, but we had no problems getting a reservation. The staff at the Foundation room was also the friendliest. They invited us to explore their place and get lost if we wanted to! It was probably one of the best times we had there. Note, we went during the week so that is probably why we got better service out of the staff. Less people during the week means less drunks running around messing up the room or less people being rude to the staff but expecting to have their butts kissed in return!!! Our only problem was Raffles Cafe!!"

The wave pool is a lot of fun. I can only do so much laying by the pool reading and drinking...So this pool provides the activity I need. The sand is a nice added touch too. Decent selection of restaurants on site and in the connected Mandalay Place. There are 2 Starbucks and a decently priced burger place - Burger Bar. Another added plus - There is a Lush store in Mandalay Place. Go there, buy a 5 dollar bath bomb and enjoy your soaking tub!! The spa is also my favorite in Vegas. It's 30 bucks for a day pass and it's well worth it. You can come and go and relax for hours on end. Two words - Do it."

Best pools on The Strip. The Bad. Rooms have intrconnecting doors which prove to be noisy, as are the corridors with people returning from the Casino at all hours with little regard for others. The Ugly. Whatever deal you strike for room rates ( which can be very competitive and reasonable) watch out for the extras. Drinks at the pool area $8.00 for 1Litre of water, $8.00 for half pint of beer. $16.00 for an omlette and 10 bucks for a burger.Any thoughts of taking your own will be thwarted at the turnstiles, where all bags are searched for food and drink. The pool is advertised as having a wave machine on the Beach that would allow for board riders to surf the waves. Don't hold your breath. Because of insurance issues, the waves are no bigger than a giant ripple, with 8 lifeguards with whistles telling you when to swim, when to surf, when to get out, when to get in,walk,don't walk etc etc. Get there early, people start queing at 8am for the best spots."

The pool was a highlite of our trip, we spend part of 4 different days at the pool. NEVER had a problem getting a chair in just the right area for us. I have seen others on trip advisor complain about not getting a chair. My guess is they came to the beach part of the pool at about 1:00pm when everyone else did. Yes, it was crowded then. Over 21, the bay had an adults only section which would get you a nice chair and no children. The wave pool rocked, actually it threw you all over the place. My 17 year old spent most of the time by the pool body surfing. Service around the beach was top notch and the many life guards were friendly and helpful to everyone. Our room could have used a better view but I guess thats the way it goes. I had a tiny view of the strip, airport and mts on the 30th floor The room was wonderful! Great beds. Clean and very comfortable with great housekeeping services who were attentive to every need. Large bathroom with glass shower, soaking tub and small flat screen tv. Food was great in the restaurants within the hotel. We really liked the noodle shop. We noticed a number of hollywood stars walking around the hotel without body guards. Not sure where all the other complaints come in because our stay was number #1. Oh yes, make sure you see The Lion King. You won't be sorry!"

Plus, we were in the pool most of the time anyway. Hotel staff was great. We requested items from housekeeping twice-both times were delived within 10-15 minutes, with followup calls to make sure we got them.

The beach was a great place to chill away from all the fantastic shopping !!!!! To say the hotel is SO big there never seemed to be hundreds of people about, it was busiest around the pool. We had one incident with some young lads in the room next door with the partying and loud music. We politely asked them to turn it down ( and were no bores) but nothing was done so i called reception. They sent security up within 10 minutes and said the noise level was not acceptable and told them the hotel has a 3 strike policy. The hotel dealt with the situation really well.

    "content": "Beware - This review will focus on the kid stuff. Went to MB August 24-August 27 with husband and 7 year old son. I selected this hotel primarily because it is a luxury hotel witha great price for food included. All of the complaints mentioned by others did not materialize for me. Elevators were fine, furniture/room in top notch shape and staff were pleasant. Check in was a breeze at 1:00 pm on a Monday. It did look very busy at other times. We stayed on the top floor 34th level. We had the $129 special per night room (2 adults) with the all you can eat buffet. Note - Children over 4 must pay $35+tax for breakfast/lunch/dinner deal. Hotel is beautiful and pool is great. Food options will be pricey if you do not buy the $35 buffet deal. FYI - They charge for a fridge in the room - you can not just use the bar fridge. Lobby and room very nice. Beds comfy. TV channels limited - only Nick for kids, no other channels for the kids. Otherwise, take the monorail to Excaliber/NY NY next door and plenty of cheap options. Ny Ny has Coney Island hot dogs, soft pretzels, Jodi Maroni's sausage, good Jewish Delis and good NY pizza. BTW - Tram is not stopping at Luxor at this time. Subway Sandwich is located across the street as well. Reef Aquarium too pricey for me $15 for kids $18 for adults. Check Goldstar Events website for cheap show tickets. Saw Dirk Arthur Magic Show at 4:00pm at the Tropicana. It was fine for the kids. Kind of a low budget production, but for $17 on Goldstar Events website, it was a great deal. Tropicana is very run down - kind of sad as it was really great in the old days. ** Purchase the round tube floaty for lazy river before arriving at hotel if possible. Kind of amazing that they charge $25 to purchase a plastic float that costs .50 cents to make. I purchased mine at Target for $6.00 each before our trip. Ok, my only complaint is that they should not allow people without floats into the lazy river. Other hotels have a strict policy - everyone in lazy river must have a tube float. It is a bit annoying trying to avoid knocking into all of these people. There are 3 large gorgous pools and I don't know why everyone goes in the lazy river. I knocked into a grandma and she looked at me in a ticked off manner. Lazy rivers are designed for tube floating not swimmers. Wave pool was fun - son enjoyed it. I was always able to get chairs at pool. I went at 12 noon and 3pm. Gameworks next to M&M factory is great for the kids, very good arcade - a step above the average. Good for an evening out with the kids. Circus Circus is very far, you will need to take a cab or drive. It is good for the kids, pretty old and dumpy but the kids love it. Walgreens and CVS not too far, you can reach via monorail and a 2 block walk to get snacks. Rainforest Cafe in MGM (also reachable via monorail) great for the kids. Check website for menu. Work out room in hotel is $20 per day. Internet is $15 per day. But, there is no resort fee so that is a plus. The Summer heat is very rough. Think true desert! Even at 9pm we were sweating it was 90 degrees with no breeze. Keep this in mind. Streets tend to be empty during the day. Weather is intolerable."

    "content": "In May of 2008, we went to Las Vegas and were booked to stay at Mandalay Bay. We plan our trips far in advance due to our work schedules. Upon arrival, after a 4 hour flight, we arrive at Mandalay Bay. A teenager with no identifying information stops us as we enter, asks us our names and directs us to another desk. The clerk then tells us they are overbooked and we are going to the MGM. So, I asked her, \" Are you asking us to move or are you telling us we can't stay here?\" She said, \"You can't stay here.\" So, with my detailed notes in hand, I wrote a letter upon my return to the MGM CEO with the clerk's name and our experience. MGM owns almost every hotel on the strip. We did not want to stay at the MGM. We go to LV 1-2 times per year at least and we pick what hotel we want to vacation in each year. At no time in the 6 months since we booked did Mandalay Bay call and tell us they were overbooked. We would have stayed somewhere else or they at least could have given us a choice of where to stay at one of their several hotels rather than the MGM. Nothing like having your vacation decided for you upon arrival! However, there is a good side to this story. The MGM CEO responded to my (polite) letter about our May 2008 vacation and offered us a free 3 day stay at Mandalay Bay. They totally redeemed themselves. Not because it was free, but because we asked for nothing and they responded promptly, apologized AND offered us a free hotel for three nights. Impressive, really. We simply wanted to make them aware of the poor service. On our return trip to Mandalay Bay, we had a VIP check in (delightful) and a gorgeous room overlooking the strip. The room was gorgeous. @ flat screen tv's. One huge one by the bed and one smaller one in the bathroom, which was great when getting ready. More hotels need to do that. The hotel staff and the hotel itself were lovely to us the second go around. We will definitely stay here again. It was a class operation the 2nd time around. However, should you ever be bumped, take notes of employee names and conversations. Any reputable business would want to at least know if their customers were being treated poorly. We love their casino. It is one of our favorites. Do go to the Gospel Brunch at The House of Blues. I love their Eggs Benedict. Good prices, lots of food. We also love the Burger Bar, owned by Chef Hubert Keller. A great, upscale burger joint that LV needs more of. They also have a great Mexican restaurant owned by 2 Food Network chefs. The name escapes me, but it is in the hotel and it was great. It overlooks the pool's waterway (where people lazily tube downstream) and \"beach\"."

Room was OK size and it was in good condition, no complaints at all. I would definitely stay again. We ate at Raffles Cafe twice, the breakfast was definitely worth. Drinks at the Mix is also highly recommended. On to the hiccups: Elevators were definitely slow. We figured out that getting on the casino level can take forever. However, if you go down to the pool level, you are bound to get to your room much quicker. Elevators seemed to be a bit confused at times and they simply passed the casino level, even though we knew there were dozens of people waiting. There are a lot of kids at MB, and a lot of them were still milling about after midnight. The pool area is very crowded with families. We ended up going up to Moorea Beach Club and paying for entrance, but it was definitely worth it."

    "content": "Nice spacious room with comfy bed and sitting/work area... though window sills and chair rails were a bit dusty and bathroom was poorly ventilated. TV in the bathroom was a nice touch but a remote control would have been nice so you could switch channels from the tub. Check in at 8pm friday night was a breeze- no wait at all...only 3 check in lines open but more weren't needed at that time. However we saw long lines at other times and still only 3-4 check in lines open. Elevators were insane. Seemed like only 1 was running at a time. We were on the 5th floor and trying to catch a ride down we would have to wait for 3 or 4 cars as they were all jam packed full of people going down. I wondered if they are trying to save money by running less cars? Escalators all over MB and most other MGM properties were either all broken or turned off the whole weekend we were there...again I wondered if these were cost cutting measures, or if they are just saving by not fixing broken stuff? Pool was nice but was extremely crowded for an overcast day...I hate to think what it would have been like if it had been a nice sunny day. We went midmorning and couldn't find a chair for 30 minutes. Never did find the lazy river but when I saw that inner tubes were for sale for $26, not rentals so I decided to skip that. Buffet had a huge wait line but lots of empty seats inside, seems they didn't have enough people to clear tables or seat guests...understaffed? All in all a nice stay with a few minor drawbacks. Like everything else it seems they are cutting corners due to the economy and its apparent. But for the deals they have its well worth the inconvenience of having to wait for an elevator for a stay in a nice room."

    "content": "My 14 year old son chose this hotel because of the pool, and he wasn't disappointed. The lazy river is great - it moves pretty fast, and the optional tubes weren't too expensive. The wave pool is fine. I'm interested to see other reviewers said it used to be dramatic. It's a pity it was cut back - they seemed very concerned that everyone stood in exactly the right place, although the waves were pretty small. The pool area is busy. There were no chairs available when we got there, but there are sandy areas where you can put a towel. There is also an adult only pool so you can escape the kids. The hotel is huge and a bit impersonal. We didn't see any staff after check-in, but then we didn't need to. The room was great - no problems with tired decor or lack of cleanliness referred to by other reviewers. We were on a low floor (don't like heights) so maybe they don't get as much use. There was lots of room, with two large beds and two TVs - my son wanted to take a bath just to watch the TV in the bathroom. The toilet was separate. Everything was spotless. My only complaint was that it was a bit dark. Hotels everywhere have replaced old type bulbs with CFLs, and ignored the fact that the light isn't as good. The Mandalay needs to add some more lights. It would be very difficult to work here. The casino wasn't very busy, but typically huge. It was at least a 10 min walk from the main lobby to the convention centre and the aquarium. We There is a free monorail to the Luxor (down at end of July) and Excalibur, which is a short walk to the MGM where you can take the regular monorail (1 day ticket is good value). The monorail runs behind the strip, so good for getting places, but not for sight seeing from the train. There is also a poorly signposted walkway between Mandalay and the Luxor, useful as the free monorail stops around 10.30 pm. The Mandalay is right at the south end of the strip, obvious as soon as the plane lands. It is a very nice hotel, but for future visits I think we'd like somewhere a bit more \"tacky\" and less low key (Paris and New York, New York look the part)."

    "content": "We drove to Vegas from So. Cal in order to take advantage of good flight on regional carrier to MidWest and stayed at MB for 2 nights. We really enjoyed the pool. My kids were too short for the wave pool, but really I think they could've been in the wave pool because it was quite tame (no big waves at all). They had a toddler pool next to the wave pool that the kids enjoyed. But what we really enjoyed was the lazy river which really goes at a nice clip. We didn't use inflatables and still had a great time. Stayed in it for hours. I recommend pool shoes as I cut my big toes on the bottom while helping my daughter with the current. We ate b-fast at Raffles and found the specilaty pancakes to be a bit dry and overpriced. We made a large mistake eating at Georgios where we ordered an olive pizza that was so salty it was unpalatable. The wait staff didn't even care when we didn't touch it and left it on the table. I find people interested in service actively ask stuff about your experience, but it cost us a lot to eat there and they didn't seem to care. Self parking was a little hard to figure out. We wanted to do valet parking but it really was busy and they didn't have room in the check in area to help us, so I went to self parking which you have to go around a few corners to find. But once we figured out where to go through the casino to get to parking it was convenient. We did the aquarium which was fun and the kids enjoyed the hands-on parts but besides the pool, there wasn't anything for the kids to do. We drove down to Circus Circus where we spent way too much money on the carnival games. Our room at MB was fine with two queen beds on the 34th floor. No real trouble with elevators and our view of the Vegas airport was awesome. We enjoyed seeing all the traffic helicopters take off and planes come in. We could also see the pool areas. In sum, we really don't like taking our kids to Vegas because of too much cigarette smoke and body art, etc, etc, but we had to to catch an early AM flight. If you don't have kids, I think you will have about a good a time as any of the hotels on the strip. People who rented cabanas by the pool seemed to enjoy the fact that they could get out of the sun. Most people seemed to have a great time and they have lots of interesting bars/restaurants as do all the major hotels. But, skip the pizza. Gross!"

    "content": "We stayed at Mandalay Bay from Sunday, 8-16-09 to Friday, 8-21-09. I, my wife and two kids (8 and 4) had the 550 sq foot room on the 34th floor with a view of the pools. We paid $89.99 per night for 5 nights. I believe it was hot summer nights promotion we received via email from the MGM Mirage Corp. The room had 2 very comfortable queen beds, 3 phones (one next to toilet, one next to the beds, and a cordless phone on the desk), 2 flat screen tvs (42\u201d Phillips in the room and smaller one in the bathroom). This is their standard room which to us seemed like a suite! Good luck finding a standard room with 2 queen beds in another hotel. Most have 2 double/full size beds in their basic rooms. Housekeeping: Our room was made up each day sometime between 1:00pm and 3:00pm. No problems with the housekeeping service at all. Pools: Probably the best pools in Vegas and I have stayed at most of the major hotels in the last 10 years. Make sure to bring your own intertube/float for the \u201clazy river\u201d because it will cost you 20-30 bucks to purchase one on site. If you bring a child who is at or slightly above 48\u201d, make sure to have one of the lifeguards put a wrist band on the child. Height requirement for the wave pool is 48\u201d and there are no intertubes/floats allowed in the wave pool. Many of the reviews on here have stated the wave pool is overrated. Well, if you are expecting to use a boogie board (sp?) or surf board, you need to go to the ocean instead of the Mandalay Bay pools. Yes the waves come about every 2 minutes or so. The lifeguards are strict in the wave pool, but it\u2019s for our safety and the hotel\u2019s liability. My children loved the pools and can\u2019t wait to visit again. Those of you looking for some quiet R&R need to look for a different pool at a different hotel. Parents and children were everywhere. The pools were open from 8 AM to 7 PM. You must get to the pools at 8 AM to find the lawn chairs of your choice, otherwise good luck finding one until the late afternoon. We brought our own bottled water with us into the pool area, but you cannot bring any cans, glass bottles, or food. Elevators: There has been much discussion on here regarding the elevators. It seemed like the elevators for floors 17-34 were much busier than elevators for floors 2-16. Depending on the time of day, the elevators could be fast or slow. Between 4 pm and 7 pm is busy because people are leaving the pool area to return to their rooms, also many people are going to dinner. Other reviewers on trip advisor mention 15-20 minute wait times, but we did not experience anything that long. Lobby/Check-in/Check-out: When you enter the lobby there is a nice scent which you don\u2019t get at other hotels. Check in was long for us, but that\u2019s because some guy had all kinds of issues which held up the line. Not the hotels fault, I just chose the wrong line to check in. All of the others lines were moving quickly. Check out was a breeze. Used the video tv checkout in our room, called for the bell desk guy to come get our 7 bags, he arrived within minutes of calling. Casino: I played penny slots, nickel slots and single deck blackjack ($15 minimum) and had good success in all areas. Won enough money to pay for a nice dinner at rum jungle for entire family! Make sure to sign up for the MGM Mirage Players Club, if you haven\u2019t already, so you can get even more perks. The Casino was spacious and not crowded. Yes, all the action is in the middle of the Strip, but I liked being away from the masses at the south end of the Strip where MB is located. Problems: The Deli in the Sports Book area does NOT sell food to children! The sports book is considered a gaming area and I couldn\u2019t buy food \"to go\" for me and my family. Maybe if it was just me purchasing food at the deli with no other family members in sight, they might have sold me some food. It was late and we were in a hurry to get some food so we tried this deli. Ended up going to Raffles Caf\u00e9 instead. In conclusion, my family had a fantastic stay and will be staying here again during our next trip to Vegas! Mandalay Bay is the new Disneyland, so I suggest adult couples stay elsewhere in Vegas if you really can\u2019t stand kids."

First impression was a little disappointing as the outside of the double doors into our suite were dirty with handprints or food or something. The room itself was very spacious 2 bedrooms and two baths with a living area in between. Both bathrooms smelled of urine, unfortunately. I got clorox wipes and cleaned the toilets and floors around the base of the toilet myself. There were some leftover pieces of streamers still taped to the ceiling from the previous guests. Also at the dining room table there were only 3 chairs instead of 4. The beds were well made and comfy. The furniture was quite worn but adequate. The jacuzzi tub and shower were nice. One of the bedrooms was always too warm no matter how we adjusted the controller which was extremely annoying. Those are all the negatives. Now for the positive: Never heard a peep out our neighbors. When we call room service/repair they were there promplty. The view of the pool and partial strip were spectacular. My children had a fantastic time at the wave pool and lazy river. The lobby and public areas were pleasant and gave a real feeling of relaxation. Most employess were enthusiatic and friendly. Never had to much of a wait for the elevators unlike other people on TA. Overall, I will probably stay here again with or without my kids because I like being away from the strip craziness and because of the amazing pools. Be sure to see Shark Reef. It was great!! Would have enjoyed with or with the kids. Do walk over to Luxor to eat cheap. They have food court with pizza, McD's and sandwiches, etc. The Bayside Buffet was nice. Casino was a little smokey but never smelled smoke in nonsmoking room. Bring your own inner tubes for the lazy river or be willing to pay 25-30 bucks for one. Oh yes, and there were many, many families with kids, its true. Most kids I encountered were well behaved and just enjoying time with their fams. Didn't see any kids after 9 or 10pm, though. I give this Hotel a B- just because our room was a little worn and the bathrooms could have been cleaner."

ROOMS: My only complaints was that maid service only came to clean our rooms and freshen our towels on 3 out of the 6 days were stayed here. The worst part was that the linens (towels & bed sheets) were dingy and not very clean for such a nice hotel (don't get me wrong, I was not disgusted enough not to stay there ever again. I was just very disappointed that such a nice room in a nice hotel could have such dingy linens). Besides the linens & maid service, the room was spacious, well appointed & quiet (maybe we didn't have any neighbors?). The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was clean, spacious, and well designed. POOLS: I loved that we had many different pools to choose from. Our favorite was the wave pool at the BEACH and the lazy river. The lazy river was a lot of fun even without a tube to float on (we didn't want to pay to get a floation device, so we just floated around on our backs). Beware - the pools & the lazy rivers can get very crowded very fast. So I would recommend to go early or late. The poolside staff was friendly. I was not traveling with kids but I think children would LOVE the pools here. FOOD & FUN: Shanghai Lilly was our favorite restaurant- the food was very good, decently priced, friendly staff. The Noodle Shop was decent (but not worth the price). Raffles cafe had good breakfasts. Mix was trendy and expensive (which some people like). The view from Mix (which is located on the top floor of THE hotel) was wonderful. We went up to see it early in the day before the evening crowds started to pour in for when Mix turns into a nightclub/lounge. LOCATION: The Mandalay Bay is located at the South End of the Strip next to the Luxor. We still managed to walk everywhere (but we've got young legs being 22 & 28) and occasionally took a taxi. We also used the tram which connects Mandalay to the Luxor & Excalibur."

    "content": "I went over a long weekend with a group of guys and we stayed two nights at Mandalay Bay. This was my 9th trip out to Vegas and we always have enjoyed the Casino, clubs and restaurants at Mandalay Bay so combined with the glowing reviews of the pool we were all excited. As you can probably guess from my title, things are not always as they appear. Check-in went well. They seemed to move people through the line pretty quickly and we were even able to get our rooms a little early which is always nice. Our room was nice but it was obvious that the shower had not been cleaned in a while and had a pretty bad funk to it. I also question if the beds were actually made because it looked like my attempts at making a bed rather than a professional. At any rate the biggest complaint about the rooms is that the walls are paper thin. The adjoining room to us had several kids that would scream and run around the room every morning at 8am or so. Mind you these were not little kids, probably about 10-12. We called the front desk twice and I believe security came up to talk to them because at least the hallway running stopped. I know that can be an isolated incident and isn't really the hotel's fault but it speaks to the culture of what the hotel has become. For some reason the room also never got below 74 which was annoying given how hot it was outside. The thing you never really hear about is that Mandalay Bay has become the new \"it\" hotel for families with kids. Hey I have nothing against kids, I have two under the age of 3 myself, so I have a lot of patience and empathy for parents traveling with kids. That said, part of why I go to Vegas is to relax and enjoy the pool scene. Now mind you that many pool scenes in Vegas have become ridiculous because in light of tough economic times they put out far too few lounge chairs in an attempt to sell their overpriced and unimpressive cabanas. The notion that you have to get to pools by 10am to get spots or pay an extra $250 at many hotels these days is just an unfortunate reality. Again though nothing could prepare me for how packed with kids Mandalay's pool scene was. I understand that the wave pool and lazy river would be a draw but I have never been to a pool in Vegas where it is around 70% kids and 30% adults. Usually it is about 90/10 the other way (I have stayed at 7 hotels) So needless to say that finding chairs was impossible and nothing about the scene was relaxing. Overall I would just say that Mandalay Bay is a good place to visit at night, eat at or bring your family to if that's your thing. I have no problem with that and it makes sense given that they own Excalibur so perhaps they should put in a Nascar restaurant or WWE grill there too. It just sort of makes me sad because it used to be regarded as one of the hotels worth being at for people traveling without kids looking for an upscale adult scene (though I will say that the Foundation Room is still worth the trip). Next time we will go back to the middle of the strip or try something new like the Encore or Venetian. Happy travels!"

    "content": "I have traveled to Las Vegas on many occassions and stayed at most of the major hotels. I would rate Mandalay bay as average compared with others on the strip. The room was modest size. Decor was OK. Bathroom was large, modern, well appointed with two sinks in a granite top counter. Shower was large with pebble floor. toilet was in separate closet. Bath was separate. Room was very clean and well maintained. AC worked very well (it was about 117 F outside so this is important). I would agree with others that the beds are probably ready to be replaced, however I had no trouble sleeping. Noise level was very low. Our first room had a view of the pool from the 34th floor. I disagree with others that this view is not ideal. The desert, airport and pool are fine views. Our second room had a view of the strip. Night lights were great to sit and watch. The casino area was very open and relatively quite despite lots of guests. Other hotels it can get very congested. Restaurants were fair only with some sizable lines even during weekdays. Pools were as described. Very crowded but no more than a popular beach. I understand the concern of some of the reviewers about the careful monitoring by life guards but understand that Las Vegas visitors can sometimes get out of hand so I can understand the hotel's concern. The REAL BIG problem is the engineering of the hotel elevators. I thought some of the reviewers were exagerating regarding the long lines for elevators. I cannot say I have ever seen anything like this in a modern hotel. There were about eight elevators going up to one set of floors in a narrow hallway and another eight to another set of floors. The elevators were very quick to open and close so guests often pushed each other to quickly get into an elevator, often before guests disembarked. It was rare not to see a long line and it was pretty annoying. The real trick is getting your luggage down if you are on anything but the highest floors (i.e., have first crack at an empty elevator). The hotel is indeed located at the end of the strip and walking in extreme heat (which we did) can take the energy out. But keep in mind that all the hotels and casinos in Las Vegas have ample, free parking so you can always take your car. For those that have no patience waiting on Las Vegas blvd in traffic there are many side streets. There is also a sort of monorail running behind many of the hotels. Overall, it was an OK hotel. I would recommend to families with kids as the pool is really the best I have seen in Las Vegas. The rooms are certainly clean, adequate and can often be obtained at a discounted rate."

    "content": "We stayed here 19th to 24th of July this year. Overall we enjoyed the stay and would definitely recommend! We arrived on the Sunday (around 3pm) and used the valet and bellhop. Check in was very quick (5-10mins max compared with much longer personal experiences at Luxor, PH and NYNY). Check-in staff were efficient and quickly dealt with the two bookings we and friends had made. Once in the room it was spacious and clean, large comfy king bed, desk, armchair, flat-screen TV, mini-bar etc everything one would expect. View was of THEhotel, on the 23rd floor so wasn\u2019t too bad a view. Bathroom was large and clean, his and hers sinks, large bath and large separate shower, the bathroom had an opaque window to the passage between the door and the room which I thought was a nice feature. And the bellhop was up in no time after I rang with our room number. The lifts to the rooms were all ways very busy and waits were fairly regular. Not much of a gambler so can\u2019t really comment on the casino but was great fun on the few occasions I lost money! The casino floor never looked as busy as others on the strip, the hotel in general looked well maintained in a colonial/SE Asian sort of style, with a nice orangey scent everywhere, lots of convention people wondering through the hotel made it busy at times and there did seem to be a lot of young families, mostly on-route to or from the beach (I personally didn\u2019t go, our travel mates did and said it was great but busy). We ate at; Raffles Caf\u00e9, which was fairly standard nothing special; the Bayside Buffet which was varied, fresh and enjoyable; Red, White & Blue, a great place to people watch but nothing special. We also ate at Mix in THEhotel which was fantastic, review will be posted!"

Because you are at the end of the strip, you are stuck for meals unless you plan in advance to eat out or you wait for the staff to seat you in one of their empty tables after waiting in a long line. Also, the place is extensively \"a-la-carte\". Even the lazy river doesn't come with a tube! Expect to pay nearly $30 to buy a tube and then carry it with you everywhere so it doesn't get stolen. Just as another example, it cost us $17 to print our boarding passes from their \"customer friendly terminal\" , $14 a day for internet access in our room and $30 just to enter the spa. If you're not a smoker, you will not appreciate the thick aroma of smoke throughout the hotel."

I have stayed in Vegas before, and the Monte Carlo is a million times better and less $. The bed at Mandalay was the worst bed I have ever slept on in my life. We complained, and they put a bed board under the mattress - that did no good. We told the staff, and they said that was all they could do. Then, we stayed for a total of 3 nites, and every nite we were awoken to fighting in the room next to us. Slamming doors, screaming voices, things being thrown against the wall. These fights would go on for hours- we would call the front desk, and the told us thank you for letting them know and that was all we could do. The beach chairs get mysteriously hidden the night before, so that only certain people can find them (we were not one of them) so chairs are highly hard to find. The lazy river was so over crowded I was constantly kicked by people's feet and just ended up leaveing the river. The \"wave\" pool was.... pathetic to say the least. One tiny wave every 5 minutes does not equal a wave pool. Next time we will not be staying here."

    "content": "Too bad to see so many poor reviews. My wife and I just returned from a trip, Monday August 3rd to Friday August 7th, and we had a wonderful time (we have previously stayed at Venetian, Rio, and MGM). We arrived at noon on Monday and were definitely surprised to see how many people were checking in. They do need to work on a better system but it wasn't that big of a deal and we were checked-in within 15-20 minutes. Very happy to see that our room was ready as requested and the staff was very helpful. The elevator system does need some work as well - so expect to have a little delay (3-4 minutes) if you are going to your room in the morning. The room was nice, very comfortable bed, and was clean. We were there for relaxation so our day usually consisted of sleeping in and then heading to the pool at about 11:00 or 11:30 each day. The main pool (the wave pool) was always crowded but we never had a problem finding two lounge chairs together after a very brief look-around. Definitely a ton of kids - but it is a WAVE POOL - so that does attract kids and those families. The lazy river was always packed, but everyone seemed to have a good attitude. One day we went to the South Pool and this was way quieter, had a good bar area, and more adult oriented - so that would be a good option if you want to get away from the crowd. Yes, drinks are expensive but ITS VEGAS - drinks are expensive everywhere unless you are gambling. We did have some of the best mojitos we have ever had at one of the pool bars (talk to Freddie - he won best Mojito in Vegas in 2006). The restaurants at Mandalay Bay are all very nice and there are some cheaper alternatives (Raffles Cafe, etc.) if you want something more relaxing. We ate the Red/White/Blue Bistro and had a good lunch for not too bad of a price. Definitely try the Burger Bar for good food and a great selection of beer (Deschutes Brewery!). All in all, we had a very relaxing trip and will definitely return. Just realize that (a) it will be crowded, (b) there are kids there, and (c) the drinks/food/entertainment can be expensive. Oh yeah, and it will be HOT if you go June - August but if you hang out at the pool it doesn't feel that bad. It was 108 one day we were there and we were at the pool from noon to 3pm no problem. Also, just take a taxi to the middle of the strip or the clubs/etc. if you can because its way quicker, convenient - but it can add up as well. So go to Vegas to have a good time and don't be uptight; just enjoy yourself."

I stayed from Fri-Sunday and even though it was busy, it wasn't overwhelming as I had expected. The staff members are very attentive and sincere. I checked in very late on friday night and was shocked to hear they overbooked, however they upgraded me to the spacious 750 sqft suite which was great! I love the TV in the bathroom. The beach area was bit crowded at 9am on Sunday but i was still able to get a chair and the lazy river wasn't as busy as expected. Only thing that sucked was that we have to buy the tubes since we can't rent them. They should let people rent! I lost my credit card and Drivers Lic in the lazy river, but someone was very kind and turned it in. Plus Mandalay Staff members were very helpful in aiding me on my search. Pros: the hotel is beautiful, comfortable, clean, spacious and not as crowded as other hotels. Staff members are very friendly. Entertainment is great - loved the beach pool area, Lion King the Musical and the shark reef. Cons: thing was that the food was pricey there. They need to have a cheap food court or something. Beach area can get crowded at times and they should let people rent flotation tubes instead of forcing us to purchase them. Hotel room annoyance: I can hear people from the other side of the adjacent door room. I used the sofa cushions to block out the sound."

    "content": "I stayed here from 8-2 to 8-6, I booked the hotel online and it was fairly inexpensive at $65 a night. We all wanted to stay there anyway so with the discounted rate we were all very excited for the trip. When we got there on Sunday around 11am the lobby was mobbed with a ton of people checking out, however they were able to accomodate us and had 2 out of the 3 rooms ready. The front desk employees were very friendly upon check in and also when I checked out 4 days after. The pool, for which I heard is one of the best pools is vegas, was so outrageously crowded it was ridiculous. There were so many families with children and most parents did not watch there children. Several of us woke up early each morning to get to the pool before it opened to wait in line just so we could get a chair within the pool complex. It was disappointing that you had to get in line before 8 am just to get a chair!! I personally think the pool complex was overrated. The wave pool was pretty lame, you couldn't just stand by the edge because the guards made you either step out of the pool or go into the pool so you can ride the wave in. The lazy river was okay. It was terribly over crowded. If you wanted to use a tube for the lazy river you had to buy one which I believe were around $17 for a small one and over $30 for a larger one (more suitable for an adult). I would suggest if you you do not want to pay that price bring one deflated from home since we had no luck finding a float tube in any of the nearby gift shops, cvs, or convenient shops. Mandalay bay is at one end of the strip and it wasn't as easy to navigate around as we had been told by previous travelers. It was also 100 degrees or more outside and you didn't necessarily want to walk everywhere all the time. We did buy a monorail pass for 3 days thinking we would use it but we did not end up getting our money's worth. I would suggest taking taxis and ask them to take the freeway/highway or back roads to get to your destination. If they stay on the strip it takes longer because of the traffic and therefore the fare will be higher. The hotel room itself was decent and more spacious than many other hotel rooms I have stayed at. I would only recommend this hotel to families. If I were to ever go back to vegas I would try to stay in the middle of strip at Treasure Island, Bellagio, or somewhere around there. You may pay more money but you will be in walking distance to more attractions."

    "content": "I would stay again at Mandalay Bay (MB). Yes, there were some negatives (described below) but many positives. As with anything in life, you always have complainers no matter what is done, evident by reading some of the posts of this hotel. In a nut shell, for our expectations and trip needs/plans, we have many more good things to say (pool, room cleanliness, housekeeping response, spacious room, flat screen tv, bathroom tv, glassed-in shower, separate tub, comfortable bed) than negatives (slow elevators, kids / baby strollers everywhere, could not cool room enough for me). Spacious casino with many craps tables and good dealers. Only restaurant at this hotel we ate at was Burger Bar (recommended). We stayed Thurs July 30 thru Monday Aug 2. We never stayed here before and we knew that this was the hotel at the southern tip of the \u2018strip\u2019 but we still booked our room here. I got a really good deal thru MGM casino marketing, so we took them up on this offer. During past Vegas trips we played in MB casino and found this place to be really nice and upscale. I always rent a car during our Vegas trips, so being this far south on the \u2018strip\u2019 and getting around was not an issue. Plenty of parking in the garage and did not have to walk far to the elevators. We arrived a little after 1:00pm; check-in is advertised as not until 3pm. But they were checking people in and many people behind the counter to check guests in. We did not have to wait at all. Lady was very friendly and quickly got us our keys. Off to the room we went and changed into pool clothes and went to the pool. This hotel has a really nice pool set up. They have a big wave pool with sand beach. But a zillion kids all over the place, so we decided to go to one of the smaller pools. Maybe 2-3 kids here. We walked around to find a chair, and luckily found two. But by 3:30pm, many people left and a lot of chairs open. I can not handle sitting in the sun, so I went to a shaded area into the pool. The crowd was calm at this pool. Not a bunch of dudes trying to pick up chics and acting like dushe-bags yelling Vegas-baby!!. A more mature crowd, but people were partying, but were not annoying. We left about 6pm and still a good crowd, but not overwhelming. Much more mature pool crowd than Flamingo, Bally\u2019s and others know to be a place to party and trying to get lucky. Thursday was the only day we were at the pool; we had other plans during our trip. I checked my bill via the video check-out and everything was correct. They comped me some food and one night fare (so only paid for one night total). I could not check out via the video checkout due to some problem with the system, so just used the express check-out in the lobby. The only bad things to say about this hotel were: the elevators were slow, the cooling system just could not get the room cool enough for me, and $20 a day for the workout center. We had to call housekeeping Thursday because they only left two towels and washcloths, the tv remote was busted, and the iron was not working. But they were at our room within 10 mins with replacements. I believe a zillion kids were at MB due to really good hotel room rates going on in Vegas now (but Vegas is not a family destination), hotel is away from the main Vegas party scene (thus good for the family), and really good pool conditions. I would stay at the Mandalay Bay hotel again, but we plan to stay at another hotel we never stayed at before (Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, Wynn) during our next Vegas trip."

None of us had ever stayed at Mandalay Bay before, and were really looking forward to it. Unfortunately, I, at least, found the resort to be pretty disappointing. First impression of the resort was pretty good. We were able to check in early, around 11 AM. Room looked great. Two nice beds, a huge bathroom with a separate tub and shower. After that, it went pretty much downhill. We never could figure out how to cool the room down. We had the thermostat at about 60 degrees, and the actual air temp in the room had no connection to that whatsoever. One thing I could not believe was that no one from housekeeping came to clean our room the whole time we were there! Now, we had our \"Do Not Disturb\" out sign out a little later in the morning, but come on, a resort that purports to be top of the line doesn't come back later when that sign is down to make up the room? Totally unacceptable. The biggest disappointment to me was the much touted pool area. It was large and nice, yes, but completely and utterly full of screaming kids and teenagers. Yes, when I stay at a snazzy Vegas resort, what I really want to do is walk around the pool area for 20 minutes waiting for some kid to vacate his beach chair. I was pretty fed up with Mandalay Bay by the time we had to checkout, and then trying to checkout pretty much cemented my decision that I will never stay there again. For some reason, our video checkout was disabled in our room. I tried calling the front desk to ask them to activate the video checkout, and after a few minutes of no one picking up, I gave up and went downstairs to check out with a live person. Too bad that the front desk downstairs was understaffed, and after waiting a few minutes, I determined I never would get to talk to a live person about checkout before we needed to catch a cab back to the airport. So, I filled out the Express Checkout card and dropped it into a container by the front desk. Very frustrating, but not surprising for a hotel that didn't even provide housekeeping service to our room. We had a couple of meals at the hotel at the House of Blues (mediocre food, decent price and service) and the Buffet. (mediocre food, expensive and stuffed to the gills with those kids and teenagers I mentioned earlier). One thing that was very cool at the resort was the Foundation Room, up at the very top of the resort. It was a $20 cover for guys, but it had a very cool vibe, nice folks, (a Vegas club that wasn't even snooty!) and an incredible view. But, in terms of the resort itself, next time I want to try another higher end resort that perhaps doesn't have the kids all over the place, (as has probably been asked a gazillion times - why do you bring your kids to Vegas? - I thought that experiment had been declared over) like the Wynn, (or the new Encore - wow, that place looks absolutely beautiful) Venetian or Bellagio."

The casino was good and most of the dealers were very nice. The club MIx on top of THE Hotel is definitly a must see. My only negatives for the stay were the distance from Mandaly bay to other casinos like cesars. Also I don't get the fascination with the pools here. There is a wave pool, but as adult aren't we really past that? I ended up at the south lagoon pool which had its own abr and was bigger that the east and west pools. Also it can take up to 10 mins to get an elevator if you are above floor 17. Your better off walking down to 16 and getting one there as they operate off a different group of elevators"

Beautiful hotel and it smells like a beach and fresh fruit....I love the smell that hits you the minute you walk inside....Check in was short, we did check in around 9pm so not a busy time I guess, room was great, there were 4 of us sharing a room, all girls and the double sinks in the bathroom was fabulous. This hotel is one of the first on the strip so it really is a long walk to anywhere else on the strip, but we did use the free tram between Luxor & Excalibur, however we did cut thru Mandalay place and walked to Luxor a few time as the Tram was not stopping at the Luxor after our first night. Everything within the hotel was pricey, but to be expected from a posh hotel and Vegas itself....The Starbucks was also ridiculous, coffee prices were not bad but $3.50 - $4.00 for a muffin is a little crazy! The pool area is great, yes it does get busy but we were able to find seats and one day we did not make it to the pool till noon, so it's not impossible to find seats, you just have to look.....We stayed on the 7th floor, which unfortunately had a crappy view, also there was a big steele barracade outside the window which really did nothing for the already bad view, but whatever, we barely stayed in the room, also the elevators up to our floor seemed to be the least busy, which was alright.....Housekeeping woke us up a few times...Who cleans a room at 8:30 in the morning in Vegas?? Aside from that, I really liked the MB...But next time I would give a more central hotel a try, Bellagio or Venetian maybe..."

Seriously who brings their children to Las Vegas? I went to Vegas to attend my sisters wedding, relax and party, not to get my pretty pedicured toes stepped on by some booger faced kid with a hot pink inflatable... I mean COME ON. I thankfully read reviews of the hotel before we went so I was well aware of the insanity at the pool area. We went down at about 830 to get our chairs by the pool in the back. By 930, pure chaos. People searching aimlessly for chairs to lounge in. Would I stay here again..... NO you can get soooo much more bang for your buck elsewhere!

The bad: I don't know if the hotel cut back staff during the recession, but there were long lines for practically everything. Check-in took over 20 minutes. Getting the car out of valet at check-out took 25 minutes. A coffee at the downstairs snack shop also took 15 minutes despite the very short line. We skipped the shark exhibit - also due to long lines. The wave pool was good, but my kids didn't like the rules (nobody under 48\" allowed, and not allowed to 'loiter' in the wave breaking area). Bottom line - I'd come here again if I could get the same room. I'd just have to be a little more patient."

We're early thrities and although we stayed in a different but still nice resort we definitley thought Mandalay was to be our next trip. Luckily it was sooner than later and we went early July with two other couples of similar age. All of us leaving the kids at home. We were there mid-week which made the flights and hotel package cheap. (Where in western Cnada but live close enoguh to cross the border and fly within the US) The MB is a little off the strip at the end but with the amazing beaches and pools we never really felt the need to leave MB. Pretty much al lthe reviews I've seen have a bit of truth but we'd stil lgo back. Yes the lifegaurds are stricked at times but not so much in the back pools. The cement is hot and there is little shade but in the pool it was all good. We never really had trouble with drinks around the pool neither. We did buy drinks in the pool and it was expensive $32/bucket of 5 beers but people were clearly bringing their own alcohol in all day. They search your bag but really are just looking for glass. I wouldn't try to bring in a case or anything. My suggestion. Sneak a few in or what ever your drinking. Buy one/two to keep me happy and re-use your ie bucket. (There's two beer/wine stores just accross the street). It's not a cheap hotel but few on the strip are from what we saw. Check out 'the Mix' on top of 'the hotel', great lounge but there was cover and a dress code after a certain time but it had a great view of the strip and the dinner was pretty good; Not that we are fine dining experts. There's a Mcdonalds and subway by the beer stores and there was lots of cheaper places in the Luxor/Excaliber.... There are cheaper options if you want. If money doesn't bother you though the MB has everything. just don't use the phone in your room for long distance or use an ATM. We really didn't have much to be negative about. We loved our room, service was good. value was acceptable to good for what you got. options were great. Casino seemed clean. Lightlife wasn't the best but was definitley okay for what we wanted. Elevators were busy in the mornings but outside of that the waits were minimal to none at all. It's also the closest to the airport so was only about a $13 cab ride back to the airport. Bottom line is we'd go back, we had no issues and would definitley recommend it to anyone. Especially if you want nice pools and beaches."

    "content": "I really wanted to love Mandalay Bay, mainly because I know I have to stay there again at least 2 more times this year. Unfortunately, my experience was a disaster! I arrived at Mandalay Bay at about 8PM on Sunday night. When I got to check in, I found out that you have to \"choose a line\" to stand in. There is no central queue for registration clerks!! HUH??? EVERY other hotel on the strip has a queue for check in/out. Thus I got in the wrong line, as did another couple that kept hopping from place to place to try and find the fastest clerk. I finally got checked in after about an hour, and was given my room. I went to my floor and walked down a very long hall that looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in days, and hadn't been maintained in years. The walls showed serious signs of distress and the carpet was filthy. I didn't realize this was to be a precursor of my room. Alas, it was. My room was dirty, the sofa stained, and the carpet just plain gross. The view was probably lovely, but my bed was backed to the window. Another small window in the room was so dirty I could barely see out. I called the front desk to ask for another room, all they said was \"sorry, we're sold out\". Not, we'll send someone up to look at things, not we're sorry, let's move you tomorrow... \" So I ordered room service and got a good cup of onion soup, and cold pasta. I was too tired to complain so I retired to my bed. The bed was as awful as the rest of the room. I sat on the edge and immediiately fell off. I had to climb up the lumps to the middle so I could stay in the bed. It was so lumpy I had to curl myself aournd it. I should also note that it took 3 days before I saw a washcloth. I originally thought they didn't provide them, so I used a hand towel in the shower... I had to put up with the room for 5 mights. I did not use any of the facilities since I refuse to spend $30/day for a gym, and I was in training during the hours the pools were open. The restaurants I ate at were good, but expensive. However, 3 of our instructors ate at Stripsteak one night and they all came down with food poisoning. Warning! If you're going to Mandalay Bay for a conference be prepared to walk! It's a long walk from the hotel to the conference center. The place is HUGE!! And the service at the conference center is as lousy as the hotel. There was another meeting taking place near our classes. The people from the other meeting came into our hallway and took our food and drinks. When we complained, Mandalay Bay said \"we could hire security to watch the hall\" Can you believe that!!??? On checkout I received an invitation to complete a survey. I filled it out, blasting the cleanliness and service. The survey asked if I wanted to be contacted, and I said yes, but only if the person contacting me actually cared to help. Guess what... I haven't been contacted! Thank you for reading this very long review... But the long and short of it is that the management and staff of Mandalay Bay just do not care!! I'm trying to get my room changed for the conference I have to attend in October. I really don't want to stay at Mandalay Bay again."

    "content": "My wife and I chose the Mandalay Bay after finding a great package deal, and have always wanted to stay there for the pool experience. We enjoyed our stay, but were not as impressed with the pool area as we hoped. My wife got down there early and had no problems getting two lounge chairs together. The pool area gets very busy about 11 a.m., lots of kids in the lazy river and wave pool. We would suggest getting chairs near one of the outer pools, away from the lazy river and/or wave pool. Less kids! I was disappointed with the wave pool. One wave would come about every 3-4 minutes. Not wave after wave like I have experienced at other pools. Waves not very big, either. Cool break near the beach which allows for easier body surfing, but still too crowded and not enough waves to enjoy for long time. The entire place is very crowded, but great for people watching. There is an adults only area called Moorea Beach, guys pay more than girls to get in. Not many topless, but is an option for you ladies. You can bring your own snacks/water/drinks, plastic only, into the pool area. Sign says no outside food or drink, but we think that means no food or drink from off the property. Can't bring in your own booze, no glass bottles. They sell water in the pool complex for same price as shops in casino area. The tram from MB to teh Excalibur is nice, but walking from MB, thru the Luxor, then to the Excalibur is a nice way to see the resorts and shops. We were in Vegas for 4 nites, and walked back and forth 4 times, and took the tram back and forth 4 times. Nice shops along the way. But being that far south on the strip is not very practical. Now that gets to the other issue we had. MB is a bit far from all the action in the center of the strip. Next trip, we will stay somewhere closer to the center, like Caesars, Flamingo or Paris. We did enjoy the casino at the MB. Nice dealers for the most part, attractive waitresses. High ceilings, a lot of open floor space made for a comfortable atmosphere for gambling. Dealers are helpful if you need \"guidance\". Overall we had a great week in Vegas staying at Mandalay Bay, but it was not because of the resort. We would have had more time to do more stuff if we stayed near the center. We won't stay at MB again, unless we get a great deal. Money talks!!"

The hotel used to rent inner-tubes for $9 a day, which was pretty pricey. Now they only sell the tubes, for $18-25 depending on the size. Too much, especially if every person in your family wants their own. But they do allow you to take in your own tubes, so I would suggest you stop by the drug store before your trip and pick up a few cheap tubes. They'll fill them there, even if they aren't the hotel's. Wish I had known that before going!"

Here's what we experienced: 1) Our room on the 22nd floor had an amazing view of the strip and airport. Some of the furnishings are showing signs of wear, but overall it was a very nice and spacious room. The bathroom is well-appointed and the shower is decent. The bed was very soft and lumpy and definitely needs replacing. 2) Advice was free but EVERYTHING else was extra: $15/day for wi-fi or internet; $23 to purchase inner-tubes for the lazy river; $30 a day to use the fitness centre... you get the picture! 3) This is a VERY family used hotel possibly due to the pools. If you weren't at the pool area by 9:30 a.m. then it became very difficult to find two loungers together. If you are planning to relax and float in the \"Lazy River\" do it before 9:00 a.m. because after that it becomes the \"Crazy River\" full of moms, dads and tots. The wave pool did not live up to it's name and was also very crowded by 10:00 a.m. 4) We ate at the House of Blues. It was a good meal but costly. We checked the menus at the other on-site restaurants and were scared away by the prices and dress codes. We opted for Cheesecake Factory at the Forum Shops, PF Changs at Planet Hollywood and Johnny Rockets at the Fashion Mall. Lunch/dinner for two (2 entrees, 2 soft drinks=$40-$50) 5) The tram is great as it's free and gets you closer to the action. But, it's still quite a distance to walk to the centre strip. Your feet will thank you if you buy the Duece travel pass. This double-decker bus is the cheapest way to travel the strip. You can buy your pass from the driver ($3 one way; $7 all day; $15 for 3 days). It stops in front of the main hotels/shopping areas. (The cost of a one-way cab ride from Forum Shops to Mandalay bay was $11!) 6) If you plan on spending some time in your room relaxing and watching the tube, don't expect great channel selection. This is quite obviously NOT what the hotel wants you doing! movie channels were an extra fee and the HD plasma/LCD TV did not give you access to any HD channels. Bottom line: If you want an adult experience, stay at the Wynn. If you want a family experience, stay at Mandalay Bay, but bring lots of cash, you'll need it for all the extras!"

Our room was OK, but my friends room had the mini bar positioned in front of the TV, so it was directly in your field of vision when you were watching it. Even though we never incurred any charges from it, we felt like we were being set-up. It was a cheap touch to an otherwise well-appointed room and very pleasant stay.

She closed the door. When I called the front desk to ask what it was about. They just said sorry, and that the maid was making sure the room was cleaned. The manager then asked me, What I think she should do about it?. I spoke to three different managers that day. All had a different excuse on why the maid walked in. Basically nothing was done about it other than a quick apology. I was also told to put a do not disturb sign up if I didn't want the maid to come in. I was not impressed how any of the managers treated me, and I will never stay the Mandalay Bay, The Hotel, or Four Seasons again. We checked out after that since nothing was being done.

    "content": "From the outside the Mandalay bay is a brilliant gold structure shining in the Nevada sun on the inside it is a spacious, tropical smelling lovely specimen of a resort that one doesn't have to leave once they enter. Featuring a floral paradise theme in many of the rooms, this hotel is one of my favorite places to stay. If you do go and you can get a room on the House of Blues floor I recommend that for the rooms are very cool and much more subdued type of chamber. Each room has a large bathroom with a big tub and a separate shower which can be good for multiple bathings at a time. The rooms come complete with all the regular Las Vegas Strip amenities (no mini bar). The Casino is pretty and has many places to get a drink up when you're taking a break from black jack hands. The Hotel has plenty of places to choose from when it comes to eating and drinking; my favorites include Red Square for cocktails, House of Blues for comfort food and Fleur De Lyse for fine dining. The pool area can get quite crowded and finding space can be a challenge but it is a nice place to spend an afternoon. The pool was waves and seems to be in the midst of Asian ruins. TheHotel is attached to this resort but I suppose that is a different entity unto it's self."

    "content": "Yes - WOW, we stayed at THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay and we couldnt have asked for anything better! The room was a suite with the biggest bath I've ever been in, I did actually manage to float in the bath it was that deep! The bed was huge and really comfortable, its the only trip where I've not been looking forward to getting home to my own bed! The Mandalay Resort is a great place to be based as its not a noisy as it could be further down the strip, plus its only a few minutes from the airport. The pool area was spotless, with plenty of available loungers, we had 4 in our party and always found beds together. We did not feel it was over-run with kids certainly the lazy river was busy but we werent there for the lazy river. The casino was great obviously better when you're winning, the staff were chatty and you only had to wait a few minutes for the waitresses to come round for your drinks order. The food in the resort was pricey and was not the best. We loved America in the New York, New York, the Mac Cheese is amazing! The portions were also huge so we only ordered 2 main courses and 2 starters for 4 of us. We saw Love The Beatles Cirque du Soliel at the Mirage, it was a good show but a bit far fetched by trying to put acrobat and stories behind some of the earlier Beatles songs. The music was fab though and the Strawberry Daquairies from the foyer helped the evening along :) This was our first time in Vegas so we wanted to cram in as much as possible in our week's trip and I must say we gave it a good bash! I cant wait to go back to Vegas and it'll definately be back to THE Hotel."

    "content": "Me and my wife spent 4 nights / 5 days in this fantastic hotel thanks to an all expense paid trip from my workplace- and it was a wonderful experience. Of course we were there on a fight weekend- Paquiao vs. Hatton and to our surprise the Mandalay Hotel is the official resort hotel for Manny Paquiao so there was quite a contagious buzz in the air that week. Since it was our first time there the FD agent asked if we would like a view of the strip or the beach, we chose beach because..we'll who wouldn't choose a beach view- little did we know that this meant pool area and Airport landing strip complete with an hourly motel and McDonalds view- so, if you are presented the choice- maybe pick the strip. The room was very clean and well kept, we each had our own closet and sink which was very nice so me and the wife could compare organizational and closet management skills all weekend. The individual sinks however finally pointed the finger of blame on me in regards to puddles around the sink back home- at least I won the closet contest. Aside from the ample living space, closet and main bathroom space, the toilet however was stuck in what appears to me as a laundry closet- quite crammed and small...I guess you could say it was kinda (-----). One thing I was surprised by was the lack of turn down service or towel changes- we really only received housekeeping once or twice in our room- maybe I scared them off with the puddles by my sink. The lobby and layout of the hotel is fine and you could spend a day walking around the place if you really wanted. The fitness facility is clean, bright and has ample equipment for cardio and kinda limited for weights- and yes to get there walk right through the spa.. I know the entrance and directions on their map don't mention this - but trust me- blast right through the spa and at the end of it you'll reach the hallway that leads you to the gym. Food choices are vast and go anywhere from cheap to outrageous- the only places we ate at in this hotel was the Noodle Shop (nothing stood out- not good or bad) and the Bayside Buffet which has a Fantastic breakfast buffet. Shops are kinda limited and useless really- hit the strip instead and the Casino... Don't waste your money, if you play the slots they seem to be especially ruthless here and after a few g's we gave up- in the whole time we were there we witnessed no jackpot winners and it explains the lack of players in this place, sling your money in Freemont- avoid the strip- your only fighting chance is where the locals go.. Head to Freemont! Finally, the Beach- wow, waves, sand and beautiful people under the sweltering Nevada sun- fantastic place. The river pool lets you follow the stream around and around-and the huge wave pool (keep in mind to go past the yellow line- those lifeguards will insist\u2026trust me on this) is just awesome. Spend a day out there, definitely worth it! In regards to the price, she is not cheap. In response to all the complaints in regards to the distance from the strip- it ain't that bad- if you cut through the casino and head up the escalator you can take the Free Tram that takes you all the way to the walkway by the MGM and bam- your on the strip- walking won't kill you...it's all the margarita's and condo reps going up and down the strip- that's the killer! The hotel meals, poolside lunches, beverages and room rates are in the higher range of pricing so do this as a splurge, is it worth the price\u2026.after settling years of closet and sink controversies at home- definitely!"

We did rent a cabana, and it was totally worth every penny! The room was nice and beds very comfortable. Hotel wise everyone was very nice and accommodating, the only hotel complaint would be the walls were fairly thin, and you could hear people in the halls talking and doors shutting like they were in your room.

We were traveling with our kids, so we thought it would be a nice change from the average Las Vegas pool. First of all for a mere $430 a night we got a roomy 3 bedroom suite. Which was 360 paces from the elevator. The chairs were ripped, the refrigerator was stocked full of computerized and overpriced goodies. No coffee pot, no dishes, just big rooms with dirty windows, stained throw pillows and 5 TV's. So I thought maybe I was being too critical. So we go down to the pool, which they say is a 2 minute walk, it took us 15 minutes. We get in after standing in line for a baggage check. Get to the beach, the sand starts instantly burning my feet. So we find some chairs, no shade or umbrellas in sight. Get in the pool and they start yelling at me. Your child is too short for the wave pool. So fine, we walk to the other shallow area. It is very HOT this day. So I order a drink. 30 minutes to get an ice tea from the bar. I am in the pool with my daughter holding my drink in the shade, I get yelled at by a lifeguard and he says \"you can't have drinks on this side of the pool.\" I get out and I decide I want another drink, I walk into the bikini bar to get a drink myself, they yell \"no kids allowed in the bar\". So needless to say, I was miserable. It was overpriced, understaffed and their pools were no big deal, too many rules."

If you are not an early riser (8 AM), plan on tipping the staff $5-$10 to find a chair for you. You may get lucky though as it seems there is a morning and afternoon shift. Bring your ID to the pool/beach if you would like a drink. Drinks are generally $10 each. A waitress will usually come around to you but on the Fourth we did not get any waitress service. The walkways are scorching hot to walk on. But then again, the heat is why we went to Vegas! :) Plan on 10 mins for the elevators each way just in case during peak times. If you need a taxi, know that Mandalay Bay is at the end of the strip. Ask the driver to avoid the strip and take the highway. Otherwise you will be stuck at a very, very long light in order to turn around. Quality of rooms did not suffer. You could go to the room for rest and relaxation and not be bothered by the party going on in the hotel. Bed is very comfy though you can tell the pillow top is a bit rounded due to people sleeping on either side and not in the middle. Do wish they had robes and turn down services. The lighting in the bathroom is poor but works with the lighting in most venues in Vegas (FYI for make-up purposes). Overall, upscale feel at the hotel pervades and we will be back. I was also impressed that Mandalay Bay sorts the trash for recyclables."

There were a total of 5 flat screen TVs in our rooms including the bathrooms, and the entire exterior wall was all glass with the most spectacular view. There was a large living room, wet bar, and dining area. The food was good but pricey. One night we brought in pizza from Metro Pizza (rated #1 in Vegas) and ate in the room with all the lights off looking at the view. That was our best dinner yet. I mainly played craps and slots. I noticed that the waitresses were constantly available asking if we wanted drinks. I find this to be rare at other casinos. The crap table crew was fun and lively. They had great personalities and they kept even a losing table, fun. We came with our two daughters and had a great time at the pool (although chairs ARE hard to get together). They enjoyed the Shark Reef Aquarium too. Everything was perfect except at check-out. We were promised from the supervisor at the Players Club that everything would be \"comped\" except for our rooms due to our casino play. He said to check out in the morning in person and our bill would reflect that. It did not. I was told to call VIP services later to straighten it out which I did. I thought all was taken care of and called back later to confirm and nothing had been changed on the bill again. This was supposed to be taken care of, again, and I haven't tried back yet to confirm that. Overall, though, we LOVED Mandalay Bay!"

The restaurants are still good, the shops are OK, etc . . The one thing I did not enjoy was how family friendly Mandalay Bay has become. The pool was full of families, every time you tried to get on the elevator you could barely fit because families of five had huge rafts to bring to the pool. The night scene at Mandalay was sad. Mainly couples too excited to have a night away from the kids dancing to the band playing bad cover songs from the early 90's. The fitness center and spa were great! If you are a family looking for a nice play to stay you'll love Mandalay. If you are single or have no kids there are many other places in Vegas to stay that would better suit you."

We only waited a couple minutes in line to check in, but our turn at the desk went so smoothly that I thought I missed something. We were quickly on our way to wait in line for the elevator to get to our room! It turned out to be the only time that this happened going up, though the button on our floor malfunctioned later that evening and the elevators going down didn't stop. Otherwise our elevator experiences were smooth. Our room was clean, the bed and pillows comfortable but the TV remotes didn't work (hey, we have to check the weather to see if the next day is going to be 106 deg. and sunny or 107 deg. and sunny). The sectional couch looked nice, but could have been more comfortable, especially when you get online for a while (at $15 for 24 hours). We liked the bathroom area since we weren't in each others way when getting ready to go. The pools was what we expectated. We spend our day relaxing, reading, soaking in the cool water so we appreciate some shade, which was had a large demand and short supply. It was quite crowded both days, so they could have had another waitress or two on shift (they disappear for extended periods), but I managed to navigate to the bar for a bucket o' beer when desired. We floated around the lazy river a couple times and I taught my wife how to properly utilize the wave pool like the other (forty) eight year olds. The poor water quality at the MGM gave me pinkeye the last couple years, so I was glad that it wasn't a problem here. I would have liked a better variety of lunch choices, but we made do with what the menu. We caught a game at the sports book, where the waitress seemed to go out of her way to ignore our needs, but the pastrami sandwich at the deli made up for that. Usually we make a trip to the other casinos, but for the most part, we stayed on property this year and didn't miss much (like trying to get around the CityCenter construction). It didn't bother us that we were on the far end of the strip. Overall, we were pleased with our stay and hope to be back next year."

They were very unorganized asking us 5 mins before the start about our order of groomsmen. We were very detailed with what we wanted. It seemed like our \"wedding planner\" if you can call these ladies that was upset that we didn't tip her upfront- so we didn't see her the day of the wedding. The planet I'm from you tip after the service is provided- but since the service was terrible we decided that the $1800 dollars we did spend for the ceremony would be plenty. No attention to detail whatsoever or maybe they just didn't spend the time and just treated us as another one of their 10 ceremonies that day. We weren't asking for red carpet treatment- its Vegas- we just wanted a little more professionalism from these so called wedding experts."

And then it became dirty rooms, being shorted towels in the bathroom and dirty showers in the rooms, to no maid service until 5pm. The toilet in our room also had a dark burn on the seat and the bed was terribly uncomfortable. This hotel always had such a beautiful smell to it, but last time, it was more like a cheap gas station restroom smell. The lazy river was SO crowded, we didn't even get in it this time. When I mentioned some of the problems to the hotel staff, they actually became abusive with me!!!!!! I believe this was once a solid 4-star hotel. However, for the experienced traveler, it's a 3-star, on a good day. What did it for us was the obvious \"escorts\" in the casino and the blatant ones in the hallways, knocking on their \"customer's\" doors. We will NEVER stay here again. Consider yourselves warned."

The room was always clean by at least 10 am. Room service is good. The pool is one of the reasons we go. Our kids are 2 and 4 and love the lazy river and the side of the wave pool not to mention playing in the sand. We usually rent a cabana because it is too hot to stay outside all day with the kids. Cabanas have a mini fridge, tv, fan, chairs, lounge chairs and some even have a change area. They are a a bit pricey but well worth it for us. Food and drink prices are comparable to other hotels. We have been to the spa on previous visits and were very happy with both the Mandalay and The Hotel spas. Kids always love the Shark Reef. NY NY has a great arcade for them too. I have rated the location a 4 only because it is at the end of the strip which may not be great for some people. For us it is one of the pluses for this hotel. It is much quieter than some of the hotels mid strip. It is very easy to catch the tram or a taxi to get where you want to go. We love the scent in the air and the lack of smoke in the casino. We are already planning our next trip back."

    "content": "My friends and I stayed at MB for three nights (Sun-Wednesday). It has a great physical presence and is generally well maintained. Even given the cheap rate of $70/night, I got a good room on a high floor with a nice view of the strip and the airport. I think MB is a good place to stay, but I will detail the problems I had as it appears numerous others have already covered its good points. 1) if you are coming for the pool or pool area, reconsider. All the chairs are taken minutes after they open. You can sit/lay around and wait for someone to leave but that is not my dream of a great LV trip. The pools are wall to wall people and intertubes. Lots of families having fun, which is great, but both the wave and lazy river pools where just too crowded for me to enjoy. 2) restaurants are good, but Raffles and many of the others are really overpriced for what you get (but I guess I wouldn't lower Raffles' prices if I owned the place, it was always busy). 3) a taxi driver tried to rip off my friend on a 3am trip from Venetian to MB and their taxi dispatcher/loader, the front line MB employee for such situations, was totally unhelpful or supportive. My friend said to take the strip and the driver took the freeway and overshot MB for good measure. When they arrived at MB my friend got the doorman/taxi dispatcher and said he was only going to pay the $14 of the $18 meter and explained why. MB's dispatcher said something to the effect: \"why don't you just pay the guy, you don't want to escalate this do you?\" So much for MB taking care of their guests. My friend then asked for security. After about 20 minutes and a call for the taxi commission to send someone over, my friend settled for $12 total and a wave of foreign obscenities barraged at him. The security guy told my friend he was happy to see someone finally stand up to those taxi driver criminals. I understand the taxi dispatcher's incentive: he gets a cut of taxis' strip club \"commissions\" and other \"third party payments\" and so wants to stay on good terms with taxi drivers -- doesn't want to get a bad rep. in taxi land. But it is indefensible of MB to tolerate its employees not assisting its customers in clear cut cases of ripoff. The driver didn't dispute picking my friend up at the Venetian, taking the freeway, or even overshooting the MB exit. The dispatcher should have said \"yes, $18 sounds like too high from the Venetian. If the driver won't take your offer of $14, let's call the taxi commission -- but you should know it will take X hours or minutes.\""

    "content": "I accompanied my husband on a business trip to Vegas for 3 nights. This was my first time in Vegas & I was very pleased at where we stayed. Mandalay Bay was chosen due to a conference my husband attended. From the time I landed at the airport, I noticed how hospitable most of the service employees were (from car rental to hotel). Mandalay Bay is classy; not over the top or pretentious yet comfortable and beautiful. I noticed it is a resort that caters to every type of person - from singles to couples to families with children. The first day I arrived I enjoyed the room. It was on the 25th floor & had a nice view of the pools. I greatly enjoyed the bathroom - having a large space with seperate tub & shower is something I look for in a resort. The one strange thing I will mention, quite simply because it's odd but funny to me, is that when you first enter the room, there is a beveled glass window to the left that looks into the bathroom. While sitting in the tub, you can look out the glass at the hotel room door. I was peacefully enjoying my bath, eyes shut, when I heard the door open. I hadn't secured the permanent lock because my husband was due to return to the room. Of course I thought it was him, but it wasn't! To this day I don't know who it was.. I'd like to think it was the maid! The water was running and again my eyes were closed so all I heard was the sound of the door opening - I called out for my husband, turned off the water & of course heard no response. The door had shut as quickly as it had opened. I actually got out of the tub to check - needless to say I was weirded out! But hey, they deserved to see whatever it is that they saw is my thought. We ate at China Grill that first evening. It was of course pricey but on par for eating in a Vegas resort. I had a tasting option which allowed for samples from all courses. The food was awesome - eclectic Asian. It was worth the price but let me mention that there was A LOT of food. Two people could very easily split that meal. I had a mixed drink that was called Pear Iced Tea - it was very tasty! I enjoyed the beach & pool area - I've read many reviews that said it was difficult to find a lounge chair. I didn't encounter this at all but maybe it had to do with time of year? Anyways, again the service was awesome. Drink girls were prompt & very friendly. The bar & grill on site had a wonderful pita & hummus appetizer that paired well with the turkey avocado on pretzel roll sandwich. Pina coladas were yummy! I had one both on the beach & at a little bar outside the spa area - that one seemed stronger :) I took advantage of some of the Mandalay Spa amenities - please see my review in that section. Also, my husband did decide to eat off site at a local restaurant called Off The Strip - Just Real Food. Please read my review there as well! Overall the Mandalay Bay had everything you'd want in a Vegas resort. I would stay here again."

    "content": "Stayed for spring break with my family. I was worried about my teenage daughters being there during spring break and all the college students. It was no different than any other time of the year. The hotel was very clean and we had a great time during our trip. We did have a problem one night since the people next to our room had a party. It seemed like the walls were paper thin since we could hear the music and talking. It was probably 1:00 A.M. and we were ready to go to sleep. We called security and they were there within five minutes to take care of the problem. Another problem was that there was only one restaurant open late. The service was terrible since it took a long time for them to give me my food. Overall, this hotel is nice and quiet but I will try another one next trip to Vegas. I am always receiving free night offers from other hotels hotels I have stayed at, but this one only sent me discounter rates. I enjoyed it because it was a family trip and I wanted to be away from the \"partying scene\" but wll stay somewhere else next time."

Went to the pool both Sunday and Monday. Sunday we did not find chairs right away so just set up along the pool side had a cabana all day (10:00-7:00) Monday. well worth extra money for us. Amazingly it was a very relaxing trip and MB was great, nice staff. elevators - never a problem kids at the pool - more in the beach area but very few in the east or west lagoon pools rooms - a little worn, but who cares, you are in them 6-8 hours a day"

When we were out at the pools, it was like being at a resort on the beach in Hawaii, or the Caribbean or Mexico. Lots of palm trees and flowers. It was hard to leave the hotel and venture off. First day we got to Las Vegas. We arrived at the hotel at 1 pm and were able to check in right away. The hotel is the largest on the strip and very imposing when you first drive up to it. Like how the heck am I going to find my way around here? But it was pretty easy. They had a lot of signs with arrows that helped a lot. Our room was VERY far from the elevator! The room was amazing! Very big and pretty. I love the big tub and HDTV in the bathroom. You wouldn't think you would want a TV. in the bathroom, but it was nice to watch the news in the morning while getting ready. One day I had a bubble bath and watched part of a movie. Only until the water got cold :) The bed had a down mattress topper and was very soft and comfortable. The windows were huge with an amazing view. The only bad thing was the fridge was full of stuff to buy and was electronically controlled to charge you if you took something out of it. So was not usable for us. The first thing we did after getting tour room was to change and go down to the pool area. We luckily found lounge chairs because someone was just leaving. It was packed that day. Hundreds of people. Lots of college kids. After our swim we got showered and changed for dinner. It was our anniversary, so we went to the Rumjungle, in the hotel. They have Brazilian food. Their specialty is the barbecued meats on skewers. We each had the *Brazilian Rodizio-style \"fire-pit,\" signature entrees include Wood-Fire Mai-Tai Cured Island Spiced Salmon and Huli-Huli Rotisserie Chicken with a Pineapple Teriyaki Glaze. Pork, Beef Sirloin, Tri Tip, Lamb etc. They start you off with salads and cheese All very interesting and different from anything we have had before. and very good rolls. Then they bring you a platter with rice and beans. Different guys come around with the meats on tall metal skewers and carve you off some. A few minutes later a another guy with something else. Until you finally say \"no more\" ! It is all you can eat. We could have asked to more of anything we had. Everything was very good and an experience to say the least. We walked all over the hotel afterwards to walk off some of the dinner. Played a few slots etc. Day two we rented a car. We were able to pick it up right at the hotel. They had an office at the hotel. I reserved one before we left home. We started off going to Henderson and having breakfast at the Green Valley Ranch. It was a pretty resort with beautiful grounds. Very good price for a yummy buffet ( this was our only buffet of the trip). We drove to the Lake Mead recreation area. It was warm but not too hot. We went to a beach on the lake and I floated around on the ring for a bit. We took a nice drive through the area, and came out of the park at Lake Las Vegas, where we walked around the shops on the waterfront of the lake. Had a nice walk along the lake. Saw a cute baby wild bunny. Then on to the historic Freemont district to see \"Old Las Vegas\". We spent 4 hours there. It was fun. We played some old fashioned slots that took real quarters. Had a couple 99 cent Margaritas. We had dinner at Mickie Finnz. They had a Monday night special. Rib Steak dinner and a beer for $10.00. The chef was barbecuing the steaks outside in front. They were delicious! Drove down the strip at night and saw all the lights and hundreds of people walking on the strip. We got back to the hotel parked the car and went back to our room. We were tired out! Jim's birthday. We decided to explore the strip a bit. We took the tram that went to the Luxor and walked from there to the MGM. We saw the Lion exhibit and took part in a group survey for a new T.V. episode. It was interesting. We didn't care for the show though. We planned to go to lunch at Ellis Island. We heard it had really good food for reasonable prices. We took a free shuttle to the Hard Rock. Someone told us we could walk to Ellis Island no problem .Well it was WAY TOO FAR! We were very relieved when we finally found it. It was good and cheap. Afterwards we walked to the nearest hotel to get a cab back to our hotel. A limo driver said he would only charge us $10.00 to take us back. So we got back in style in a limo :) We went to the pool and swam a bit when we got back. They have something there called the \"Lazy River\" It was really fun to ride the swim ring on it. It was crowded with other people. Kind of like bumper boats. But beware There is a waterfall around a corner that you can only escape by going way to the right then they way to the left. Or you get soaked! We tried the wave pool. It was kind of boring. For Jim's Birthday dinner Jim wanted to go back to the Rumjungle for happy hour and order drinks and free appetizers. They had good drinks but the appetizers were two small Chimichungas. So we walked around trying to decide which of the many restaurants in the hotel Jim wanted to go to. We walked by one of the nightclubs at the hotel and a really good band was playing. Very good female lead singer. It was a promotional party for Rockstar energy drinks. We went in to listen to the music and a gal brought us two drinks. Rockstar with vodka, for free! We ended up staying there for over an hour. Free drinks and great band . We danced too! It was packed with people and very fun. We got too drunk and decided to find some place for dinner. We ate at the House of Blues. I had a barbecue sandwich and Jim had a Margarita pizza and half my sandwich. Afterwards we played some slots and back to the room to bed. Next day home. Tired and slightly hung over. :) We loved the hotel. Would definitely stay there again. Anytime.

    "content": "My wife and I were planning on spending a long weekend in Vegas with her family, who were flying in from the west coast, and we all wanted to stay at a casino with excellent outdoor facilities for sunbathing as well as quality lodging, dining opportunities and gambling. Our online research leaned towards Mandalay Bay (MB) and so we decided to give the casino/resort a try. Our four day/three night vacation at MB began early Friday afternoon with a quick and pleasant check-in experience. Our first impressions were very positive as everything appeared luxurious and visually appealing. Our room had a cozy king size bed, big screen television and luxurious marble/tile bath. The closet space was more than adequate and a nice touch included a safe inside to secure valuables. Concerned that some casino hotel rooms recycle smoky air through the vents, we need not have worried as our 14th floor room at MB circulated nothing but clean air over our entire stay. Our only other concern was the chance of picking up other folks' conversations due to \"thin walls.\" Although some young folks were a bit inconsiderate in loudly conversing on one of our nights (hopefully they were celebrating a big win in the casinos!), we really didn't have any problems with noise from adjacent rooms which was a plus. The main reason we stayed at MB was to take in their famous pools and poolside setting. To say it was a treat would be quite an understatement! We were surrounded predominantly by a 20 and 30-something crowd; however, they were having a great time and everyone was, for the most part, considerate. For example, one day we were late in getting to the pool are which meant no lounge chairs were available. So, as we made do with throwing towels down on the beach, folks near us were nice enough to let us know when they were leaving so we could use their lounge chairs. The facilities themselves were very clean and well organized ... though the sidewalks to get from one area to another were a bit narrow but not a big deal at all. The temps were in the mid 80s during our stay and the wave pool was around 80 degrees or so which was a perfect refresher after getting toasty from the warm, dry sun. We didn't use any of the other pools but did hop in the lazy river which was fun. We also used the spa but it was only lukewarm and not too enjoyable. Servers passed by regularly to take drink orders and had no problem letting us charge them to our room which was very convenient. We didn't try out the Moorea Beach Club but it looked very elegant and perhaps we'll give it a go the next time we stay here (spoiler alert on our recommendation for this hotel!). In all, the pool area lived up to its hype as one of the best in Vegas - if not, THE best. We dined at MB for all meals during our stay and were most impressed by the quality (and quantity) of our meals everywhere we ate. The Noodle Shop (reminded me of the type of food served at PF Changs but better) was wonderful on our first night. Breakfast the next morning at Raffles Cafe was not only delicious but kept us full the entire day! Dinner that night at rumjungle was an absolute dream! They filled us up so much that we scaled down to a small breakfast, the next morning, at Red, White and Blue which was still filling! Our final night was spent at Jpop Sushi Bar & Lounge and the sushi was, by far, the best we've eaten in over a decade! Lucky for my wife and I that we're runners, as we both gained a few pounds on this vacation, which means we had a few extra miles to run when we returned home to burn it all off! Dining at MB was first class all the way and there's something available for every taste to ensure nobody is left disappointed. Finally, we visited the Shark Reef Aquarium and were very impressed. Admission buys you a tour of the aquarium with an audio guide that provides helpful and informative information on the exhibit. I loved it all but was most impressed by the sharks who, when they pay you up-close face time, can be somewhat intimidating; I sure wouldn't want to have a run-in with them! In summary, MB is an outstanding casino resort at the very end of the Vegas strip. We both had a wonderful time and will definitely visit again. The only advice I'll offer, and it's something that's been said over and over, is get to the pool as soon as it opens in order to guarantee yourself a lounge chair! MB gave us plenty of \"fun in the sun\" and we'll be sure to come back for more in the future!"

I live in Orange County and stay in Vegas at least half as dozen times a year. My traveling companion girlfriend is a travel agent. I was in room 25215 over the holiday weekend. I gave a Voluntary statement to Brian Keough in security still don\u2019t have a references number though. Myself , my 14 year old son and my girlfriend of many years were invaded by hookers Sunday Morning. I sent my son to Starbucks for morning coffee at about 8 AM. When I opened the door for his return 2 women barged into the room. Scantilly dressed stoned, yelling we have weed. I was sort of in shock trying to figure the scene. One of the girls went to the bed hicked up her skirt and began to dry hump away and moan as my 14 year old boy and girlfriend watched. We all started yelling at them to leave. They told me how I liked it and grabbed at my privates several times. They finally left. I called security immediately and gave a verbal report. I expected to see at least someone come up for a more elaborate report and a person or 2 in security uniforms looking around. None of which happened. At 2:30 in the afternoon after thinking about we went to security desk to fill out a written report. Brian Keough pleasant enough gave us forms we filled out and I\u2019ve enclosed. He told us to come back and get a DR# and find out who had been assigned. We went back 4 hours later talked to Eric Simmons about the report, he couldn\u2019t find it and said to come back later. We did he gave us a copy of what we had filled out but still no references number. He suggested we come back again to find out the number and that we talk to guest services. Called back still no DR# . After leaving security we walked over to the front desk and spoke with the manger on shift Sunday evening a tall bigger dude with dark hair. He told us that he needed a DR# and didn\u2019t have any authority to compensate. He suggested we call/ come back when we had the report number. I called Tuseday from my office and got the absolute runaround. I will not stay at your property again thats 2 times a year for 20 years and my girlfriend travel agent will not refer people there in the future. It\u2019s a damn shame because you do have a nice property. You have to show a room key to get into the pool but, nothing to get up to the rooms. Nice security...."

The wave pool and lazy river were awesome. The only thing that could be improved upon for families with young children is to have more casual dining choices on site like the Venetian has. The service was excellent. Our luggage and rollaway bed were delivered to our room in the short time it took us to ride up on the elevator."

The house of blues, became an unsuspected favorite during happy hour, with wonderful bartenders and unbeatable special! i have been bragging about this place since i got home, and am already looking up when i can go back...You CAN NOT go wrong with mandalay bay, and absolute must stay..HANDS DOWN!"

My brother and his wife were on the other side, and it was much quieter, and a nicer view. Make sure you ask for a strip view room. There is a strange mix here. \"The Lion King\" was playing and the wave pools are great for those with children. Because of that the place was packed with kids. On the other hand, \"The Bay\" tries to cater to the jet set, and you see young partiers and pretty girls in thong bikinis mixing it up with all the kids. I was into neither crowd, so to be fair I was really out of place. The pools were packed, no lounge chairs after about 10am, and the elevators were worse. We waited for about 20 minutes for an elevator mid-day. The place was fairly clean, but not as clean as the Bellagio or Wynn or other places I have stayed. Worst of all these places are like cruise ships. They capture you with the low room rates and then hold your bank account hostage for water, drinks and food. $4 for a small bottled water, $10 for aspirin, $12 for a Martini, really expensive meals, etc... Remember, you are at the end of strip here making almost all visits to other locations cab or tram necessary, except for the two casinos next door. First time here and I would not really recommend it for a great Vegas experience."

Mandalay Bay is a first-class facility with their renovated pool area and rooms. I have stayed at this property on two other occasions and usually have found the gambling to be poor compared to other hotels on the strip; yet, we enjoyed loose slots and a very fun craps experience. Some may complain about the hotel's location but we have no problem walking through the adjoining Luxor and Excalbur or simply taking the monorail to the Excalibur-Ny Ny area. I recommend building in time to enjoy the pool at Mandalay Bay. We actually arrived both early AM (9 ish) and mid-day (2 PM) and found ample seating. The pool seemed to really clear out by 4:30 PM. Our only problem did occur at the pool where we bothered by two pesky pigeons which really added to the beach experience. Hopefully, Mandalay Bay will take steps to remove these birds from the pool area. They were constantly trying to get at guests food and belongings. Birds aside, the lazy river and wave pool are very fun. Another must-do is the Burger Bar at Mandalay Place. Two final personal recommendations to make would be the Monte Carlo Breakfast buffet (I know all hotels have a buffet) but the Monte Carlo is very fresh, clean and reasonable ($11 per person). Lastly, a good, quick breakfast is to take a quick walk through Luxor and hit the Krispy Kreme Donut restaurant at the Excalibur food court. Makes for a cheap and fast breakfast! We were in standard king room. The bed and furniture are very modern and above average. Everything was very clean and their bathrooms w/separate showers are very impressive. Will defintely return!"

The pools were great but very crowded and bring your own tubes to go on the lazy river or they will charge you 23.99 for a tube... there is no \"renting\" them as the site says there is. but were still a lot of fun. Now about the food... I went here six months ago and the buffet was the best in las vegas but after this weekend I would almost say it was the worst. the selection is the same at noon as it is at 6pm. the quality seemed to have gone down quite a bit. the noodle place was awesome the teens said. all in all a great family trip, and I have never had a better night sleep in a hotel in my life. and if you are going to go to the aquarium go there before you go to the buffet... they have a special price to add dinner and it save like 10 bucks per person. we also saved a ton of money by bringing a ice chest and suitcase filled with snack food and drinks. sodas from the mini bar cost 4 bucks and the display on the counter is weight and item sensitive so when my teen first walked in and saw that they put out cookies for us she didn't get that that little pack of tiny cookies was $8.62. also make sure if you are going to gamble at all to get a player card, they comped 2 breakfast bufftets for me after only like 4 hours of play."

I agree the room's are very nicely done and very clean. We went to the west pool as it was quite, the other pool's were packed and all 20 something's in competition with each other, not our scene!

    "content": "My husband and I stayed at the Mandalay Bay for two nights in early June. The purpose of our trip was business, but we'd hoped to have some fun while in Vegas. We chose the Mandalay Bay because of a good online deal and reviews. The bathroom looked wonderful in pictures (and to be fair, it was quite nice). The room was relatively large. The bed would have been fine except that the covers were a feather duvet and it's just too hot for that. There were TV's in both the bedroom and bath, but we never turned them on. Check in at 4PM was a madhouse with people forming lines where ever there was a \"Welcom\" sign. Unfortunately, the line we chose had a major problem at the front, so check in took over 45 minutes (even after we changed lines). Also, the man checking us in was very distracted and told us that our \"deal\" included a $50 credit, so charge everything to our room. Too bad that he failed to tell us that it only applied if we spent money at \"The Beach\" which wasn't open during the times we were at the resort (why do they close the pool at 7PM?) We asked if that could be credited to the drinks we bought in the bar and were simply told \"no, next time pay closer attention to your deal\". The casino had a lot of smoke, but it was disguised by a coconut scent. I am not an anti-smoker (actually, I smoke), but it was stronger here than most other places we visited. The ice machine (one per floor) didn't work. $14.99 for each 24 hours of wi-fi? Heck, the Super 8 gives it for free. No shuttles. Don't even think of opening/touching the mini bar. The fridge one is weighted, so if you touch anything, you're warned that you will be charged. (I read all the placards and books in a room). NO IN ROOM COFFEE. Sorry, but my morning coffee is important, and I do NOT want to leave the room to go buy Starbucks (I don't care for that brand or the prices). So, I checked the room service menu. Coffee (1 pot) runs $13 PLUS a convenience charge! Rum (Bacardi or Captain Morgans) delivered to your room runs a whopping $150 per bottle (unspecified size) plus a convenience charge. Hey, I could have rented a limo for 2 hours to go GET rum for less than that! Other spirits were equally overpriced, but I'm a rum drinker. There was some wear and tear in the room and throughout the hotel. I'd suggest that some of the convenience charges might be applied to fresh paint and repair of damaged furniture, not to mention a working ice machine. In all, I don't feel like the place lived up to the hype. Also, it was quite some distance from the rest of the strip, and the shuttle to Excaliber (which means a short walk to cross the street to get anywhere) doesn't operate in the early morning, when we needed to get moving. On our second evening there, we used our monorail passes which we'd bought to attend to our business to go to other properties. We'll try a different hotel next time we have to visit Las Vegas."

Buy your bottle of water at the gift shop for $3.50 as opposed to $8 Figi bottle if you order it while laying out. Buy a $24 floatie for the lazy river...it's worth it. I sold mine to someone waiting in line for $18. We were there for a bachelor party, and were very impressed by the quality of ladies at the pool; however, too many kids running around for my taste."

Overall positive experience, although the Memorial Day swarm ruined the end of the trip. Room was great, and the housekeeping staff did a good job. A couple of requests were delayed, but overall good. Check-in was long, and the staff member we dealt with was a bit low-key. They could use a queuing system, as some people just want to cut-in, wherever they can. Some maintenance items went unrepaired: The up/down indicator light cover on one of the elevators was missing, and was not replaced within the week that we were there. Makes the hotel look beat-up. Rooms are large, and well equipped. Bathrooms are large as well. Negative experiences: 1. Ventilation system was noisy. Asked to be repaired. Some improvement was noted, but still rather noisy the entire stay. 2. Cocktail waitresses in casino didn't come around the slots at all. Could see them once in awhile, but very difficult to get a drink. I tip very well, but didn't get the chance, as I think I only actually received one drink the entire week. Started gambling at other resorts. 3. Pool area: Everyone oohs and ahhs over Mandalay's pool area. I personally don't have time to sit around the pool in a town like Vegas, but my wife and daughter (especially my daughter) like to lay around and tan. My 90 minutes by the pool was no fun due the ridiculous wind during my time there. The ladies had a good time a couple of days, although finding a lounger was always difficult. The last day there, though, the Memorial Day crowd swarmed in, and many of them were acting like red-necks and frat boys. A group rented a cabana, proceeded to trash it. They ran, yelled, cannonballed, chased girls, broke bottles, etc. in and around the pool and generally ruined the environment for all within 100 feet of them. Staff and management were ineffective, and that was the most disappointing aspect. I don't think it should matter that these hooligans were spending more money than the average guest. The hotel has good security staff, and they should have utilized them by removing these disruptive morons from the area. Overall, the hotel is nice. The pool area, which everyone raves about, didn't really matter to me. I think it's more kid oriented, with the wave pool and the lazy river. A lot of people want to lay around and tan in peace. There are better hotels for this."

The check in was prompt although not informative and the lady could of been happy in her work. The room which was allocated to us was on the 33 floor very large,mondern and contempary it was a king room the only grumble i would have was it must of been located in the smoking section and we are non smokers.Elevators were always ready and available. The taxi from the airport cost us 25 usd and on return only 12 usd not sure why these rates are not equal...... There are many nice resturants in the hotel we ate in the House Of Blues& Shangai Lily both we were given a friendly service and the food was nice although the prices all over Vegas are steep so i would say you pay for what you get. There is a Mcdonalds/Subway&Mini shop over the main road if you go through the Travel and tourism lobby exit which are alot cheaper!!! Our favourite resturant which we found in Forum shopping center in Ceasars Palace was the Cheese Cake Factory,Resonable prices ,large selection on the menu,very big portions,brillant cocktails& lovely cheese cakes, We went there three times it is that good...)) The hotel itself is very moden,spacious the pool area is large but not large enough...... if you are not down to the pool/beach for 8.30am/9.00am you would not get a bed for the rest of the day as it is packed.Not some where you would go to for a relax as in all areas you have music blasting out all through the day!!!!! The Mix Bar in the Hotel section is worth an visit the view is excellent. I would stay here again but just feel the hotel is that large you are just a number .....But no worries about returning the issues are small and do not cause any major effect towards your holiday."

However, it would take approximately 1 hour or more to clean the room???? I am not a unreasonable person, but when you make reservations at a hotel way in advance, pay for these rooms in advance then you should expect to be treated with respect and have a room waiting for you! We did not get into our room until 2:00 am.... I have been to Las Vegas several times; this was my first trip to Mandalay Bay. I have always stayed at a different hotel and I will go back to that hotel.

Check in was smooth, and the front desk lady was very helpful. We had inquired about being on the 6th floor to be near some friends, but she told us that she had a much better room available for us on the 23rd floor, so we took that. We appreiciated her honesty and offer of a better room. The casino is very, very nice. We didn't notice the smoke and it was set up perfectly. The poker room and sports book are among the best! we loved playing in both. They do have a lot of single deck and continous shuffle black jack, which isn't our preference, so we took the walkway to Luxor to play there. It has everything else that we really liked though. We ate at the Burger Bar the first night we were there. It was a type of build your own burger, and had a lot of choices. It was a bit pricey for a burger, but it was very good, and on par for that type of restaurant in Vegas. The pool was one of the main reasons why we wanted to stay there. I knew from looking at TA that chairs filled up fast, so I got down there around 8:30 on Saturday morning to grab some chairs for our party. They only give you 2 towels and I saved our chairs that way and using magazines, and other personal effects for the other 2. The rest of the party joined me not long after, and I noticed others trying to save chairs. it was getting really full around 11 and almost impossible to find a chair after that. The lazy river and wave pool were really fun. The waves only came every 3-5 minutes and it was one wave only. The lazy river was a bit small compared to the MGM Grand pool, but nice nonetheless. Overall the pool was nice, but I prefer the landscape and layout of the MGM Grand pool. The rooms were fabulous! We had a high level room that over looked the pool. The safe worked great, and the large TV was nice. The bath had a seperate tub and walk in shower, that were both great to use. The only thing that was questionable was the feather bed on top of the mattress. It didn't seem to fit and between that and the non-fitted sheets, every time we moved, the bed just got more mussed. I didn't care for it, but a minor enough issue. We hit the champange brunch on Sunday before check out and it was a great deal. It was $22.95 for the buffett and champange and or mimosa's. We definatly got our money worth. A great buffett. This was only time we ate the buffett, so not sure how any other meal stacked up. All in all, we will definatly consider staying again. We loved the casino, but the location, and cost might make us choose elsewhere. We got a good deal online for the weekend rates, and that was the driving factor in our decision to stay there. A great place if money is not an issue."

The pool area, which in my opinion is the best in Las Vegas that I've seen, opens around 8:00 and closes at 7:00. The Grill is from 11:00 - 5:00. If you want to relax by the pool, drink margaritas and eat as much as you want - this is the deal for you! Debbie Los Angeles, CA"

    "content": "We spent two nights in Mandalay Bay over the Memorial Day weekend. It was out first visit to Vegas, and while I would prefer a more central location, the resort itself delivered everything it promised. It is very classy hotel with a nice, relaxing atmosphere. Many reviews here mention their signature fragrance that gets rid of the smoke in the casino. I am very particluar about the smells but I could not smell anything in the casino: neither smoke nor fragrance, which is wonderful. The staff was very helpful and responsive, the room - large and comfortable, the view of the strip from our room window - amazing. My only two complains are that: 1)I would like to have more dining options after 11pm. Most of the restaurants seem to be closed at this time which is very unfortunate as we dont get to dinner until very late at night when on vacation. 2) The Tram connoecting Mandalay Bay with the rest of the Strip stops running at 10:30. We discovered it the hard way and had to walk back. Not a very pleasant experiance when exhausted from all the other sightseeing. All in all a very good experiance and would definitely recommend."

Great modern resort, excellent facilities, courteous staff and great stores and restaurants within the property. We had several requests for our stay \u2013 since we have an infant, we requested a stroller to be available at the bell desk and a crib in the room. When we arrived at the hotel, there was some confusion since our cab driver dropped us off at the \u201cThe Hotel\u201d and we had to walk much more than we should have. The crib arrived and was set up within a \u00bd hour of our arrival and although there was some confusion regarding the stroller, it was quickly rectified. In fact, an employee came to find my wife to clear up the misunderstanding. Overall, a great stay. Found employees to be very helpful with directions and suggestions about places to visit. The Tram is useful for the one time that we decided to visit the other hotels down the strip and there are enough stores within the complex to keep your interest. There were some drawbacks that potential visitors should be aware of. \u00b7 The wave pool is overhyped. 2 years ago we were staying elsewhere and visited Mandalay Bay. Seeing it through the window as a visitor resulted us in having this mystique when it fact the wave pool doesn\u2019t deliver. \u00b7 The lazy river is relaxing \u2013 not a major trek but nice for a hot day. Aside from the fact its short, you\u2019re not required to be on a tube. The issue is you have people who either walk/swim the lazy river and it becomes a nuisance when you\u2019re just looking for a relaxing tube ride and you have people passing or splashing you. \u00b7 Heard some comments about how you\u2019re far from the rest of the strip. Depending on how you want to spend your time, this could be a negative. For us, was the opposite since it was our 2nd trip to Vegas and Mandalay Bay has enough on its own to be entertaining."

    "content": "My wife and I just recently went back to Vegas for our Anniversary, we were married there 6 years ago. We booked a trip after looking online and received a great deal to stay at the Mandalay Bay. The price was something we were unable to pass up after reviewing multiple deals for alternate hotels with less ratings. This was our mistake!!! The deals are for the rooms only! Here are some points to consider... 1. Rooms are fantastic. Big flat screen TV, large bathroom with seperate shower tub and his and her sinks. Floor to ceiling windows(careful they make you dizzy the first time you look out of them). However, after all of the good I must tell you that regardless of the room type you book, King or Queen, they can't guarantee the room. They started us in a double queen, then we were able to move the next day. A inconvience that is more of a pain than anything. 2. Casino is large and smoke free. They pump a smell of coconut into the place and you can't smell the smoke. Large poker room and sports book. Slots are tight and drink service non-existant. The only time we were offered a drink, the waitress forgot who ordered what and we had to ask and she said she forgot and she was sorry...this is what they do all day long I thought!?! Didn't hear a single jackpot the entire time we were there. 3. Food is expensive, even for Vegas. Don't get me wrong, in Vegas you'll pay for some food...this isn't the Vegas are parents were used to! However, this place has fantastic restaurants, all which will cost you above $50 dollars each meal, and that's just breakfast and lunch. Dinner is easily above $100. However, I must brag on one restaurant, Border Grill. The freshest mexican cuisine I've ever tasted and the service was the best! I would recommend this to anyone in Vegas...must go!!! 4. Service is non-exsistent. From the casino to the front desk anyone else that you would need, this is where the economy is hitting Vegas...PAYROLL! There is no one there to help you. For as nice as this hotel was, there should be some service. 5. Waterpark is nice and big. 7 different pools to choose from with a wave pool and a lazy river. Chairs come at a first come first serve basis with signs saying no saving, however, believe the other reviews as well, you better get down there early to find a chair as they go fast. Also, lots of kids everywhere. This didn't bother us, however, a point to make as it can get loud and non-relaxing. Overall if a very expensive Vegas experience, with no winnings and subpar service is what you are looking for, this is the Hotel for you. Look into what you are truely looking to get from your visit to Vegas. If it's to have a good time and spread your money around, there are multiple hotels that are looking for business to come their way and it shows through service and value. Don't go for the best deal as they will make up the money they save you and take more from you for less!"

This hotel is beautiful and classy without being over-the-top and ostentatious. We went for the pools and spent most of our time there. (People start lining up before they open at 8am to get good spots). If you wait too late to get down there, it can be a challenge finding an open spot. We lazed underneath gorgeous palm trees and ate fresh fruit. Loved the lazy river. We liked that it was on one end of the strip because it seemed less frantic inside. Also, their signature fragrance is wonderful,and there was no cigarette smell. You absolutely have to see the Lion King, their new show. It deservedly received a standing-ovation from our audience. My only complaint was that the housekeeping never got to our room one day, and we had to call to get it done at 8pm. Another minor annoyance for us was the lack of free-wifi. On the other hand, it forced us to stay off the internet and relax. We loved it so much, we are talking about doing this every year after school ends. It was magical...."

    "content": "We stayed at the Mandalay Bay for two nights (one comped; one at casino rate) in a standard room on the 23rd floor. The rooms are not as spacious as the up-scale hotel/casinos but on par with Paris Paris and New York New York. The bathrooms, on the other hand, are a bit above average with two sinks, a good-sized tub and a separate shower. The stool is in a separate small room/closet. Mandalay Bay, perhaps because of its location at the end of the Strip, seems to have been badly mangled by the economic recession. Evidence of cutting corners was everywhere. We stayed on Thursday and Friday night (weekends would likely be different) and the only Pai Gow table was in the Crystal Room (high roller room even though the limit was only $25) and was manned by the most unpleasant dealers that I have ever played with. Before, I enjoyed playing in a central, separate area that had three or four open tables. Only a handful of tables were open during the time we were there. We enjoyed the food at the buffet and the Raffles restaurant. We order from room service on one occasion, and were told only a limited menu was available as the kitchen's ovens were cleaned once per week and that was the night. The food, basically soup and salad combos arrived in a reasonable time but the servers seemed to have no idea how to arrange the presentation in the room, so one of us ended up sitting on the bed and the other in a chair. Seemed really strange that they seemed so disoriented. We went to a preview presentation of the Lion King at the theater and found it, well, just average. I guess we aren't into actors dressed like animals, even lions, or operating puppets. But, it was a cleverly staged production. I had a manicure/pedicure at the spa in THE Hotel, attached to the Mandalay Bay, and found it to be an enjoyable experience. I have been in both spas and this one is really very nice and a bit better, albeit smaller, than the one in the Mandalay Bay. We did not try the wave pool or the sand beach but those that were seemed to be having a great time. A major shortcoming of the hotel, a design flaw, is that 8 elevators (sounds like a lot but it's not) serve about 17 floors. In many other Vegas hotels, 8 elevators serves 8 to 10 floors. So, there is often a long line to get onto an elevator, and the line got noticeable longer toward the weekend. If you can be a good room rate, it is a good place to stay. Another above $120-150 will likely leave you disappointed."

    "content": "My wife and I recently stayed at the beautiful Mandalay Bay and overall it was a very good deal for just $90 per night. Some friends got their room for under $70! When all is said and done, you can't beat the Mandalay Bay at those prices. The hotel is very clean and classy with its lush tropical theme and the pools there are outstanding. For dining and nightlife, we only had lunch at the Border Grill, a Mexican eatery located within the Hotel. The food was good, but pricey - I had a salad, albeit a steak salad, with abot six ounces of steak while my wife had a chicken caesar salad and we each drank water - the bill $40! Red Square, a soviet themed restaurant and bar, seems a bit out of place in Mandalay Bay but was nonetheless an interesting location for drinks in the evening and the waiter was attentive and knowledgeable - our drinks there were the best prepared during the entire trip. The whole USSR theme though is a bit tacky in my opinion. The actually have a drink called \"Chernobyl\" on the menu! Um, a bit insensitive perhaps? I mean, thousands of people died from the Chernobyl disaster...What's next - Gulag Soup? They already had to decapitate the statue of Lenin that stands in front of the restaurant due to complaints of insensitivity, when will they learn? The Lion King show was a magnificent spectacle and is surely a can't miss. The cast got a well-deserved standing-o on the night we were there. Tix cost the average for a top shelf show in Vegas and are well worth it. My wife enjoyed several treatments at the spa and raved about her attendant - very satisfied with her massage, herbal wrap and manicure. I ran into some problem with the bill however as the cashier miscalculated their May Special \"buy one service and get the second 1/2 off.\" Rather than argue, I quietly summoned the manager and he graciously corrected the error. I love relaxing at the Mandalay Bay pools and lazy river, but you have to time it correctly. At 10am ona Tuesday, we could not find even one open lounge chair - ridiculously over crowded. We went early in the morning and later in the afternoon on other days when it was far more enjoyable with many fewer patrons. Our room was very clean, but the ironing board was broken ( quickly repalced). The walls seemd thin as we heared lots of our neighbors various activities during the trip. In our opinion, the only real downside to the MB is that it is far from everything else on the strip. If you have car, it's not a problem and the last time we stayed we had a rental. This time however, we did not and a one way cab ride to the Mirage will run you $15. Walking is generally out if it's hot. If your plan is to just chill out at MB, then it's really not an issue though. There is a free monorail that will take you to the Luxor and Excalibur. From there, you can either catch the \"Deuce\" - the number two bus that will take you all the way down the strip and downtown for $3 or $7 for unlimited 24 hour use, or you can cross over to the MGM Grand and catch the othe rmonorail that costs $5 one way down the strip or $13 for 24-hour use. No matter hos you chose to get around though, it takes basically 20-45 minutes to get anywhere past the Excalibur going down the strip depending on where you are headed. I would absolutely recommend the Mandalay Bay Hotel to: - People seeking a romantic getaway location - People with a car and at <$100 per night, to just about anyone..."

I was w/ my husband, mom, and dad and we went down to the pool around 11am and walked around for about 30 min before finding even two chairs to sit in! Left after two hours and never went again for the whole stay...didn't want to fight w/ the crowds (and we were there during the week-not a weekend). The only great thing about the hotel was all the comps they gave me (only me, my other family members didn't hardly get anything!) I maybe gambled w/ $40-$60 dollars one day there and they gave me $15 in free Starbucks and two free dinner buffets valued at $54.00. That was great! The dinner buffet had steak and crablegs on it....well worth going! Nice place to try but probably won't stay there again...will most likely stay at Bellagio or Caesars Palace next time."

However, be warned, Mandalay Bay is far from cheap! I got the distinct impression that the hotel felt it could charge over the odds for every possible item simply because of its isolation at the end of the strip. Examples include: - Two soft drinks from the pool bar = $10 (plus tip) - Two alcoholic drinks in a casino bar = $18 (plus tip), - No $10 blackjack tables on offer for us 'social' gamblers (whereas the Bellagio offered many, even on a busy Saturday night) - $3 for a bottle of water (I saw it for sale in the Venetian for $2.50) - Restaurants were comparably more expensive than other 4/5 star hotels further up the strip where they have to compete with one another. In addition, Mandaly Bay has no food court offering more casual dining options. The quality of the room aside, I certainly felt I got better value for money at the MGM Grand and had a more enjoyable experience. In addition, the extra travelling up and down the strip took it out of me a little more than I expected, despite the free monorail to/from the Excalibur (although this closes when you need it most in the early hours) and the Deuce bus."

Everything else about the hotel is fantastic, except I found the buffet to be a little disappointing for the price ($27), like most strip buffets. Check-in was a breeze and very professional. The TV is a little small, but I had another one in my bathroom. I also had a shower and a separate tub. The aquarium is a little disappointing for the price ($35). It's very nice, but you can visit SeaWorld for $65. But if you're looking for something to do, this will fit the bill. The hotel is gorgeous, with one of the best pools in town (wave pool with sand). However, if you go in the winter, they will have only one dinky pool open, and it is a good ways from the hotel, which is maddening, since you pass multiple pools to get to this one. I don't even know why this winter pool even exists, it's so far away from the rest of the resort. There is a tram that takes you closer to the main part of the strip.

    "content": "It takes a little longer to get to the main spots around the strip but the extra walk is worth it! The Mandalay is incredibly clean with great staff and it gets you away from the noise of the strip. Our room was very spacious and in great shape - furniture was all clean, the bathroom had plenty of room and the walk in shower was a nice feature and the beds were comfortable. The pool area was a great place to spend the day - we arrived at noon one day and there were still chairs available. The main wave pool is fun (although you only get one wave every few minutes) and never too crowded. The lazy river is a great way to relax but bring your own tube as the hotel charges $25 to buy one. Drink service is quick and the food at the pool side restaurant is good. Only downsides were that it closes at 6pm and the lifeguards were pretty rude - only doing their job I guess but it got a little annoying when there were multiple whistles going off every 30 seconds. Ruffles cafe had a nice breakfast (pricy of course) and the Noodle House had some great authentic Asian food. Room service was incredibly pricy so we never tried it, I just can't imagine the food would have been good enough to justify the prices and automatic 20% tip that was added. That's one thing that made this resort different from most others - no reasonably priced restaurant options! Head to the Excalibur for a 2 for 1 buffet, the Luxor for a few well priced options or check out Cheap Tickets booths along the strip for some good deals on buffets and sit-downs. The casino is really nice - not nearly as smoky as most other hotels and much cleaner. We're slot players and there were always lots of empty seats. We got out ahead by a few hundred dollars so we were happy! If you want the adventure of the strip without the noise and crowds then stay at the Mandalay!"

We were on the 34th floor and the view was amazing, even if it made us a little dizzy at first with the floor to celing windows! 2 big double beds, extremely comfy, huge HD TV, TV in the big bathroom too! Room was exceptionally clean and is one of the best I've stayed in in my 4 visits to Vegas. Staff were great, our safe jammed and they sent a chap round to fix it in 10 minutes. For any of you visiting the Mandalay Bay go to the Mix Lounge on the top floor of The Hotel at Mandalay (follow the signs) - if you go before 10pm there is no cover charge, you will be knocked out by the views and if you need to go to the toilet (for a sit down) there can be no better toilet on earth - you'll see what i mean if you go !"

I tried the spa and it is a must do if you are here ($20 the whole day if you don't book a treatment). The pool was fun too but that was obviously the most crowded part of the hotel. Rooms are very spacious (we even brought our mountain bikes to our room) with two closets and two sinks and a separate tub/shower. I did not like paying for internet service ($15)...Bring your own drinks and snacks. There is a tram going from here to luxor to excalibur...about $15 to MGM in a cab and $20 bucks to the airport.

    "content": "The exterior, the shopping and the pools are all excellent reasons to visit Mandalay Bay. The customer service? Not so much. We stayed at Mandalay Bay for a DMB concert. Arrived Friday night around 8:30pm and were pleased to see check out would be fast and easy. And it was. Until we went to our room on the 17th floor. Neither my husband nor I could walk too far into the room due to the smell. Overwhelming vomit smell when we opened the door. Ick. Unfortunately, we had to enter the room to use the phone to call for another room assignment. Having paid extra for a strip view, we expected to be moved to that type of room, or better. First off, there was no apology or even surprise from the desk when my husband reporting our room stank of sick so much that we could not stay there. We were offered a room on a lower floor (the 4th) or on the 25th. We took the 25th and reminded them we paid for a strip view. Lugged our suitcases to the second room (there was no offer of bell services at this point) only to find our \"strip view\" had turned into an \"airport view\". And the cell phone did not work. We called (from the 2nd phone) down again and were treated as if we were a problem. Had we not paid extra, this might have been the end, however, we did pay extra and our confirmation indicated strip view. After the \"manager\" checked into another room for us, we were told to go back up to the 17th floor. Again, NO bell services offered to help us schlep back up to vomit floor. Very horrible service to start our trip. The third room were were assigned was fine. The view was nice. The rest of the weekend was fine. I guess I didn't expect a hotel of this caliber to be just \"fine\". The beds were too soft and seemed worn. The furniture was scuffed everywhere and most definitely in need of a rehab, as did the carpet. The bathroom was the cleanest, and, to be honest, the nicest part of the room. The rest of the room also needed a thorough cleaning. There was dust everywhere and the snack bar on the bureau was missing items, which we had to report since we were told if we even MOVED the items, we'd be billed for them. Yes, there are flat screen tvs and the air conditioning was quiet. We also didn't have a problem with neighbor or hallway noise. The pools were spectacular, but all of this is not enough to make up for the lacking we found overall. Next trip, we'll be returning to our faithful Monte Carlo once construction on City is done. The service there has never let us down and we have been able to stay in a strip view Monaco suite for what we paid for a standard strip view at it's sister hotel (they're both part of the MGM dynasty), Mandalay Bay. SOOOOO disappointing. Good thing the concert made up for the crummy room experience. ;-) Oh, and we got the credit card bill yesterday and were charged for a night we already paid for in the deposit when booking, so now, we'll have to deal with that issue as well."

Due to the location at the South end of the Strip it made a taxi necessary any time we wanted to go anywhere else in Las Vegas. $14-99 for internet access was a big surprise after getting free access in San Francisco. I would recommend a a hotel closer to the middle of the strip who have to work a bit harder to attract and keep customers, as we thought this hotel promised to provide good facilities and services but failed to deliver."

    "content": "I stayed here for my nephew's wedding in a Sky View Suite on the 60th floor (restricted access) using the VIP Gold Pass program ($ 200 extra) which included a stretch limo pick up and return at the beginning and end of my trip. I stayed for 6 nights as a single passenger in a 1050 square foot room with a Strip View of Downtown Las Vegas. I have to say while the room was a bit pricey (different price each night) for the 6 nights this was one of the most fantastic rooms I have ever had in any of the hotels I have ever stayed! In had a large living room, a separate wet bar with sink, a separate guest bathroom and closet area, a huge bedroom and a very, very large bathroom! There were 4 plasma t.v.s in the room and each day I got complete bed linen changes and towel services. There was large jacuzzi tub and a shower. The bathroom was fantastic. The view was fabulous. I saw the entire strip from both my bedroom and my living room. Since it was my nephew's wedding, I was able to host before and after parties in my room each night in the living room area, and was able to host up to 20 to 30 people (there wasn't enough furniture for more than 20 but people sat on the floor!) and the housekeeping service gladly bought us more ice and cups free of charge. The room was fantastic for a single traveler. As a Gold Key Traveler I signed up for the $ 200 program, and got a stretch limo to and from the airport and VIP lounge access at the beginning and end of my stay and it was well worth the $ 200 extra. The only caution I would warn you about is NOT to order room service. I thought that one morning I would order a $ 5 bagel and cream cheese and a $ 12 pot of coffee and tip the delivery guy myself but when the bill posted to my room it turned out to be a $ 50 CHARGE for service (which I had already paid to the delivery guy!), plus room service charge, tax, fees, and etc. etc. So it was the most expensive bagel I had ever eaten in my life. Ride the elevator down stairs and go across the street to McDonalds. It will take you ten minutes and you can save $ 50! You'll be back in the room in 10 minutes. The maid service was excellent and I tipped them each day and they even told me I didn't need to do that but they gave me tons of bath soaps and products because i mentioned how much I liked them. There were some problems with the woman next door but I called security and they came IMMEDIATELY and fixed the problem. All in all this is a five star hotel and well worth the money. You'll love it! The SPA is to die for -- separate men and women's get a five day pass-- you'll love the different temp pools and the sauna and steam room. The outdoor wave pools are the best -- the lifeguards are strict. You must be THIS TALL (48\") to enter the wave area -- and the waves and undertow are REAL AND STRONG (I am 5'4\" tall and an adult) and it was STRONG--I got pulled under----so they are SERIOUS about it---its not for little kids---they'll check and measure them and its for a good reason!! But its a unique experience. There are four or five other pools including a lazy river and they have a SAND BEACH -- ask for one of the deck hands to find you chairs and they'll help -- a TIP HELPS."

In fact, Travelers need to be aware that they will be charged for EVERYTHING at this hotel!! LOL Our son took his XBox to hook and and play but there is not jack for this. We have had no problem hooking it up at other hotels we have visited. So much for bringing that along. The pool is a great amenity - IF YOU CAN FIND A PLACE TO SIT!! The hotel is too big to accommodate all of the visitors around the pool. It was a mad house! So many guests were complaining about the lack of seating. If you want to have any snacks or lunch at the pool you will wait in line an hour to get your food. The hubby went IN to the Hotel and walked to the shops to get some sandwiches. That was the smarter idea. The pool cafe or restaurants are tooooooo busy!!! Highball drinks are $10 for a well drink!!! Very expensive! Domestic Beers are $7!!!! Bartenders were friendly but you couldn't get a cocktail waitress. They walked around but never saw them with drinks or never saw them taking orders. They just walk around. I guess you have to flag them down to actually have them wait on you. They have \"snacks\" in your room and a mini bar. We aren't big drinkers so we had no problem with the Mini Bottle stocked Mini bar. I have no idea how expensive the mini bottles were. Back to the snacks = Don't eat these if you don't want to get RIPPED OFF!! My son ate a box of cookies I think it was equivalent to the McDonalds box of cookies and that tiny box of cookies was $9 dollars (NINE)!! Don't be duped into thinking you can use all of those gorgeous pools!!!! You can only use The wave Pool, the Lazy River and one other pool. The other pools are for special guests of another hotel. We got suckered!!! My hubby and I like to work out. We assumed the gym was part of the amenities. NOT SO!! You have to buy a SPA PASS to be able to use the gym. I think it was $40 a day to use the gym with your \"Daily $40 Spa pass\"! How absurd!! The lifeguards constantly yelled at the kids. And they have weird rules in the wave pool. You have to stay between 2 lines. You can't put your chair in the water or sit in the shallow part. The lifeguards will yell at you and tell you to get out. Tubes must be rented or purchased for the lazy river. They don't have them out for just anybody to use. Beds were VERY comfy! Loved the mattresses!! Our room had a gorgeous view of the over crowded pool area. We loved the room! Gorgeous! We ate at a Mexican Restaurant in the hotel. It was very overpriced. The food was pretty good but you didn't get much of it. Our bill was $100 (for 3 people) we each had an APPETIZER AND WATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WATER!!!! Oh yeah!! And they charged us for WATER!! It wasn't even bottled water. They poured it out of a pitcher. LOL!! We were astonished!! We felt like we were constantly being nickeled and dimed at this hotel. Nice place to stay, but amenities are ridiculously overpriced."

MB has over half a dozen award winning restaurants, yet only ONE coffee shop. The hotel has 16 elevators and they all discharge right in front of the only coffee shop. Early morning can be a zoo, and remember all those animals are going through caffeine withdrawal. Nice pool with beach and wave pool, but I have to wonder why in the city that supposedly never sleeps, do they close the pool at 6:00pm ? When you're there for a conference that finishes at 5;00pm there's not much time to enjoy it. Nice workout facility, but with a $30 per day charge for hotel guests. All in all, you'd be better off down on Freemont St, see Old Vegas."

    "content": "We spent three nights at Mandalay Bay and I chose this hotel based on the pool. My husband was attending a conference and we are not big gamblers so the pool was the factor. We\u2019ve had a long cold winter in Seattle and needed some fun in the sun. Check-in went smoothly and our room was perfect for us. 31st floor with a view of the pools. Our king bed was super comfy \u2013 just like at home, two closets \u2013 just like at home, and a great bathroom with soaking tub, separate shower and TV \u2013 wish I had that at home. My husband would have appreciated a coffee maker. Yes, the elevators are inconsistent and the response from the staff was \u201cour elevators have a mind of their own.\u201d The Pools \u2013 there are several pools in the complex including a wave pool and lazy river. People were lining up before the pools opened in the morning and you are hard pressed to find a lounge chair after the first couple of hours. Although there are signs saying you can\u2019t \u2018reserve\u2019 chairs, it is very common to see towels laid out on a chair and nobody in sight for the majority of the day. This is so inconsiderate to those of us who actually want to use pool chairs. Families seem to gather near the wave pool and lazy river and it\u2019s quieter at the outlying pools. We have an awesome wave pool at a water park in Seattle and I was disappointed by the Mandalay Bay wave pool. One wave every three minutes or so. Boring. But the lazy river was fun \u2013 quick current and a good length. Next time I would bring my own inflatable float \u2013 the hotel charges $16 to purchase one and no rentals are available. You can order basic grill items at $10 a pop and drinks are about the same. We found the Border Grill right outside of the pool area to have good food and interesting drinks. I loved the Baha Ceviche. We rented a pool cabana one day and it was really fun to have that extra pampering and extra shade. The temperature went up to 92 degrees and we were able to duck inside and take a break from the sun. The cabana included a comfy couch, fridge including six complimentary soft drinks and six small bottles of water, a bucket of ice, a giant TV which we didn\u2019t use at all, a table with two chairs, and two lounge chairs outside with a small table to set books and drinks on. The cabana also included two floats for the pools. Waiters checked on us throughout the day for food and drink requests which went on a separate tab. My husband was able to finish up some work on his laptop in the cabana while I read outside. It was a great day. Restaurants \u2013 we had one breakfast at the buffet and it was average \u2013 fruit, meats, omelets to order. Nothing especially innovative. We ate twice at Raffles, only because it was the only place open when we were hungry. It was very average and overpriced. There is a Subway sandwich shop across the street and a small grocery store. We picked up a bottle of wine and used the corkscrew and wine glasses provided in our room. Location -- We didn\u2019t mind the end of the strip location. We took the tram to Excaliber, Luxor and walked across the street to NYNY and MGM. We took cabs to evening events at other hotels."

I really hated the pillows though....they were kind of bulky and hard. We ate the buffet breakfast, which had a huge selection of items for the price (15.99 per person) and was pretty good. I only have one small complaint about the service. When checking in, we asked the front desk what time the Shark Reef Aquarium was open and she said 10am to 10pm. So we left the hotel and planned on coming back to do the Shark Reef before going to bed. We arrived back at 7:30 only to find out that it was closed!

My husband talked with a manager to let him know and the manager offerred to give us a free night's stay, but our plane was leaving in the morning. Apparantly, the hours for the Shark reef had changed just a few weeks prior and they now close at 7 or 8 during the week. Overall, this was a nice hotel with a lot to do. Keep in mind there is a lot of walking from the parking garages to the elevators to the guest rooms. I think this is pretty standard in most Vegas hotels because of their size. Oh, and the pool is really nice. There is a HUGE wave pool, lazy river, beach, and regular pools."

    "content": "My wife and I recently stayed at Mandalay for three nights after getting a decent promotion discount on the rooms. A few friends of ours raved how big the pools were at Mandalay and that the hotel was very nice. The good: Check-in/Check-out was very quick and easy. The hotel gaming floor is spacious and spread-out. The Sunday morning buffet was a bit pricy (25-30ish), but it was a special brunch with crab legs and prime rib - both of which were excellent for a buffet. There is also a tram that will take you to the far side of Excaliber, right to the skywalk heading into NY/NY. The tram doesn't make any stops when heading back to Mandalay - which makes it a nice quick trip. The bad: Pool area - lazy river, wave pool, sunbathing. The hotel probably has the largest pool area in Vegas, the wave pool gets up to 7ft deep, and there is real sand all around the wave pool. But compared to the number of rooms (3200+) it makes for a very crowded pool area, and unless you get there at opening (10am) you are lucky to find a seat. It\u2019s hard to blame the hotel for their lounge chair to guest ratio though. It\u2019s definitely the best around \u2013 which is the problem\u2026 most people stay at the hotel just for the pool. The tubes for the lazy river go fast as well \u2013 they were gone by 10:15 on a Monday! The wave-pool is also pretty lame - one medium-sized wave every minute. It would be pretty fun and save for kids, but not much of a thrill for adults. The hotel is also the furthest south \u2013 not ideal if you plan to spend a lot of time on the strip. The Ugly: The hotel\u2019s elevators are so insanely slow. Make sure to hold down the \u201cclose door\u201d button after each stop. The lines around the elevators can also get really crowded which is due to the large number of guests and super slow elevators. The fitness center is part of the spa - you'll pay $30+ for a day pass. Overall: The rooms weren\u2019t as nice as I was expecting. I stayed at Treasure Island last year and thought that their rooms were nicer, their drinks (by the pool) were a lot better and that there were more available lounge chairs at any given time. My wife and I are late 20\u2019s and will probably try out NY/NY or Paris next trip, maybe even TI again. I was a pretty disappointed with Mandalay and I think it\u2019s too hyped up for how crowed it is. I wouldn't recommend it for couples, but it would probably be great for families with kids."

    "content": "Stayed at MBay for a week with two adults and one child (yes, I brought my son to Vegas :). I know reviews on here are mixed, so I'll just add my two cents. What was good: check-in was smooth and easy; the property is beautiful and inside the lobby, casino, public spaces etc. are nicely maintained and clean; staff were consistently friendly; casino was large and not overly crowded; not smokey; dealers were friendly; restaurants were nice; rooms were large; strip view was nice; Shark Reef aquarium. What was great: pools, pools, pools - very family friendly and large - even though it was quite crowded and sometimes hard to come by a seat if you didn't arrive near the opening time; the landscaping; the beds - lovely and comfortable; the huge bathrooms with soaker tubs and tv; housekeeping; the bellmen; the buffet; staff at the pool; the tram to Luxor and Excaliber; the Border Grill; security staff. What wasn't so great: we had some bad luck and were beside some loudly arguing (screaming and slamming, actually) next-door neighbours (not the hotel's fault, obviously) - but the walls are not super-sound-proof; Raffles cafe was slooooowww and too pricey for what you get; sundries are very expensive (but, after all, it is Vegas); a stain on the chair in the room - no biggie; crowded space around the elevators in the lobby area; just little stuff. Overall, I would highly recommend Mandalay Bay. There were all types staying there - singles, couples, conventioneers, lots of families, young, old and everyone in between. The pools are a great draw and if you get there early, you can relax the day away. Be prepared to have the wallet open a lot and try to win some $ back in the casino :) Try the breakfast buffet at the Bay Side; it was really good for the price ($16 for adults, kids 4 and under are free). Kids will love the view of the airport (my boy did) and the planes and helicopters coming in and out, and going for a ride on the tram. You can pop them into the arcade at the Excaliber too. We also liked the shops in Mandalay Place and the dancing penguin outside of the Minus 5 vodka bar there. It was a fun time in a fantastic city. It's Vegas, baby!"

The first impression is the size of the complex. When we eventually found our way from the massive self park garage to registration, we did have a wait of about 20 minutes to check in. Our room on the 26th floor was impressive, with a view over The Strip and the airport. The room was spacious and the bathroom even more so. We liked the TV in the bathroom! The elevator system was good with few delays. The pool area was excellent. The only main problem with this hotel is it's location. At the south end of the main hotels on the strip, it is quite a journey to the central strip, although there is a monorail taking you to The Excalibur. We would recommend The Mandalay Bay as a hotel but would suggest to a friend a more central location would be even better."

I asked to be moved to same room just different location and saw the exact same thing!! The rooms were renovated 2 years ago and looked like they had frat parties in them every night since then. Luckily they upgraded us to the 60th floor and a very nice suite but honestly I would've preferred not to move since we had a great view of the strip. The airport was a little noisy (planes were taking off at 5am!) Sadly we'll be staying at a different hotel next year but will miss the awesome pool."

    "content": "Stayed a couple of nights at the Bay last weekend. Had always wanted to stay there, and got a great rate from the casino side of the house. We used to often stay at Luxor a while back, so being on that end of the Strip was really no issue for us (except as noted below). We liked the casino, restaurants, etc. at MB, so we jumped at a chance to try it. We had a 550DR on the 33 floor. The room was very nice, and very roomy as expected. Liked the his & her closets, but weren't all that thrilled with the bathroom entrance right into the main room. Just a personal, preference, I suppose, but unless you went out of your way to close the bathroom door, it seemed to intrude on the main room. Others have mentioned the slowness of the elevators. We found this to be true much of the time. Of course, it didn't help that half the time there seemed to be families on the car, and the parents allowed their children to get a thrill by playing with the buttons, resulting in unnecessary stops up or down. There did seem like an awful lot of families running around the property. However, we kind of expected it with the popularity of the pools. Parents, and hotel staff, need to do a better job of keeping children out of the casino, however. One thing I haven't seen mentioned much is the issue of jet noise. Our room faced McCarran, and jets didn't stop til well after midnight, and started up again early the next morning. Helicopters were right across the street, also. All could be heard quite clearly and were only muffled when we turned our A/C fan on the high setting. With all that being said, we would stay there again. I thinks it's one of the nicer properties on the strip, despite some minor drawbacks."

A wonderfull bottle of red wine, strawberries to die for and a hand written card fom him. Mandalay is NOT just a hotel. It is a resort and spa. Upscale and not for anyone on a budget. The food is wonderful, the lounge's are great. The staff is always on there toes. The rooms are very clean, well taken care of and very up to date. We have always loved Mandalay Bay. I have stayed at the Wynn, MGM as well as others. I will not stay anywhere else but at Mandalay Bay. Room service is aways on time, with wonderful food and great service.

Our room was on the 28th floor overlooking the strip (It appears you only have a 1/4 chance of this). Although the room was beautiful, it did show signs of use with rug stains and bed covers that looked a little over used. The bathroom as many of the other reviewers have mentioned is the center piece of even the most basic room here. My 10 year old son took a bath every morning just so he could have an opportunity to watch Sponge Bob with the bathroom's HD. I also will say that the casino was well designed and better than most in Las Vegas. It has some decent places to eat and a shark reef exhibit (a bit overpriced). My only major complaint is the pool. Although the pool facility is well designed, on Easter Sunday by 12 noon you couldn't get a chair to save your life. This also applied to the 2 lower pools and the lazy river. I ended up having to go to the South pool and that too had no chairs. I like a few others ended up using the concrete and this was my beach for the day."

We were able to get a non-smoking room upon arrival, but had to get 2 queens, instead of the king we requested. We didn't use the pools this time, but heard it was very crowed with no chairs to be found, so we were glad we hadn't. The only real issue we had was with the elevators. We had to wait up to 5 minutes at times, and there was always a huge backup of people with suitcases trying to get to their floors. There were several elevators, but I don't think all were working. We only had few service requests during our stay- one for a missing \"do not disturb\" sign and the other for extra towels, and both requests were filled immediately. We also requested a later check-out time without a problem or charge. Overall, the hotel staff was very friendly. We ate breakfast at Raffles Cafe and had decent food and service each time. We loved Burger Bar and Shanghai Lily for dinner! There are plenty of restaurants and shops. For cheap liquor/beer/wine, we went across the street to a shop. As far as the casino, our luck wasn't great, and some of the dealers were unfriendly. They also refused to rate anyone betting the minimum at the table (at least at a $10 table), no matter how long you played there. We used the tram to get to the Excalibur Hotel, although it was closed for maintenance a few times, which was very inconvenient. In general, several of the escalators and elevators on that end of the strip were broken, which made it difficult after walking a lot. If you have special needs, it could be very difficult to get around."

I called to complain and they immediately switched our room to a fantastic room on the 25th floor overlooking the strip. That was a big plus. We ate at the Burger Bar in Mandalay Place and it too was great! However, Mandalay Bay seems to be a hotspot for family vacations, with tons of infants to underage teenagers running around. It was somewhat disruptive, hearing babies scream and children complaining. We primarily stayed here because of the beach and lazy river. Don't let them fool you!! You must buy the tubes for the lazy river and they range in cost from $16-25 and are not returnable. The lazy river itself is a tiny circle (no where near as long as any lazy river I've been on) It was actually quite pathetic. The wave pool left much to be desired as well. It was so crowded (again with children) that we ended up having to sit on the sand in the shade because there was no room anywhere and the actually 'waves' was only about one wave every three minutes or so. Again, left MUCH to be desired. Here's our big complaint. While we really enjoyed the food at Mandalay Bay at first (we ate at Mandalay Bay's buffet, House of Blues, Burger Bar, RM Seafood, Rumjungle and Red, White and Blue) my husband contracted a horrid case of food poisoning that was diagnosed by the local hospital after lab results came back as salmonella. The only other spot he could have caught it was at the Wendy's on the strip, but I think its highly unlikely to get food poisoning from fried food. But, I'm not a doctor. All I know is that we primarily ate at the restaurants at Mandalay and when I called to tell them that my husband was hospitalized for three days, all they did was give me $50 off the room price (which we ended up having to pay for while we stayed in the hospital). Lastly, when we went to leave and claim any comp we had for gambling, while we didn't gamble much (due to our wonderful stay at Sunrise Hospital) we found out at the Player's Club that the pit boss that entered our play completely screwed us and put us in as playing $12 an hour, and let me tell you we lost a lot more than that between the tables and slot machines. So we ended up not getting any comp. And the 'representative' at the Player's Club just told us basically 'touch luck'. Overall this is a decent hotel for families. The rooms are great, awesome bathrooms (in the suite at least) and I actually liked the fact that it was a little bit seperated from the strip. Oh and you will definitely hear the planes taking off and landing...so if noise is a problem, don't stay on the strip view side of the hotel. The airport is right next to the hotel. If you are a couple looking for a romantic vacation, skip Mandalay and try the Paris or the Wynn. One last thing....if you want to use the gym...be willing to pay $30 a day."

The breakfast buffet had a good selection of food and we didn't have to wait in line. It was worth the $40.00 cost for my husband and I to eat breakfast there. Our hotel floor had a wonderful view of the Vegas strip. It was really beautiful to watch the Vegas strip light-up at night! Taxis were easy to find with very little wait. A Taxi ride to the airport cost $16.00, which didn't seem too bad. It's also easy to walk to the bus stop for the Deuce bus ($3.00 each way) that travels down the Vegas strip. Negatives: Most of the negatives are \"little things\" and don't detract too much from an overall good experience. However, here are the negatives: Any service like the gym, spa, or room service is way too expensive. Small purchase like snacks or toothpaste downstairs are overpriced. Sensodyne toothpaste was $14.00 and Sodas were $3.50 for 6-8 ounces! The soda machines by the room were slightly more reasonable at $2.00. The gym costs $30.00 a day for hotel guests~! There was no coffee machine or hot water machine for tea in the room. Also no refrigerator in the room. Room service coffee/tea was $7.50! It was just annoying to have to worry about little expenses during an otherwise good stay. The check-in process took too long at about 10 minutes per person. There was a fee for High speed internet of about $15.00 per day."

MB is nice, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. Notwithstanding my criticism, the pool area is pretty cool, for families or otherwise. There is a wave pool, and the \u201clazy river.\u201d This time visiting the pool area occurred over spring break, making me feel like I was on MTV (i.e. it was mostly all college kids), which made finding a chair really tough. I didn\u2019t like the room. I was with my husband, but if I was staying with a group of friends or family in the room, things could be restrictively uncomfortable. The room we were in wasn\u2019t huge \u2013 in the hallway leading from the entrance door into the room was a window into the bathroom. The window was glass, as was the shower door, so anyone walking into/out of the room would have to walk right by the window, which looks right into the bathroom (shower & bathtub included). So there's no privacy and no shades, etc to prevent the lack of privacy. Very strange! I've stayed in many hotels and have never seen this odd situation. Only in Vegas I guess. Unfortunately, that is not my only complaint with the room. As soon as we got into the room we noticed the toilet area reeked of urine. It was horrendous. I called to complain and the cleaning crew spent quite a bit of time trying to clean it up but were unable. So the bathroom, completely lacking in privacy, was also reeking of urine. In all fairness I did not complain again to hotel staff (that the smell remained despite a second cleaning), nor did I ask to be moved to another room (although I really wish I had now). It would've been nice for someone from the hotel to call and check we were satisfied, but that did not occur. On a positive note, if you\u2019re into working out or running and are cheap like me and don\u2019t want to pay extra to get some exercise, Mandalay Bay may be for you. Outside the pool area is a running/walking track, which was a huge bonus. (Most hotels in Vegas offer an area to workout for a fee; at MB you have an outdoor track, at the very least, for free.) As far as the hotel, I had no complaints with the casino itself. In fact, it seemed easier & quicker to get a drink while I was gambling there, than in any other casino I visited on this trip. And I must say, the staff was better than average in friendliness & helpfulness. We did the brunch buffet, which I would not recommend. It wasn\u2019t cheap and wasn't great."

We had just a basic room with 2 beds and it was a great size. We had a great view of the pool. House of Blues restaurant is great for breakfast. We didn't try it for any other meal. Red, White and Blue restaurant was not good for breakfast. It had a very limited menu and was extremely expensive. The pool was very busy and unless you get there before noon you won't find a chair unless you walk around awhile and wait for people to leave. The pool temps were great. The lazy river is a lot of fun. It has a strong current so you don't need a tube to go around. This hotel is on the south end of the strip so we spent a bit of money taking taxis to the other hotels. The tram was working when we were there and it would take you to the Luxor or Excalibur. Zumanity by Cirque de Soleil was awesome! It was playing at New York New York. Dian Diaz was playing at the JPop lounge. Free music and she was great! I would stay at this hotel again but I just wish it was more in the middle of the strip."

    "content": "My husband and I wanted to try Mandalay Bay this year after staying at Four Seasons last year; we read here at Trip Advisor that MB was just as nice as Four Seasons and much less expensive. The niceness factor was certainly true. We found our room modern, beautifully decorated, sparkling clean, and spacious (and this was a room booked with a bargain fly/stay deal). We especially liked the bathroom layout which featured a separate shower and tub, two sinks and a separate toilet room. The living space was more interesting and just as nice, as FS. Unfortunately, MB is a much noisier hotel. This seems to be because it attracts a younger, party crowd, and the wall insulation seems to be missing. After checking in (long lines but efficient), I navigated my luggage through large groups of people who congregated at the elevator portals and took the elevator to the 8th floor. As I got off the elevator, I was pleased to see that my room number was at the end of a long hallway- wow! I was going to get a room away from the elevator even though I booked at a bargain price. My fantasy was dashed as I got closer to my room. At the end of the long hallway was a double door (a large suite?) that was vibrating from the loud music coming from inside. A group of four men emerged as we were putting the key into our door. Next to my room another loud party was taking place. Women were shrieking and screaming to their own party music. It was 5 PM. Once inside my own room, I wondered if the building had any insulation at all. I could hear the music and screaming from next door as if I were in the same room. Someone shrieked. Another person let out a \"Wooooo\" (Okay I am in Las Vegas- I reminded myself) Thankfully, we had many activities planned--we just hoped the party people would be passed out, checked out or asked out by the time we wanted to go to sleep. When we returned at 11 PM all was quiet. Then, we were awakened around 2 AM by another shout of \"Rock and Roll!\" in the hallway. We were awakened once again at 6 am with voices in the hallway - really bad insulation- Thankfully, the party groups must have checked out because the remaining four days were quiet at my end of the hallway: Four nights of very comfortable beds and peace and quiet. We only needed staff service once when the lightbulb in out bathroom went out; Housekeeping came and replaced it almost immediately. The elevators themselves were very efficient. Our room was straightened and cleaned each day in a way that made it a pleasure to return to. Clearly, hotel management cares about their hotel. Overall, I would highly recommend the hotel if the insulation weren't so awful. Recommendation to hotel management- Ask guests if they are partying and put them all on the same floor!"

    "from": 721,

    "date": "April 8, 2009",
    "content": "We stayed at the Mandalay Bay for 3 nights from 4/2-4/5 2009. We chose the Mandalay Bay because we were bringing our children (ages 10 and 13) to Vegas and needed hotel where they would also have activities. We were WOWed by our experience at the Mandalay. ROOMS We had a standard deluxe room on the 27th floor. The room was much larger than a typical hotel room at 550 square feet. What I loved most was that we had two queen beds, when most hotels only give you two doubles. The room was spacious and large, with two chairs ( I love when there are 2 chairs if you want room service) at the desk and a sitting chair in the room. The furnishings were updated and new, with no \u201cworn bedspreads\u201d here. The room was immaculate and clean. They have a large flat panel TV and internet for a fee of $14.95 for a 24 hour period at a time. Being charged for internet in your room is pretty customary, so it didn\u2019t bother us. Both of us brought our laptops and it allowed us both to have connectivity simultaneously. BATHROOM I have to admit that my favorite part of the room was the bathroom. With granite countertops and travertine stone the bathroom feels luxurious. The bathroom has double sinks, with tons of space on either side of the sinks. The counter was huge. There is a separate room for the toilet, a dedicated glass shower enclosure and a separate large soaking tub. The water pressure in the shower was terrific with tons of hot water. At one point we had someone in the shower and someone filling the tub, neither child ran out of water! A nice touch in the bathroom is the small flat screen TV so that you can listen to the news while getting ready. There is also a phone in the toilet area\u2026in case you really need it. GROUNDS The Mandalay Bay is a huge complex and has an incredible pool. From all my research it is hands down the \u201cbest pool\u201d in Vegas We chose this hotel due to the pool area. There is a huge wave pool with the most attentive life guards I have ever seen. Children under 48 inches are not allowed in the wave pool without a parent. They even pulled my son out of the water to measure him on a stick they have. Although the wave pool doesn\u2019t generate big enough waves to truly body surf or boogie board, it\u2019s still fun to get tossed around in the waves. They also have a fun lazy river that does a gentle loop, 2 other \u201cregular\u201d pools and 3 hot tubs. You can rent tubes to float in the lazy river, but you CANNOT bring tubes or floating devices from home to use. It was spring break and so there were hoards of 20 something year olds. The 20 year olds all hang out in front of the huge wave pool. If you want a quieter surroundings, most of the older guests (older than 20) were on lounge chairs around the lazy river or around the other two smaller pools. We should have done this. You do need your room key to gain access to the Pool area, so don\u2019t forget this. They also keep the pool towels in the pool area. They won\u2019t let you bring them back to the room, so make sure you have a coverup or prepare for that. PARKING Valet parking is free or you can self park. We tried both. When you first check into the hotel, it is much easier to pull up, unload your bags, and have someone take your car for you. If you decide to self park initially upon check in it is a bit of a hassle. You will have to find self parking, unload, take an elevator to the main level, walk through the entire huge casino dragging your suitcases (this takes at least 3-5 mins to walk through the casino as it is huge) until you reach check in. Since Valet service is free, we just did Valet service to check in. When you call down to have your car brought out by valet, they have you meet them at a different location than the front lobby. To get to self parking you drive to the Mandalay Bay and instead driving to the front of ht hotel, you drive under the cross over bridge called the \u201cMandalay Place\u201d. Basically it is a bridge in between Mandalay and the Luxor. You drive under this and look for signs that say \u201cValet West\u201d and \u201cSelf Parking\u201d. You will be turning left. Once you park you take an elevator to the lobby and then the elevators up to your room. There were always plenty of spaces in the \u201cself park\u201d. FOOD We had room service 3 times and ate at Areole in the hotel. Areole had wonderful food and they have a fixed price menu. For $55 you got to choose and appetizer, main and dessert, for $79 you received the same, but chose from a slightly larger menu. For about $100 you had a tasting menu of about ten items. None of these prices included wine, from which they have an impressive collection. The room service was great. You must remember that you are at a 4 star property so nothing is cheap. My son ordered the appetizer of chicken tenders and it came with exactly 4 pieces and nothing more\u2026the cost $16. So just be prepared. This is the Mandalay Bay and this is Las Vegas. They do charge you a per person fee of $5 for each person ordering room service and tax. But it didn\u2019t look like they included a customary 18% tip, so we always tipped our attendant additionally. For the property size, they were very attentive. Our room service was more than the time of 45 minutes and so at 40 minutes we received a call letting us know it would be slightly longer. It made us feel less There are also 2 food courts right across the walkway at the LUXOR and then right across their walkway to the Ecalibur. At the Excalibur they have a Mcdonalds, Pizza hut, Quiznos and Crispy Cr\u00e8me. The prices are higher than your neighborhood McDonalds by maybe 40%. But it\u2019s a great option for families. LOCATION For some, they may find the southern most section of the strip less desirable, but it was actually perfect if you have children. Las Vegas isn\u2019t really for kids. The only hotels that had anything remotely interesting to children were the Mandalay, Luxor, Excalibur (Has a children\u2019s arcade), MGM and New York New York. All of these hotels are next to each other with an indoor walk through from the Mandalay to the Luxor and Luxor to Excalibur. Also, a free tram takes you from the Mandalay to the Luxor to the Excalibur. So we found it absolutely ideal and where we wanted to be."

From the initial interenet booking direct with the hotel, through our late arrival (24hrs) due to Virgin Atlantic's ageing planes, up until the checkout, the hotel can only be praised. The room was extremely well presented, excellant fixtures and fittings with an overall sense of class and style. The Casino itself all though sometimes large and impersonal, is very clean and freindly. Having signed up for our MGM Players card, we managed to get free meals in the hotel and coffee's from Starbucks all for playing under $50 a day in slots. Whilst the location may seem a little distant at the south end of the strip, the new Town Square shopping complex is very close (walking distance) and the tram connecting the Luxor and Excalibur make moving around very easy. The pool scene is excellant and offers a nice break from the heavy nights on the casino floor. Reception and Maid service was superb and a credit to the hotel also. Having stayed in the MGM, Treasure Island and Luxor this hotel stands out and I would recommend the Manadaly to anyone."

    "date": "April 1, 2009",
    "content": "This was our first time to Vegas (my husband and myself), and we chose the Mandalay Bay based on the price of a package we received through a travel agent. We also read previous reviews and knew it was a nice, newer hotel. We really enjoyed our stay here. We stayed March 8-13. We checked in early on a Sunday, and had no issues getting a room. We requested a King room, away from elevators on a higher floor, with a view of the strip. We got 3 of the 4 requested- only thing we couldn\u2019t get was the king bed so we got two queen beds. If we waited a few hours we could have had a King but we wanted to get into the room. We were on the 18th floor with a beautiful view of the strip. The room was one of the nicest rooms we have ever stayed in. The big tub was a nice treat after all the walking, the double sinks were perfect for us. Bed was very comfortable, pillows could have been better. A few minuses about the room itself- the doors slammed loudly, so you could hear other people going in and out of their rooms. The toilet was very loud when flushed. The TV did not allow you to hook up a camera (we often do when we visit hotels to look at the pictures we have taken- it had hook ups but there was a block on the TV). The \u2018minibar\u2019 fridge- we didn\u2019t realize that it was computerized, and if you take something out you are automatically billed. We got to the room and took an item out to replace it with a bottled water we already paid for. When my husband went to get it the next day, he read the small print inside the fridge, which explained how the billing worked. We called the front desk and they explained that someone comes to the room to check if anything is missing; if everything is there we won\u2019t be billed. Luckily we weren\u2019t billed, but we weren\u2019t crazy about this. I hear this is common in most Vegas rooms. We made sure to use the ice bucket the rest of the trip. Also for some reason someone brought a baby to Vegas and it was crying every morning at 6am. The walls were thin enough for us to hear this in the morning. The hotel itself was beautiful. We went into every major hotel/casino in the strip, and we thought Mandalay was one of the nicest, up there with Bellagio, Wynn, Venetian and Encore. It is 10 years old but everything looked brand new to us. It is huge, the casino was nicely spaced, and you didn\u2019t have to walk through the casino to get to your room like most hotels. Everyone was extremely nice, making sure to say hello as they walked by. We have never gotten this experience at a hotel before so we were very satisfied with the customer service. Only small issue we had with someone was the first time we went to get our valet car. We gave the man our keys and we thought he said up the escalator to the left. He talked very fast and under his breath. We went back upstairs and waited for 5 minutes until my husband asked someone, and they said we have to go back down where we came from. We went down there, and the doors leading outside only said \u2018Baggage pickup\u201d nothing about car pick up. This is why we were confused. When my husband went to the same man, he said \u201cwhere have you been, we\u2019ve been paging you forever.\u201d My husband told him we were confused, and he said \u201cI thought I was pretty clear.\u201d That was the only bad encounter we had with someone working in the hotel. A few minuses for the hotel overall- there are no \u2018cheap\u2019 eating options inside the hotel. Vegas is extremely expensive, and the food is overpriced most places on the strip. The cheapest option in the hotel was Red, White and Blue, for two sandwiches, a soda and bottled water, it was $35, and it was horrible. We noticed in MGM they had a food court with cheaper options- it would have been nice to have this at Mandalay Bay. And once you are in your room for the night, you don\u2019t feel like taking a long walk or a taxi to a cheaper alternative. The hotel is also the last major hotel on the strip, which is good when you want to get to the airport fast and if you want to be away from the crowds. This wasn\u2019t an issue for us and we liked the privacy, but if you like to be in the middle of everything, this isn\u2019t the best hotel for you. We walked the first night from Mandalay to Bellagio and back- this was a big mistake- lots of walking and it was very cold at night. We were exhausted. Plus the free tram from the hotel to Excalibur was shut down for repairs, so we had to walk the whole distance. And another mistake we made was taking the Deuce bus one night to Freemont Street. It took over an hour to get there after all the stops. We didn\u2019t take the rental car because we heard the area over there wasn\u2019t the best, but if you have a car we suggest driving, and there is a parking garage that brings you right out to Freemont Street. Don\u2019t take the bus, it\u2019s cheap but it will take a lot of your time. So overall the hotel was modern, people were friendly, and rooms were very nice. Needs more inexpensive eating options, better signage at valet, and could be an inconvenient location for certain travelers. If you want a great view of the strip, check out Mix lounge before it turns into a club at 10pm. We went in, had two drinks, an appetizer and dessert (over $50- I said it was expensive) but we had a nice seat with a beautiful view of the strip. This was a much nicer view than the Paris experience, which was $10 each but when you get to the top it is fenced in so if you want pictures this is not the place to go. Also another great place to eat in Mandalay was the Border Grill, the food was worth the price (and it was one of the cheaper eating options in the hotel). Stay away from the Bayside Buffet, very small and not worth the breakfast cost of $15 each. Bellagio Buffet breakfast was about the same cost but much more variety for your money. House of Blues was great for breakfast as well inside Mandalay, and Burger bar offered a Kobe beef burger that was excellent and didn\u2019t cost and arm and a leg. This is located inside Mandalay place, a shopping mall connecting Mandalay and Luxor. Bring a lot of money if you are eating on the strip, it is expensive. Also be prepared to tip everyone from bell service, room service, housekeeping, valet parking, taxi stands, etc. Everyone expects a tip. Hope this review helps!"

As the casino's are now linked internally you can go through the Man Bay, Luxor, Excalibur and NY NY in around 15mins. So don't let the fact that it is a little out of the action put you off staying here. Would stay here again."

    "content": "My husband and I just returned from Las Vegas and we had a great time. We stayed at the Mandalay Bay and I have to say it is one fabulous hotel. Our room was just the way it appeared on the virtual tour and it had a wall safe so that help set me at ease. The only problem was at night the air condition seem to cutt off so the room would get stuffy. Not sure if it was just our unit but it happened all three nights. This made it uncomfortable to sleep in the middle of the night. We are both accustom to using ceiling fans. Anyway, the hotel has a vast amount of resturants to choose from which are grossly overpriced but hey you on vacation. The first night we ate at RedWhiteBlue- it was okay for a $16 cheeseburger. The next nite we ate at the wolfgang puck's Lupo. I highly recommend this restaurant. This was only $70 for the both of us you can't beat that since our breakfast was $50 in the Raffles Cafe. The raffles Cafe is much better than the buffett breakfast that we payed $35to eat at the day before. The food is fresher at Raffles and it was a good atomosphere to start the day. Although be careful of the $5 orange juice. The Last night we ate at the RM Seafood and it was phenomenal. The service was excellent and the bartender Tony was a pleasure! I highly recommend this restuarant you have to go up to the Mandaly Palace shopping area to find it but it is a find worth walking for. There is also a cute little Minus 5 ice bar that was alot of fun we watched some of the NCAA tournament there. We didn't win any money so i suggest going down the strip to some of the older hotels if you want to cash in big. I think everyone is holding on to what they got in vegas these days. Anyway, great hotel- great food- watch the prices??and great shopping int eh Palace. I wished I had one more day never got to enjoy the pool area but maybe next time."

Our room was lovely, a lot more modern than I was expecting and a big bathroom which made a change. Also we had a great view of the strip,. The hotel itself was absolutely huge, there were many many restaurants, we weren't there long enough to enjoy them all but the ones we did go to were fantastic, and not too expensive. The pool area was our favourite feature of this hotel. The centre piece was a huge wave pool complete with sandy beach, a lazy river in the middle of lush tropical scenery and many other pools as well. No other hotel we visited had nearly as good pool areas as this, so definately a must for families with children! Couldn't really fault this hotel at all, if we return to las vegas we will be coming back to this hotel!"

Check-in was easy, but they didn't have the requests I made over the phone saved. It wasn't a big deal, but we had to have a room with two queen beds instead of one king. The room was very spacious. We really liked the modern decor. It was clean except for a couple of spots on the carpet. The bed was great - very soft and comfortable. We spent a lot of time there. The front desk was accomodating. We realized at 2:30 am that we didn't have any toothpaste and they brought up two tubes very quickly. Room service was a little slow. It took us a little over an hour to get breakfast. It's easier to just take the elevator down to the one of the restaurants. Raffles serves breakfast 24/7, so that's always a good option. The hotel is at the south end of the Vegas strip. There is a deuce bus stop right in front of the hotel, though getting to the street can be a little tricky. An easier way to get down the strip is to take the free tram from Mandalay to the Excalibur. From there, you can walk or you can go across the street to the MGM Grand and catch the monorail. Overall we had a great time at the hotel and would definitely stay there again."

The reservation team were good, I kept e-mailing to update prices when they lowered and they were really great. With our wedding package we got the \"honeymoon\" suite, which was nice and big, but the location of the room was awful. The view was of a flat roof facing the airport but I wouldn't have minded except when I went to draw the curtains it was actually a wall, so we only had a slither of a window. I complained to the wedding co-ordinator because I needed the light for the wedding make-up and we got upgraded to a bigger and better room with a view. The rooms were of a good size and they were nice and clean, however I do have a few complaints. Firstly housekeeping would come extremely early (from 7.30am) shouting through the corridors and knocking on doors, the walls were very thin, there is no coffee/tea facilities (they charged one of my guests who fell ill over $5 for a cup of hot water), you have to pay $25 to use the gym daily and finally the service was appalling. I know we went during their peak period, New Year, but the queues to check-in and out were ridiculous and not all the counters were staffed. Also I wanted to borrow scissors to cut some ribbon for wedding things and they would not loan me a pair...they said it was for safety reasons, but I could go to the gift shop to purchase them! So I went to the Four Seasons next door where we had our wedding reception and they gladly gave a pair to us. Before going to Vegas we were excited to stay in this hotel but overall we were very disappointed, especially since we told all our guests to stay there. I wouldn't stay in this hotel again, there are better hotels in Vegas which value customer service and do not rely just on the name."

FOOD: Food and room service was right on point. We especially enjoyed the 'China Grill' and their Creme Brulee.....my fav. Definitely what I would expect from this resort."

We booked a suite for 3 people and found out when we arrived that they would be charging us extra for a cot. When we booked a room for 3 people wouldn't it be logical to expect sleeping arrangements for everyone in the room? This hotel is at the end of the strip and not exceptionally busy. If you are looking for action or night life this is not for you. The pool and beach area are nice especially if you have kids."

Although our flight arrived mid-morning, we were able to check in to the hotel several hours ahead of the stated 3PM check in time. Checkout was also fast and easy - done on-line in the room. The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Our room (28th floor) was comfortable and had a nice view looking south over the pool area. We enjoyed several meals at restaurants on site - there are a wide variety to choose from. The food was outstanding at all of them. The only \"complaint\" I had was that the tram running between Excalibur and Mandalay Bay was not running. This property is at the far South end of the Las Vegas Strip, so it's quite a hike to anywhere else. It looks like the repairs were in process, so I'm hoping it's working next time. You can walk indoors through Luxor to Excalibur, but the weather was so nice we decided to walk outside. I would certainly stay here again!"

The Mandalay Bay has a large selection of restaurants and bars. They have bands playing in the casino free of charge. The hotel is connected by a walkway and tram to the Luxor and they have a stop for the Deuce bus out the front. Overall I found the MB to be a very beautiful hotel.

The pool is great. It has real sand, but since we were there in June it was super crowded. Get there early and save seats for your friends! Also, it is QUITE a walk to any of the other hotels, although you can take the tram to NYNY and walk the rest of the way. If you want to go to the Bellagio, Caesars or Venetian...take a cab!"

It was very dim, with little to no decor. The front desk said that they did not have any queen rooms left to move us to. So we decided to make the best of it...until the room started smelling of cigarette smoke. After calling back the front desk, they upgraded us to a queen suite room. Once again, the room was dim, but better than the first room. The room had the bare minimum amenities, and Mandalay Bay charges for EVERYTHING. The bed was on the lumpy side. The bathroom was nice, with a very nice shower and soaking tub. The room itself required more decor. It was very drab. The pool is very nice and spacious. There are a lot of different things to do poolside (i.e. casino, bars, etc.) On our next trip to Vegas, we will most likely stay at another hotel."

There is a soaking tub and separate shower. The TV is not needed, but it is nice to watch TV while soaking in a bubble bath. The bed is comfortable. The main TV is nice and huge.

I told them about the other room and they found that both were booked under the same ladies name. In short, they would not switch the reservation from her name to mine. Instead they create a new reservation at the same rate in my name. Then they go ahead and charge our company one nights stay for her room. Why???? They did not lose any business. The room they gave me was the same room at the same rate. They were just too inflexible to switch the name on the room so they could get another $229 nights stay.

Long walk to center of activity. 2. Internet access $15 per day (if you bring your laptop) $1 per minute if you use their computers. 3. Food, convenience store items, mini bar items all unreasonably priced. (e.g. $12 for about 10 small chocolate chip cookies in room). 4. We were told that the king size bed we paid for was not available. They told us that they were going to give us two queen size beds...they were actually full beds. Not a catastrophe, but suboptimal. Tips: 1. Do NOT do express checkout. Check your bill. We were charged for a minibar item we certainly did not use. We were told that the bar items had sensors on them. Huh??? 2. Eat elsewhere. We had a $40 breakfast that was particularly unimpressive (not as good as Denny's). Better food at better prices to be found elsewhere. (e.g. Tropicana has a 2 lobster tail dinner for $19.95...real deal...no strings attached...delicious). 3. If you need convenience store items (toothbrush, snacks, eye drops) consider walking across the street (prices quite reasonable there). 4. If you need to access the internet consider one of the cafes at the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops or Tropicana ($5 for 20 minutes). We did not: 1. See the shark reef aquarium (went to see the lion at MGM Grand)...very cool and free. 2. Use the pool (the weather was not conducive)."

We also had to ask for the general hotel information that is normally in rooms. For some reason ours did not have it. Took two days to finally get it. Not familiar with vegas hotels and charges, but there was an extra fee of $30 to use the excercise room, and it didn't appear to be that special. I thought it should be included. Food was nice, I would recommend Raffles over the Buffet. It is adjacent to the Mandalay place shops, however they really did not impress me. However, it was nice to be able to walk around and explore something other than the casino. It is connected to both the Luxor and Excaliber so you can go exploring without having to go outside, and for a quick meal the Excaliber does offer a food court."

The best bar was at THEHotel, the hotel on the top floor had an amazing view up the strip, it was never busy when he went and seems a bit of a hidden gem. The room was amazing, really nice. I did notice that bins didn't always get changed, floors not hoovered and sheets not changed on the bed (we were there for 10 nights!).

Room was spacious and clean and, overall, the resort was clean with no overwhelming smell of stale smoke, even in the casino. Asked for a small fridge which was deliverer promptly and at no extra charge. No robes in the room but were supplied when requested. All but one pool closed for the season and weather did not encourage dipping in the water - too cold, even for us northern types! Despite being able to find a good room rate, this was not an inexpensive week as food and drink were very pricey \u2013 burger at Red White and Blue $15, salad at Red Square $15. This was not unique to the Mandalay Bay but it was disappointing that at a reception with a cash bar a glass of pop was $5! Had a good meal at RumJungle- the Brazilian Rodizio-style \u201cfire-pit\u201d -very tasty and enough food. Was a bit disappointed with the attitude of a couple of the people at the concierge desk - not very helpful and one even downright grumpy - quite a contrast to the service at the Luxor next door and at the Bilagio.

I don't think they care if you ever come back. Examples? How about the internet access fee of $15 per day? (There are internet computers in the lobby which accept up to $20 bills for timed sessions.) Or the mini-bar on the credenza loaded with high-priced snacks and souvenir items, which you will in fact purchase if you so much as pick them up. Want in-room coffee? Not a chance, unless it comes from room service. Exercise equipment is available in the spa for \"members\" who have paid a fee. On the plus side, our rooms were spacious, had very comfortable beds and pillows, a big screen TV and good room-darkening shades. Big closets too. And a small flat-screen TV in the bath. Nice. The staff were mostly competent, efficient and pleasant to deal with. But this enormous property has no seating AT ALL in the lobby, not even bench seats. For the elderly or handicapped, this is a disaster. There are dozens of upscale retail shops and restaurants but everything is a long walk, except the casino which is steps from the elevators. Along the concourses to shops and restaurants there are rare benches scattered, and there are a few near the Shark Reef exhibit, but generally the seating opportunities are few and far between. Even the pool/beach area is a long trek, as you search for the one your hotel key will let you in to. Of course, plenty of seats are available in the casino and in the restaurants, areas where you will be spending. If you need a wheelchair or a scooter, as a valued guest the hotel will rent them to you. I think the wheelchair was also $15 a day. Since the hotel is at the end of the strip and right across from the airport, you gain a little noise and lose viewing the \"Times Square-ish\" hustle and bustle of the Strip. You also become isolated and will find you must take cabs to go anywhere. Many people like to cruise Las Vegas Blvd and check out some of the other hotels & casinos or take in a show, but that is impossible for handicapped or elderly guests at the MB unless you take a taxi."

    "content": "Our first trip to Vegas! My wife and I made a last minute reservation at the Mandalay Bay. Found a very good price ($99/night) for such a nice hotel. Upon arriving, we were amazed by the extravagance of this hotel (and all the others in Vegas - wow!). Very fast, efficient and friendly check-in. Our room was ready before published check-in time, and was very nice. Fairly large room, comfortable bed, and very nice bathroom (watch TV from the tub!). Only thing that wasn't to my desires was our view - we were looking back - toward \"TheHotel\", and therefore did not have a view of the strip (could see about 1/2 of the Luxor). Casino was very nice - staff was very helpful, from the sports bookies to the waitresses. Restaurants are very expensive! I had looked forward to trying a couple of the nicer locals, but was unwilling to pay the steep prices. Did not find a mid or low cost option in the Mandalay. For the late night craving, we'd walk over to the Luxor to hit Quizno's or McDonalds. Rented a car from a desk right in the basement of the Mandalay - very convinient, was able to turn the car in at the airport saving a cab-fare. Overall, very nice hotel and enjoyed our time in Vegas. Will go back."

    "content": "This was my third visit to LV. I've stayed at Caesar's and MGM Grand previously, and the rooms at Mandalay Bay were far superior. The others have the typical basic hotel rooms that you find in any hotel. But the standard rooms at Mandalay Bay were much larger than normal with modern decor, large plasma tv, big desk, sofa, chaise, and very comfortable bed. The bathroom is fantastic with a double sinks, separate tube and shower, and an lcd tv. The only issue with the room is lack of a free coffee maker. And if you're a light sleeper, try to avoid the side that faces the airport - you can hear the planes taking off. The casino itself is great, but it's on the far south end of the strip, so not a great location if you want to be right in the middle of the action. But it has a good selection of restaurants/shops and we preferred the fact it seemed a little more peaceful here. If you have a car and plan to visit places outside the strip this is a great base. The highway to Hoover Dam and Red Rock Canyon, the famous Welcome to LV sign, and the outlet mall are all just south of the hotel on Las Vegas Blvd. And because of the location, the traffic is much better."

    "content": "We stayed at the Mandalay Bay for 2 nights after switching from the run down Monte Carlo. Let me just say that compared to the Monte Carlo our room at Mandalay Bay was the Taj Mahal. We were on the top floor and our room had floor to ceiling windows with a view of the strip. Let me just rave about the beds for a moment here, indulge me if you will. They were heavenly and I wish every hotel room had beds like these. They had tons of pillows, a down duvet and down mattress pad. The room was spotless and very modern. The flat screen TV in the room was huge (for hotel standards). The lighting was really nice and I did not feel like I was in a dungeon, as I have felt in other Vegas hotel rooms. The bathroom was also very nice and had a separate tub and shower, and toilet room. There was also a TV in it so you could watch TV as you get ready. The only problem with the bathroom? If you are traveling with people that you would not like to see you shower than you will have to close the double doors with a towel in it as there is a sizable gap in-between the doors. We did not use this casino or really even look around the hotel. We mainly just slept here and then left to Mt. Charleston for family activities. For those of you that don\u2019t know, 30 minutes from the strip is Mt. Charleston and it is beautiful and in the winter has tons of snow. My in-laws live there and will probably not be too happy I am giving up this secret but for those that get sick of the partying (is that possible?) drive up to the mountain - you take the freeway heading to Utah. It is worth the trip! We loved that this hotel is right off of a freeway exit, this was very convenient. The only problem with the self parking garage is that it is a long walk to the elevators to the room. Do yourself a favor and valet. We will definitely stay here again in the future!"

(Towels were needed due to the fact my room was never cleaned for the day.) The Gym/Spa is 30$/a day to use. EXPENSIVE. The restuarants and bars nearby are great.

I travel for business and often only pay $100 a night for a room and I always have a personal fridge and coffee pot without an up charge and those rooms are never this much square feet. Paying that type of money I expected a lot more for the money. We happened to see a room in THEhotel, it was a smaller suite but beautiful and newer furnishings. They also pampered the guest with slippers and a robe. The bathroom light was very poor."

The bed was super soft with an additional pillow top. I like firm beds so this feature wasn't that great for me. There was a flat screen tv as well. Lots of noise from the hallway can be heard in the bedroom so hopefully you aren't next to any loud partiers. We weren't so it was nice and quiet for us. The best way to get around the strip is to take the tram to excalibur, walk across the street to MGM and by a day pass for the monorail ($12 per pass per person). The pass is good for a 24 hour period not by date. Go to Encore if you can. It's beautiful and very busy. A younger, more trendy crowd there. Mandalay has many food options, but we only tried three - the Noodle Shop, rm seafood, and Red White Blue. I would not eat at Red White Blue again but the noodle shop was pretty good. WE didn't eat enough at RM to properly review it. I've also eaten at Burger Bar which is fairly tasty, any topping you can imagine and more. I've stayed here at the Mandalay in the summer time and the pool is spectacular when it's open. All in all, I would stay here again."

The hotel is right at the end of the strip (south) and is quite a walk if you want to walk along the strip but we just used the monorail which is quick. We went in august and the weather was very hot over 100 every day but the hotels swimming pool is excellent looks just like a beach with a wave machine. Casino is massive lots of slots and tables never had to wait. Overall Fantastic hotel and would definitely recommend."

No real direction or explanation was given so we took it upon ourselves to call Mandalay Bay. The had decided to accomodate all the The Hotel guests who were inconvenienced. They wanted to give me a regular room for the same price, and that's when I lost it. If I wanted a regular room at MB I could've paid half of that, so I demanded adjoining rooms. They finally gave in. Later I heard they were comping other guest's stays and offering them 400-500 dollar credits for their inconvenience. Anyway, casino was dead....no bells ringing here...I guess the economy is really bad there too. Not too smokey on the higher levels. Kids liked the Shark Reef. 30 dollar buffet was not really so great, and not worth it. Rooms were nice thought, with tv's in the bathroom, and plenty of closet space. Overall I give it a 7, maybe an 8 if it were warm enough to use the pools."

We had a rental car, and because we were tired from traveling, I decided to Valet. Well, the valet line was not moving, I sat for over 15 minutes, and people in front of me were getting out of their cars and yelling, and I swear some just left their cars without getting a ticket. Finally a man came buy and apologized for the delay, and said the line would move soon. I'm not sure what the problem was, but I was glad it got resolved finally. Since the wait had taken so long, I had sent others from my group on to check in. I finally walked into the lobby, and found my friends. They were in the process of checking in, and the receptionist was very cold and impersonal. We were excited, our first time here, and she was having none of it, just very to the point, bland, not even a smile..well great, welcome to vegas! We got to our room, and it was pretty nice, I'll give them that. We had 2 queen beds, a very nice flat screen tv, and the bathroom was huge. The beds were very comfortable, if you like soft fluffy beds. Others are correct in saying that the walls are thin, there was plenty of noise each night that we were able to hear, and at 8 am on Monday morning the staff starting doing something with a hammer in the room above us, it started at 9 am the next day. It was a huge problem, since we had been up late both of the previous nights. We ate at the buffet one day, I found the staff to be very slow to response, but there was a nice selection of food. We at around 11, so they were switching from breakfast to lunch, but we got the breakfast rate. I'm not sure I would have been happy if I had paid much more than we did for what was available, but all in all it was okay. The dealers at the tables were hit and miss, some very friendly, others with the same attitude as the check in clerk, cold and impolite. All in all, it was a good trip, and I'm glad we went, but if I go back I'll stay somewhere else. I'd take a smaller room for a little bit friendlier staff, and better customer service."

Just the free suite upgrade alone was worth it!. The room was spacious, designed in a square area rather than rectangular so it makes it bigger than what it is. Actually we were initally assigned one in the 60th floor, same 750 GR suite but in an L-shape pattern. Turned out our next door were noisy so we asked to be moved and they put us in this 18th floor square-type room. So there were actually two room designs for the 750 Suite, the square layout is so much better, the entrance is wider and you can see everything in your room, even talk to your other half while s/he's in the bathroom. I like this room slightly better than the palazzo's though the lighting could be slightly better. We ate at three of the restaurants (Raffles Cafe, the buffet, Red White & Blue) and all were fantastic. Great selection of restaurants in the hotel. One pool and one hot tub was open during our stay but the pool did not seem to be heated. Great tropical scenery and landscaping. This hotel IMO is a true 4.5 star hotel. Lower than Palazzo, Wynn but significantly better than MGM, Mirage, Paris. I'd rate it the same as Red Rock. If you can get a good deal like I did at this hotel go for it. I heard the regular rooms are also nice. All the rooms were renovated just two years ago."

We stayed 2 nights at MGM Grand after MB and MB is nicer. Parking is not too far of a walk. A few minor negatives are location (MB is at the south end of the strip) and no place to sit in the lobby. The bed is extremely soft, if you like sleeping on a very soft bed. Front desk was fairly indifferent during check-in."

From the moment we landed at the airport and could see our hotel from the window of our aeroplance we began to get excited, and we were not disapointed. The lobby was calm and organised (look at other vegas hotels and see how important this is). Our room was just a standard room, the cheapest you can get but it was fabulous. Two queen beds, plenty of space and a separate shower/bathroom and toilet. You will not be disapointed. We had gone to Las Vegas for the Marathon so obviously this was a great choice for us as the marthon started and finished at the mandaly. We were so impressed with Vegas that we plan to go back for our 50th birthday celebrations with our girlfriends (we are two females). During our stay in Vegas we visited all the major hotels and were impressed by them all. We would still come back to the Mandalay Bay. It it at the beginning of the strip so it may be neglected by some, DO NOT IGNORE THIS HOTEL. There is a bus, the DUECE that picks up and departs from just outside the hotel all day long. $5 for 24 hours, well worth the money. Up and down the strip all day and all night. We loved the Belagio and the Wynn and maybe if we had the money for the Wynn we may have stayed there but honestly we cold not fault the Mandaly. The HOTEL next door has a bar on the 64th floor, a must!!"

I had to listen to a baby scream every morning at 4:15 am on one side of me, while the folks in the other room were partying all night and tugging on the ajoining room door to get into my room. I ordered a fruit and cheese platter from room service (for the bargain price of $24.00). What I got in my \"fruit and cheese platter\" was one piece of fruit (otherwise know as \"garnish\") a strawberry sliced in two for my friend and I to share! There was ample cheese and crackers, and bottled water is $4.00 and a glass of wine $15.00. Crazy! I was disappointed in the noise level in the spa and the idea of presenting the client with a \"checkout ticket\" in the treatment room is very tacky. I usually give my therapist a cash tip, but since I had to checkout in my treatment room, that wasn't an option as my purse was in my locker. I did recieve a nice treatment, and my therapist was very attentive to my needs. Given the fact that there are so many choices in Las Vegas, these things should be taken into consideration if management wants guests to have \"an experience\" and not just \"a stay\"."

They have the Shark Reef but you can stay anywhere and drive to it. For business though this is a great hotel to stay at. It's by far the best rooms I've been in. I should know since I'm out there twice a month for a few days each time. If it's not the time of the year to swim I don't recommend it for a family. I have two kids under four.

The bell staff and room service staff were wonderful: they arrived sooner than they promised and went above and beyond in all cases. Some of the best service i have seen any place I have stayed for business or pleasure. I thought the food was reasonably priced and a good value for the money paid. Since we were only staying to see the show, we have no exposure to the other amenities and services. Based on my first Mandalay visit, I would highly recommend it to others. We plan to return in a few months to see the \u201cLion King:, which will replace \u201cMama Mia\u201d, and to see the \u201cHuman Body\u201d exhibition in the Luxor (right next door)."

One of those rooms that they get to call a suite by putting double doors between sleeping and bathroom area. The bed was the highlight. It was very very comfortable. My wife learned not to move the bottles in the mini bar to put her soda pop insideThere are micro switches under the bottles and when you lift one up it gets billed to your credit card. However they did immediatly remove the charges when i alerted them. The service and wait staff are friendly enough and they do seem to want you to enjoy yourself. The place is massive, and if you have a little trouble walking a long ways, you may want to make sure your room is close to the elevators, Our room was at the very end of the hall and it seemed like it added a half mile more just to get to the lobby casino area lol. Being at the end of the strip, the casino was dead compared to the hotels in the middle. So when we were there the night life was non existent If you were looking for full night clubs, you had the place to yourself, which i found odd and frankly kind of boring.Also the pools were all closed except one that you needed a taxi to get to it seemed.We went to the aquarium and that was fun and interesting."

Some weeks before my trip, MB introduced a promo pay 1 nt get 1 free, so I called the hotel and asked for having this promotion applied to my reservation. They said OK, we can do this. Great beginning. Arrived at the hotel at 1 p.m., my room was not ready. At 3 p.m. they gave me the key saying cleaning was actually in progress, and that I was been upgraded to a media suite (normally rated over 500$). I' ve been able to enter in my room at 4 p.m. The room was absolutely gorgeous. A large foyer with a secondary bathroom, an enormous living room with kitchenette area and a first plasma tv. A separate room with a second tv (very large, something about 60 inches I guess) with remote control for it, curtain, ipod, radio and so on. No DVD player (curious in a media suite, 4 tv and no DVD) Bedroom with a third tv, walk-in closet, and an enormous bathroom with double sink, shower large enough for 4 people, jacuzzi, small lcd tv and separate powder room. Very, very beautiful. Problems started when I had to re-enter in room. Key didn't work. Back at the registration desk, they said the problem is that I paid one night and not the second (I left 200$ cash deposit for incidental and not a credit card). I said Yes, but I have a promo, I don't have to pay the second. The lady spoke to the manager and it's seemed all right. I re-entered in my room. When I tried to re-enter later, the key didn't work again. I went to the registration desk. I had to do this four times total, until someone discovered that, although I had not to pay the second night, I had still to pay it then have a refund when checking-out... OMG! Payed the difference between my cash deposit and room rate, back in room. Next time, still my key not working... This time, a manager said me that key was ok, so maybe was a lack of batteries in the door system. They would have fixed it. Well, finally, after my 5th or 6th trip to the lobby, I was able to use my key normally. What can I say? In any other occasion, I would have rated lower for this issues (not nice going up and down several times, especially at night). But, 180$ a night for an amazing, beautifully appointed, more than 1500 sq.f media suite... I can't rate lower than a 5!"

The decor, size, and the view was outstanding. I know we would probably never receive a deal like this again, but we would definately book into the Mandalay again because of the service, food, pleasant staff.

The d\u00e9cor was very modern, and the bathroom was phenomenal, equipped with a TV, and very clean. I booked the minimal room and found plasma TV\u2019s on the wall, and even a small LCD TV in the bathroom. The bed was very large and comfortable. The room was very clean overall. Check-in and check-out was a breeze, and the staff was by and large pretty friendly. The pool was closed while I was there, but it looked nice. The \u201cbeach\u201d was also closed, but then again it was too cold for the pool that week anyway. I ate at the buffet and would highly-recommend it if you like hot steamed crab legs. The Bayside Buffet was a decent-value for your money. I thought the other restaurants were over-priced too. They have a food court, but again the prices were outrageous and the food was below average. There\u2019s a Starbucks inside the hotel, which was a bonus. I recommend buying your drinks at the small supermarkets across the street from the hotel. I\u2019m surprised for such a grand hotel there were no coffee brewers in the rooms. The front desk told me I could rent a hot pot for $5. My other complaint was that internet access was ridiculously pricey, at $15 a day! It should only cost half that much, for the sluggish connectivity it offered. The price I paid was reasonable for it being on the Las Vegas strip. I would definitely consider staying here in the future. Overall, there was nothing particularly special about the hotel, besides that it housed a shark aquarium, which was also over-priced."

We arrived at 2:00 p.m. and our suite wasn't ready but they let us put our bags in the room anyway so we could get started on our vacation. Check-in was speedy and courteous. The casino must have a very good smoke filtering system because we weren't bothered at all by cigarettes. Our only complaint was that the drinks in the bars are way overpriced...be prepared. We also spent one afternoon at the pool. We really appreciated the fact that Mandalay Bay planted a large number of trees around the pool areas so you can get some shade if you need it. Some of the other hotels that we've stayed at don't and it's like being in a frying pan. We also found the elevators to be quick...I don't know why some other posters have said otherwise. We made use of the tram that connects MB with Excaliber a couple of times a day which cuts out some of the walking from casino to casino. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip and will definitely stay here again."

Maybe the other side of the hotel has a nice view of the strip. Business services were mediocre. I could not get wireless service in my room (not sure if it is available elsewhere).so I needed an enternet cable. The cable the hotel provides is only three feet long so it would not reach to the bed where I like to do most of my work. Fortunately I brought my own cable. The service itself is expensive - $14 a day if I recall right. The exercise center is expensive. They call it a 'spa' and charge $30 a day. I like to use a treadmill - I found using the spa worked out to about $1 a minute for me- wow - cheaper to play a slot. The location is very good - you can walk next door to the Luxor and you can also take a tram but the walk is short and there are a lot of speciality shops along the way. Good restaurants in the hotel and nearby. I liked the Noodle Shop near the elevators. There is a pretty decent snack/sundry shop too - where I can get my Cheeze-it fix. The beach pool is very very nice. Great for families. Access to the airport is easy - about a ten minute ride by car. I took a Shuttle from the airport - about $7 - a short wait and of course you need to be patient since it drops off at all the hotels (the hotel does not have its own shuttle). Plenty of parking if you have a car. The casino is average. There does not seem to be the same level of excitement as you would find in casinos farther down the Strip."

There was no atmosphere or vibe about the place (sounds corny I know but it was really odd). Other than waiters, no member of staff acknowledged your presence. The hotel was very well maintained but there was just no personality to the decor or common areas. Both guests and staff seem to move about the hotel with little or no interaction with each other. My room was spacious with a minimalist contemporary decor. The bed was comforatable. WIFI connection in room was good but expensive at $14.95 per day. I had room service one evening and the food was very good and reasonably priced. I had an evening meal at Shanghi Lillys (chinese) and it was very good, although a bit pricey. I thought the portions were such at if you had a lot of people, you could order 4 entrees for 6 people and have more than enough. A friend of mine went to the sushi bar and said it wasn't as good and the service was so-so. We also went to Rumjungle one night, and maybe a I am getting too old for that type of thing, but had someone else not been paying, I would not have stayed. I thought it was expensive and full of young stupid girls, who could not afford to be there, so they spent their time annoying any man who looked like they had money buy them drinks. I found the whole scene rather pathetic. Also did the buffet breakfast a few days, the guys seem to love it as they can eat all they want, but I thought the quality of the food was just ok. The pool was very large but I would recommend that you bring your own towel. The hotel does provide them but they are the dingiest white you have ever seen, The pool is designed to emulate a beach, so it has sand. The sand gets everywhere which I found annoying. There is cost of $16/day to rent a tube for the lazy river (outrageous) so spend $3 for your own prior to arrival. One last tip, there are plenty a shops at the Mandalay to buy snacks and drinks, but they are very expensive. If you are going to be outside the property, remember to pick-up water, etc from a local market. On the whole, nothing major to complain about, just nothing special."

The hotel staff was very attentive and very pleasant to deal with... we did the shark reef experience, it was pretty cool but nothing compared to the aqaurium at the Mall Of America in Minnesota (for those who have been there) they tied in a dinner with the shark reef so it was cheaper if you plan on eating there... the Bayside Buffet was outstanding, i have eaten the seafood buffet at the RIO before, and this one blew that one out of the water... they actually had King crab legs on the buffet!! We enjoyed everything the hotel had to offer, we went to mamma mia (the musical) it was pretty good, (coming from a football guy) my wife loved it... we enjoyed the house of blues... our room was exactly how we had seen it from the virtual tour on their website... the bathroom is HUGE!! we didnt spend a lot of time in the room but it was extremely comfy/roomy how can you go wrong when there is a tv in the bathroom! the only thing that we didnt like was the fact that the 2 starbucks didnt open until 6am (8am our time, we are early risers) and no other place in the hotel has a coffee shop unless you wanted room service for $5 a cup! On our anniversary we went to eat at Stripsteak where i had the best steak of my life... everything is a little on the pricey side but there are many other places to eat in vegas.... the tram was very easy to shuttle ourselves around to the Luxor and Excalibur for cheaper resturants and coffee! I thought that we would have to wait for a couple of minutes for the elavators (we were on the 21st floor) but there are 8 elavators for floors 2-16 and 8 other elavators for rooms 17-32or 33, it seemed like about 10-15 seconds and we would have one... very pleasant experiance!!! WE WILL BE BACK!!! P.S. STAY AWAY FROM THE LITTLE SHOP NEXT TO THE ELAVATORS... $7 FOR A BAG OF CHIPS!!! but we did buy a postcard, although they dont selll stamps, how stupid is that! we went to the business center looking for a stamp and the clerk told us not to worry about it and threw it into their outgoing mail... and yes i know its only 42 cents or whatever, but we thought that was very kind in a day and age where nothing is free anymore!! oh yeah, the pool/beach is incredible!! it was a little windy and chillly while we were there, but fun none the less!!!"

    "content": "I've stayed at Excalibur, Luxor, Flamingo, Treasure Island, and now Mandalay Bay. Mandalay Bay is by far the best of these 5. We had a 750GR suite on the 9th floor. The room was clean, crisp and comfortable. My wife thought it was a little \"dated\", but I think she was much too harsh with that comment. The king bed was so comfortable. This room was a great retreat from the busy strip. This room was also big enough to be really comfortable, but not too big that the space is wasted. The only downside to this hotel is the location. If you want to get to the other end of the strip, you're either going to walk your tail off or pay lots of money in cab fare. We took the tram from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur in order to cut off a little of the distance. You could also cut over to MGM Grand and take the monorail to the north end of the strip, but that also includes a lot of walking and the monorail isn't too cheap either. If you'll be going back and forth a lot though, it may be worth it. We paid 20 dollars(with tip) to get here from the airport on a Saturday morning. 15(with tip) to get back to the airport on a Tuesday morning. It cost 15(with tip) to get to the Bellagio by taking the freeway on a Saturday night. The casino is nice, but not really any different from any other Vegas Casino. The place has a nice smell you'll notice when you enter the building. I I didn't try out the pool, so I can't comment on that. The House of Blues was okay for breakfast, but nothing too special. Overall, I would certainly stay at this hotel again, though I'd love to try out some of the other nice places in town."

Contrary to other negative comments in some other posts: - the wait to check in was ten minutes or so - and the rooms were ready when we got there at about 1:30 pm. - the rooms were clean, spacious and didn't smell of smoke - the remote worked for both televsions and the maid service was excellent - we never had to wait more than 3 minutes for an elevator - the concierge quickly booked us reservations at the Bouchon at Venetian for the next day, no questions asked. The prices at that really high-class bistro were quite reasonable especially when compared to similar restaurants in CA, NY or London. - the shark reef/aquarium was impressive - the property was huge and the drinks at the bar very expensive but play the slots (or just sit there) and get them free for tips of a buck or two. - cabs, trams, monorails and buses were quite reasonably priced - never got to the pool beach - too much else to do The property is at the south end of the south end of the strip, but that's where all the nice casinos are. The reason we stayed there was the auction venue was there as well. All in all, a great stay."

We went straight up to a counter, no waiting and were told we had been upgraded!! We had booked a room with 2 beds months ago directly with the hotel and I kept checking the rates and called a few times and had them lowered. Well when the very polite young man asked it we would be happy with a 1500sq ft 2 bedroom suite, I think we just stood there dumbfounded and nodded our heads.He explained everything to us and gave us our keys. Off we went, walking downing the looong corridor there was our \"suite\" at the end. It was amazing 2 bedrooms, loungeroom, dining area, kids loved the electric curtains and the 5 plasma tv's. The beds were to die for, so comfortable, we had just come from the motel 6 in Williams, so it was heaven! Everything was fantastic, the pool area was fantastic, we only went in the afternoons and did not find it very crowded. We did not worry about rings for the lazy river, you did not need them. We had dinner at the buffett one night, the food was very good, in fact I think it was the best meal I ate the whole time we were in the states. It is a good walk from the foyer to the pool and you have to have your key, but in Vegas you have to walk a long way to get anywhere. I went down to the Casino to have a small flutter, it was not very busy.We went out shopping one day and did not have to wait long for the valet to get the car. When we checked out, we had 2 people in front of us, but it did not take long and our luggage was already waiting for us and they did take about 15 mins to bring the car around, must have been a busy time. All in all the Mandalay was great and even if we had not got the free upgrade I think it would still have been as enjoyable"

My wife and I went with another couple and we were both celebrating our wedding anniversaries. My travel agent called the hotel just before our arrival to let them know that. When we arrived, we were told that we were being upgraded from our standard 550DR rooms to 1050 sq. ft. suites! Our suite, complete with 4 flat screen TVs, wet bar and jacuzzi tub was located on the 60th floor with a killer view looking right up the strip. We were blown away. Everything I read about their comfortable beds was true. THE MOST comfortable bed we had ever slept in! I am guessing that due to the time of year we went, we never had problems with the crowds around the elevators or around the pool area (which was awesome). The entire hotel had some kind of aroma being piped through the ventilation that smelled very nice. Hard to describe but sort of like suntan lotion I think. The casino was very well ventilated and had a pleasant, airy feel to it that was very different than the other casinos we walked through. Had dinner twice at the buffet and lunch at House of Blues and all were very nice. Took in the \"Fantasy\" show at the Luxor next door and enjoyed it very much. The wives spent the last day at the spa while us guys gambled in the casino after check out. They held our luggage until we were ready to catch a cab for our evening flight home. I fell in love with Vegas when I visited it for the first time last year. We stayed at the Flamingo in order to be center strip, but MB was much more suited for me and my wife. We plan to go back next year and you can bet we will be staying at Mandalay Bay."

The pool is to die for with its own wave making function. Try not to bok a cabana as they are away from all the action, and we felt a waste of money. The casino is good to but has more high end gambling. We used to go to Luxor or Excalibur to gamble (US$5 tables). Service is good but slow, due to the expanse of the place. Great time in Vegas - definately recommend the hotel."

We stayed in room 13135 which is a two bedroom suite and approx 1500 sq ft and its was AWSOME! There was tons of room for my son to run around like a monkey and a livingroom area and a dinningroom area. both bedroom were spacious and so were both bathrooms. My only real complaint is that there was no mini-fridge for us to use only the mini-bar which I was warned not to touch anything unless you want to be charged for it. We had a great view of the strip and luxor. The whole hotel (including the casino) was bright and spacious. the casino wasn't very noisey or smokey (even when it was busy). Every restaurant we ate at was delicious and most of the wait staff was very helpful and polite but there was one FANTASTIC waitress in teh Red White And Blue restaurant that had us in stiches the whole time....her name escapes me now but its was our best meal, no tthat the food was exceptional but because of her. The room service was alittle pricey but it also was super tastey and very convient when you have a little one asleep and can't get out to get food. We rented a car so it was easy to get around the strip as every hotel offers free parking and vallet. This was my son's first trip and the Mandalay made it one to remeber as they accomidated every request we threw at them. I didn't get to spend much time at the pool myself but my aunt and mother seemed to love it. I would go back to Mandalay today if I didn't have to wor for a living!"

Everything was clean and comfortable. Our room was on the twenty second floor and while it did not have the best view it did have comfortable queen beds and a large bathroom with soaking tub. The restaurants were good if a little pricey. The casino and hotel lobby were so much better ventilated than so many of the other casinos which I appreciated being highly sensitive to smoke. The Luxor and Excalibur next door were horrible in terms of ventilation and smoke exposure. The other great thing about Mandalay was the free tram service from Mandalay Bay to the Luxor and Excalibur which cuts out alot of walking. If you exit at Excalibur it is only a short walk to NYNY which takes you down quite far on the strip. The one drawback I would say is that this hotel is at the south end of the strip and if you want to go to Caesars or Paris or the Mirage for shows and dinner you have quite a walk ahead of you or a pretty expensive cab ride. At peak times of heavy traffic a cab ride from Mandalay to Caesars was over $15. We did walk from the hotel down to the Bellagio and Venetian and it was quite a hike especially if you don't have the shoes for it which when you are all dressed up is a distinct possiblity."

The bed was a king bed and it was the most comfy bed and pillows too. We had a view of the moutains and side view of the strip and it was a very good view. The rest room was big, had two sinks, very large awesome tub and a seperate large shower stall. The pools/beach was great and very nice but really crowded as to be expected though. The check in for us was about 30-40 minutes but that was expected so before you go expect that. With most folks coming to town around the same time and checking into such a big resort, that is to be expected. Expect that and you'll be fine. The check in itself was nice and easy. HOuse of blues is awesome and all the food places were great too. Very nice resort. We didn't have any problems while there. The maid service kept us up on towels and kept the room nice. I will say that the door to the rooms shut loud so if you're in your room and the person in the room beside you comes into their room, it almost sounds like your door being opened. Just a loud shut type thing of a noise but not a big deal once you hear it once. We had no problem with any noise from other guests, everything was great for this trip. One thing about the Bay, it's far on the south side away from the middle of the strip. We were fine with that as we just walked to where ever we wanted to go. IF you're one to be in the middle of the action you may want a resort closer to all the action otherwise the bay is nice and quite. Oh, the Bay has a monorail that is free that runs between the Bay, Luxor, and Excalibur. Take advantage of that as well. Also in the room they have a mini bar with food and such. If you pick anything up to even look at it, it will charge your act. IF you remove anything from the mini fridge it too will charge you. Just to warn you, we didn't touch any of it. There is a Walgreens near the resort down from mgm and we went there to grab drinks and snacks and such. Very nice to have that for the in between meals. Overall the bay was very very nice, great nice large comfy rooms, Clean, great decor, Very amazing beds and pillows, Wonderful beach and pool area, and we'll be back! Our stay at the bay was Wonderful!"

    "content": "My wife and I stayed at Mandalay Bay on 9/17 and 9/18 before driving to a wedding in LA. Worst two days ever spent in a hotel! There were just so many issues we experienced in such a brief time, I had to write a review. Read below for all of the issues/problems we experienced. Day 1 -9/17 1. Long check in time (15/20 minutes) seemed rather long considering we were there at 1 pm. 2. The door to our room was hard to open, almost like the jamb was sticking. Consequently, there was no way to open or close it quietly. Not a deal breaker, but annoying. 3. The toilet in the room made continuous burping and gurgling noises for literally 10 minutes every time it was flushed. Again, something I would not expect from a seemingly 'hight end' hotel. 4. Upon arriving back at our room after an hour or so of touring the hotel, neither of our room keys would work. When I went to the desk to get the keys reset, I was told that our room (23325) was vacant and my wife had requested a new room. My wife was with me the whole time and never requested any such thing. We were both concerned that staff and the front desk would just change someone's room without checking ID. Not professional at all 3. My wife and I both found the bed in our room very uncomfortable. It was very soft and not supportive. We even removed the down mattress cover thinking that would fix the problem, but the bed was still not so great. This might just be our issue but it was annoying. 4. Our room faced south on the strip with a direct view of the airport. (Yippee) It was very loud with airport noise (both jets and the seemingly endless parade of tour helicopters. If you do stay here, get a room facing the back of the property. The view might stink, but you'll sleep better. Day 2 9/18 1. Made our way down to the much touted pool area, which was the main reason why we booked our stay at this hotel. We arrived exactly when the pool opened and were quite dismayed to see that there were cigarette butts, straws, drink stirrers and other manner of trash all over the 'beach' area where you are supposed to sit and relax. Obviously, the chairs are not removed nightly to clean and filter the sand. We found this rather disgusting and certainly not on par with a hotel of this caliber. 2. After about 25 minutes in the wave pool my wife spotted something odd floating in the water about 15 feet away. We moved a little closer to it and realized the object was a used syringe!! We had no plans of getting any closer to it so we tried to get the attention of the lifeguard. No one paid us any attention, so we ended up having to walk all the way across the pool to talk to them (By the way, there were three of them standing at the 'shore' talking). By the time they made their way over to the area where we had seen the syringe it could not be found. My wife and I never set foot back in the wave pool for the remainder of our stay. Disgusting! 3. We had to drive to LA early on Friday, so we were planning on going to bed early on Thursday. Around 9 pm we heard loud Polynesian-type music coming from the pool area. We couldn't figure out why this would be since the pool closed at 6 (which by the way, is way too early). At 9:20 my wife went down to the front desk to inquire what the music was and when it would stop. She was told it was a private party and it was scheduled to end at 9:30. At this time, my wife also listed all of the other complaints I mention here. She was greeted with a somewhat insincere 'sorry'. We were originally planning to stay at this hotel for two more nights after returning from LA, but after these first two days, we decided to cancel. When she requested to cancel the two days, the desk clerk simply replied 'ok, no problem.' She didn't seem to even care that we were canceling two nights. When my wife finally asked if they planned to do anything to compensate for this lousy experience, the desk clerk reluctantly took $50 off our total room stay. Also, the party that was making all the loud music finally ended at about 11 pm! Needless to say we didn't get much sleep on our second night either. In the 13 days we were travelling back and forth from LV to LA and back to LV, these two days were the absolute worst. We have stayed in Vegas many times and have never had such a horrible experience in such a short stay. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone based upon our experience."

Let me add that my party consisted of my boyfriend and myself, and we're both in our mid-twenties, and by no means high rollers. In the past, we've been treated differently by staff because we're young and I have an assortment of piercings and tattoos. We arrived around 3pm on Friday afternoon. After parking in the self-parking lot and walking all the way through the casino, we found that there was no line to check-in. The staff throughout our experience was courteous, polite, and inquisitive as to our stay and whether there was anything they could do to be of assistance. This included random staff passing us in the hallway to/from our room, in the bathrooms, at the blackjack tables. Anyway, after checking in, we had to wait to access our room, which was on the 30th floor, due to the maid still cleaning. We checked our bags and walked around the casino. They called my cell phone to notify me that the room was ready, most likely the minute the maid left (she was next door when we got to the 30th floor). Altogether a great check-in experience. The room was great! It was clean, beautifully styled, everything was in great shape, except for one slightly worn couch near the window (which we didn't even use). The only complaints we had were that the duvet cover/comforter had no down duvet inside it (maybe because of the time of year?), the down pillows were really small (and the bed had only three of them), the bathtub had no jets (which I believe I read in the description of the room), and the TV channels were very limited. The minibar was, as all of them are, overpriced, but the selection is quite impressive! We ordered room service our first morning, which arrived at the exact time we were told it would. It was great! We also called housekeeping and ordered the most comfy robes and slippers as well. We got a couples massage at the spa at Mandalay. (and totally well-worth it. It was probably both our favorite experience for the whole trip). Neither of us has much experience in spas, but I found it well-organized, tranquil, and well-stocked with all amenities necessary. The pool was probably our biggest letdown, as it was the main factor in deciding where we stayed. While the lazy river and wave pool were fun, none of the pools goes deeper than the 7 feet at the deep end of the wave pool, and there is nowhere to jump in. The waves did not come frequently enough. The loungechairs get crowded early, and most people stake theirs out and leave, even though signs say not to. There isn't much shade for people like myself who don't tan (just burn). Inner tubes cost $20 to rent (so we didn't). We thought that the hours of the pool were ridiculous, and for the sun-phobes like myself, I will say that I missed out on that great sunset and dusk pool time I love so much. Also, it was just ridiculously crowded. Maybe I have some issues with large crowds, but I found the pool scene during the days to be slightly stressful and chaotic in my otherwise fun, relaxing weekend. As I read in other reviews, the elevators were slow. They had 8 elevators for floors 17-34, and it still wasn't enough. Oftentimes the elevator bay would have a line out past the entrance area into the main part of the area... and the elevators would frequently skip the Casino level if they got filled on the Beach level below. Key times this would happen were when the pool area closed around 6pm, and during meal times. We learned the trick of getting on at the Casino level when elevators were going down, and then just staying on at the Beach level when it switched to go back up (and bypassed the Casino level). As for the casino, I won $50 playing penny slots (only putting $20 in), and my boyfriend, who was a beginner blackjack player, found the dealers to be friendly and helpful. I gave the hotel 4 stars because there was no option for 4 and a half. For the price-range, and considering past reviews, it was a great experience. If you want to have a full-out luxury experience, complete with turn-down service, you will probably have to go to the next price-range (for something like the Wynn). For people like me looking for a nice weekend with my significant other within our limited price-range (but still with the feel of being in a luxurious resort), this is the place."

Although they did meet our request for a strip view and adjoining rooms it was a partial strip view (but great view of the airport too) we had to wait 2/3 hours for one of the rooms to be made ready and then found that we had been charged for something missing from the mini bar which we certainly had not had - it was refunded. We stayed in large, beautifully furnished, sparkling clean deluxe rooms. The rooms had 2 Queen beds, flat screen tv, mini-bar/fridge (be wary of this - the prices are high). The bathroom had an LCD tv too, and 2 vanities, seperate shower, tub and wc. The beds were very comfortable - with those pillow top mattresses. The casino is large bright and airey - and is connected to the Luxor via 'Mandalay Place' (which is a shopping mall), and also by the monorail, which you can ride for free. The pool/beach area was great and free towels were given and no reserving of sun beds was allowed. You could only access with your room key. It has a very large wave pool, which was great, a lazy river (which you can rent tubes for), and a few other seperate pools. We did eat in the restaurants, Raffles was a great place for service breakfast but the buffet also had an amazing selection but seemed not so good quality. Dinner - the Red, White and Blue was disappointing and quite expensive for what it was but we loved the Brazilian fire pit special in the Rum Jungle. We also had a buffet dinner in the Luxor which was in an interesting setting and was great value, quality, and choice. Is at the bottom of the strip but most of it was easily within walking distance and/or a short taxi drive. We saw the Treasure Island show (the Sirens show was not what I was expecting and was a bit more adult!) and the dancing fountains at Bellagio, and looked around cearars palcae, the Venetian The staff we encountered, were all very polite, helpful and friendly, and we had a lovely time. We most certainly would stay there again. Well worth stopping at but beware the cheaper lower * hotels at your peril as they seemed to be a bit tacky from what we saw."

We booked a 750GR Suite for our honeymoon, and the room was incredible. We had an awesome view of the strip, and the best tub ever!!! My 6'5'' husband could get in that tub!!! The hotel had great restaurants, and a tram to the Luxor and Excaliber. We gambled a little bit, but not much. We tried a machine or table in every hotel!!! We walked the strip the first day and were exhausted!!! The best dinner we had was by far \"Top of the World\" in the Stratosphere. The restaurant rotates, but it takes about an hour and a half to get all the way around. It was phenomenal! Go at about 6 and you can watch the sunset over the mountains and vegas! (Make sure you are ready for the bill, the dinner cost my husband and I about $400 after tip just for the 2 of us, but it was totally worth it.) The worst dinner we had was at Aureole in Mandalay Bay. We hated the food, and noone cared! We left pissed off. The only cool thing about that restaurant is the wine list. Make sure you go and see \"O\" by Cirque De Soliel in Bellagio. It is about $350 a couple, but OMG... I would fly all the way across the country to go see it again! Of course go to the Grand Canyon... I cant really put that experience into words. It was amazing. We booked a helicopter tour over the canyon and it was breathtaking!!! Vegas is a vacation must at some point in everyones life, but it was such an amazing trip and I will go back to Mandalay Bay!"

The bathroom was clean and had everything you might need including a TV on the wall next to the sink. We had originally intended to stay at Planet Hollywood as we had done the previous year but they had no rooms left the week we were vacationing in Las Vegas. My second choice was Mandalay Bay. I am very glad that PH was booked because Mandalay Bay was far superior to PH. I am planning another trip to Las Vegas next year and will stay at Mandalay Bay again."

We had great pool views and adjoining views - the staff were very accommodating when we checked in. The wave pool and beach is loads of fun. We didn't have any problems getting sunbeds and there were 6 of us - occasionally we had to move the beds closer to on another but we had no problems with this. The restaurants and bars are great and you have a wide variety of cuisine. The formal Chinese restaurant was good value and excellent quality Chinese food. My only complaints are that the room service was a little slow and incompetent (took over 30 mins to bring a glass of milk and a spoon) and they should provide kettles in the room. We had to pay for a kettle and cups/sugar etc, and once we had paid for the whole stay the maid removed it from our room affter the first day so we had to ask for it again - eventually it was sorted out but not without some hassle. Definitely a good choice, great place to stay, at the end of the strip so you have to get cabs but it's too hot to walk anywhere anyway and it is definitely worth it to stay in such a top class hotel. I would definitely recommend the Mandalay."

It was a nice stay overall...I especially loved their SPA (not the Bathhouse) and the day pass you could get for 30 bucks or so When I visited in January 2008 my friends chose to stay at TI. My mission was to go the the MANDALAY BAY SPA again while they went to Planet Holywood ( plus I was sick and needed some eucalyptus steam room badly) to do some gambling..I had a blast as usual at the SPA. We even ended there later on at MB and caught the 40 Deuce show ( lots of fun and it was free...late Sunday night) so I liked giving them my business Now some SPAS in VEGAS are pretentious and I loved that at Mandalay Bay wasn't. Unlike some places, you didn't need to be a guest at MB and they still welcomed your business! Some hotel SPAS won't welcome you at all or only welcome you during the week.. Well sadly that has changed. This last trip I dropped my gf off at Planet H to go to one of those time-share seminar and I headed to the Bay..traffic took a bit, valeted, and went in...Now I was there 7 months ago but the SPA POLICY has NOW changed...If you are not a MB guest you must be having a SERVICE ( 90+) to use their facilities. I felt like I had wasted an afternoon, took like 20 minutes to get my car and I sadly went back and sulked at the Palazzo Pool... Now that I have stayed other places, compared to Palazzo the MBay rooms are NOTHING...now that they are snooty about their SPA I was loyal but now I will be taking by business and the gambling I would of done elsewhere...I just wished they had posted something on their website about the change..would of saved me a lot of dissapointment...at least I might of been able to book at my own hotel..."

    "content": "I came here this past weekend with a group of 6 girls for our annual girls trip. Upon arrival, there were no door men in the lobby to open the door for us. I guess that type of service has been done away with? Anyway, the lobby is clean and nicely decorated. It takes awhile to check in. I think they should have more staff on hand so that you don't have to wait 20 minutes to check into your room. While waiting in line, you get a feel for the caliber of clientele that stay at the hotel...I say 80% couples and the remaining 20% is bachelor/bachelorette parties where they are already drunk by the time they check in. The rooms look like they have been recently updated with flat panel TVs and new bed linens. When we got to our room, the bathroom hadn't been cleaned and someone left us a nice present in the toilet! When we called housekeeping they told us 30 minutes until someone could come clean it. We were pooped--excuse the pun--and decided to order room service and wait. The room service food is downright disgusting. How do you mess up a ceasar salad and quesidilla? The water filtration is pretty bad because the water had a distinct sulfer smell. Beds are super comfy though and you don't hear that much noise outside in the halls. The pool gets crowded very early and they now have a policy that everyone over the age of 14 has to be admitted to the pool area with a room key. And, they only allow one towel per person. I hate that! Raft rentals are $20 a day to float on the lazy river with 100 other people that you constantly bump into. It wouldn't be so bad if they allowed you to float with your cocktail in your hand, but you have to leave your drinks on the side of the pool and people are constantly tripping over them so I don't understand why they don't just let you bring the drink in?? Red Square has a great selection of vodka's to choose from as well as a vodka tasting room where you don a fur coat and go into 15 degree temperature controlled room and taste vodka for $100. The martini's and cocktails are great though and bartenders are really knowledgeable. Rum Jungle has great music, but they try to get $15 bucks a head to get in. I flirted with the bouncer a little and managed to walk in for free, so I guess things can be negotiated in Vegas. Overall, if you are in your early 20's, this is a fun place to hang out, but I prefer the ambiance at the Bellagio better."

The rug looked worn and dirty, a cigarette burn on the bed sheet, there was a strange film in the glasses (I opted to go buy bottled water instead), and for a non smoking room, that toilet area sure smell like my old pipe smoking uncle. I was also a bit miffed that I was never called when my room was ready (checked my bags earlier, were supposed to call). The view though was spectacular! I had a close up view of the pyramid, and could see all the way down the strip to the Wynn. Also, the bed was super comfy, and I like the choice of firm or soft pillows. Shabbiness aside, staying the night there was pleasant, and I lucked out with NO noisy neighbors."

First the good about the property: the wave pool is a blast, the beach scene is great, and there are a ton of wonderful restaurants on the property. The room I stayed in was a standard, but was tastefully decorated, had an awesome televsion, and the bathroom was terrific. As for the negatives, my biggest problem with this place is the lack of elevator capacity. I found myself waiting sometimes up to 4 minutes for an elevator, regardless of time of day. I also found it incredibly annoying that they close the pool at 6:00PM. There's a cattle call back into the hotel when the pool closes, and the wait for an elevator back up to the room is insane. I understand they want people back in the casino to gamble by 6, but why not have an outdoor casino and keep the pool open later? My only complaint about the pool area is the lack of seating (of maybe more appropriately the sheer mass of people at the beach). I also think the property should keep a maintenance staff 24/7, as opposed to what appeared to be mainly in the morning. I was up by 7AM every morning, and the common areas in the hotel were trashed with cigarette butts, cups, and trash. Granted, the hotel was cleaned later in the day, but given the nature of the location they need a bigger cleaning staff. Overall, not a bad place to stay, but other hotels may be closer to other locations on the strip."

We stayed at MB mainly for the pool & it as well as the property were clean and we had a very nice trip and might consider staying there again if anyone acted like they cared if we ever came back. They didn't so I won't . My wife loved the spa but they have one at the Venetian as well. The pool was crowded but we never had a problem getting lounge chairs.

    "content": "Had a very nice stay at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. We stayed the first week of September. The summer rush must have been over because we didn\u2019t have any problems with crowded elevators or swimming pools. Check-in was fast except I could barely hear the soft-spoken young lady that checked us in. I could hear the guy next to us though and he offered his guests a view of the pool or the strip. She didn\u2019t give us a choice and we ended up with a view of the roof of the parking garage and freeway. We have been to Vegas before so it wasn\u2019t a big problem but it was a little disappointing. The room was large and clean. We liked the nice crown molding and the fancy glasses and metal ice bucket with ice tongs. Beautiful bathroom with separate tub and shower. There was also a small TV and phone in the bathroom. Didn\u2019t like the strong vanilla odor in the room though. It got a little overpowering. I noticed at the base of the floor to ceiling windows that there is a bar you can slide that allows fresh-air ventilation in the room. We turned off the A/C at night and just let in the cool desert air and that solved the strong vanilla odor problem too. The negatives were that the door lock card didn\u2019t work very well. Always had to insert the card three or four times before it would beep. Since the door lock didn\u2019t work very well we didn\u2019t risk using the safe. The bed was very comfortable but the sheets had small rips in them. Really liked the wave pool. Big waves were knocking over the kids as well as the adults. Kids under 48\u201d aren\u2019t allowed in the wave pool. We used the lazy river without renting any tubes and nobody said anything. Floated around the river three or four times and that was enough of that. It got boring. Went back to the wave pool where there were plenty of empty lounge chairs. Shark Reef was very interesting but it got crowded and that took some of the fun out of it. Got to touch a stingray and didn\u2019t have to worry about getting stung. The guide said the stingers have been removed. Walked over to the Luxor by way of the Mandalay Place walkway and ate breakfasts and lunches at the fast food places over there to save some money. The Luxor removed the King Tut\u2019s Tomb display and they are getting ready for the Titanic exhibit. What is that thing they are building? Looks like a huge replica of the Titanic itself. Will have to check it out next year when we go back to Vegas."

Chose the hotel for it's pool complex and relative good value. We had a great corner suite - huge twin Queen bed room for the girls, big lounge and King bed room for us - perfect family room and not silly money, ask for a Strip view though, we had a view of the car park! Pools are great but crowded - we paid the big money for the rented Cabanas and got down there by 9am and left after lunch. In the desert heat the shade of the Cabanas and unlimited soft drinks were life savers but you need to book them weeks and weeks in advance. Ate in the Noodle Bar and the Red, White and Blue restaurants which were perfect for fast budget eating. Also went to the Shark Reef on the last day - not fantastic but a good way to spend an hour. Overall would recommend the hotel for families but would stay at a more upscale hotel if it was just me and the wife."

The casino is not as crowded as some of the others, which is nice. Our room was wonderful. The mattress and pillows were so comfortable it felt like I was sleeping in a cloud. The room was very clean. The bathroom was big and the massaging shower head was awesome. The bathroom had a small flat screen television, and the bedroom area had a large flat screen television. The lighting in both the bedroom and bathroom areas was poor. The casino is infused with some kind of appealing scent so that you don't have to smell the smoke that lingers in some other casinos. The pool area is also very nice - a large sand beach with a wave pool. The waves in the wave pool were a little disappointing - not very big, and not very often. The lazy river was smaller than I expected it to be - the MGM Grand lazy river is better. We also got fleeced renting intertubes - $20 per intertube rental per day! That is my only real complaint. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants except for the poolside restaurant, which was ok. The portions were decent sized and they gave us water to take to the pool with us when we were finished."

There were spots all over the carpet. A hotel of this caliber should not be having these problems keeping the place clean. Additionally, the pool area was totally chaotic. There seemed to be zero organization to any of the services (food, towels, etc.). Everything screamed \"this place is past its prime.\" On the bright side, the staff was friendly. I just wish they'd make cleanliness their top priority, because it is my (and I'm sure many other people's) top priority when staying in a hotel."

The rest of the resort was also good, including a great variety of good restaurants and things to do.

Mandalay Bay is at the south end of the strip, so most of the loud traffic and crowds stayed away."

    "content": "My husband and I were married on 8.8.08 at the Mandalay Bay Chapel. Our wedding coordinator was Angela DeCosmo who was wonderful. Every single detail was taken care of and the hotel provided us with upgrades and wonderful service. We purchased a rehersal just to make sure we knew what we were doing and our wedding coordinator and the minister went through the ceremony in 15min and we were back out enjoying the hotel. We also decided to use Jennaleighs to rent our tuxedos and because my husband already sent in the sizes and style he wanted we were in and out in 30min and the men looked wonderful. We were able to get our marriage license, tuxedos, have a rehersal, and enjoy an amazing dinner at Shanghi Lillys the night before the wedding (part of our wedding package). I would recommend getting a wedding package with the hotel because the coordinator will make all of the reservations down to breakfast in bed and all you have to do is show up at your scheduled time. The food at the hotel was expensive so we ventured out to the Luxor and Excalibur to save money but there was a great deal at the House of Blues. If you save your reciept from your first initial time you eat there you get buy one get one free breakfast (if you bring the reciept). You can keep using your reciept from breakfast too everymorning and the breakfast was very very good. The service is not as great at the house of blues and becasue it is one of the cheapiest places it is alway busy. There is a food court by the aquarium but because of the conferences going on they were packed with people all of the time. Since there is a tram connecting the Luxor and Excalibur to the Mandalay Bay it made it easy to visit the other hotels and also for our wedding guests to have other options. The wedding chapel is beautiful and probably one of the nicest ones in Vegas. It is super mondern with crystal chandeliers and modern decor. We visted other hotel's chapels and they were not as nice. My flowers turned out perfect and the photographer took amazing pictures. Warning through, they try to upcharge you so if you are wanting a lot of picture be ready to pay. We just stuck with what was included in our package. You do get to take home all of the 4x6 pictures taken the day of the wedding the next day and the rest they will send to you in a week or so. Really really fast. Our reception was held in the Media Suite and was catered by the hotel. The view from the room was of the pool and it is an amazing room to throw a party. FYI you have to have an IPOD to use for music because they do not have any other compatibility available for another device. We tried to get them to use my Dell MP3 but they could not. The cake we ordered was the best wedding cake I have ever had and everyone raved about how wonderful it was. The food was also very very good and the bartender and server were wonderful making sure we had enough to drink and eat all night. They also had the reception cleaned up in 10min so my husband and I could enjoy the suite. The next morning we had breakfast in bed which was amazing and check out was easy. The only mess up in charges they had was the breakfast in bed and they fixed it instantly so we had no issues. Just make sure you bring your itinerary and know what things are supposed to cost. The only complaint I had was that the wedding was really fast but it is Vegas and everything is fast there. If you decide to get married at the Mandalay Bay ask for Angela and make sure you email exactly what you want to her (it is best if you find a picture). I did that with my flowers and cake and they turned out exactly what I wanted. Also make sure you get one of their deluxe packages because your room rates will be reduced which saves a lot of money!"

Service staff might randomly stop you just to say hello. The hotel is spotless, and the rooms are very well appointed, comfrotable, and provide great views. The downside? Expensive ammenities, elevators, and location. This hotel is the last hotel on the strip at the north end. And staying in a complex this big has its drawback with massive crowds at the beach/pool or simply waiting for an elevator. And be careful!! If you don't have the extra $ to purchase items from the mini bar...don't even touch it. Its has electronic sensors. Go to the store in the lobby...its much more resonable! Or inner tube for the lazy river could set you back 20$ USD. Regardless... these set backs are hardly a concern and fairly common of all vegas strip hotels. This hotel competes with the best on the strip."

This hotel has it everything you could want and the rooms are a good size including large TV in the bedroom and even a TV in the bathroom. The best restaurant is the Bay Side Buffet in the lobby area all sorts of foods to choose from! Beware everything costs in this hotel you get nothing for free! The wifi is expensive probably best to avoid as it is not that reliable! All in all this hotel is great if you want something more relaxing and not in the middle of all the madness due to its location. The pools have adequate sunbeds and have something to offer everyone!"

My advice if you're going and would like to take full advantage of the pools - especially if there are a number of people in your group, buy $2.00 pool float rings (inner tube type) in advance and bring them with you. If you don't be prepared to pay $16.00 to buy and $20.00 to rent (a slightly larger sized one). Other than that, bring a lot of cash for taxis, tips and a credit card to swipe along the way; because you'll NEED it! Enjoy"

    "content": "Stayed two weekday nights in a Greatroom Suite (750GR) in Mid August 2008. I was an invited guest and checked in at 11:30 with no problem. Room: The view from the room was nice- looked at the airport and up the strip from the 33 floor. The bathroom was very nice, but the room furnishings were a tad worn, though not terribly. No problem at elevators, I was always able to get on the first one that came along while I waited. Casino: I found the dealers at the craps tables to be very professional and for the most part on the ball. I only played blackjack for 15 minutes or so and the dealer was OK. I had a single bad experience with a roulette dealer who took away a winner without paying, but I called over the pit boss who asked me what I had on the spot and paid me accordingly. I experienced very good drink service at all times. I walked up to the craps table at about 7:00 AM and wanted a coffee, I was looking behind me and the dealer asked what I wanted: I told him I was looking for drink girl. The pit boss (are they still called that?) asked me what I wanted and I said just a coffee. He picked up the phone, made a call, and I had a coffee brought directly to me shortly thereafter. Food: Noodles: Serves Pho and assorted asian dished. I had the noodle soup with duck twice it was so good $13.95. Buffet: Only had breakfast once. Good assortment, not fantastic, but acceptable. Waiter service kept my drinks filled. Raffles: Had breakfast once, the Huavos Rancheros was the best I've ever had. Again good waitress service. Jbob: This is a Sushi place in an odd spot in the casino area. I never would have known that it was there had I not stumbled up on it (note to Mandalay Staff- need some better signage). Sat at the bar and had a great meal. The menu was not all that creative and did not have any lobster dishes or flavored saki. Good service and taste sushi. RM Seafood: Sat at the bar downstairs and had shrimp cocktail (5 large shrip) and clam chowder. Bartenders were friendly and attentitive. Other stuff For the men, there is a shave shop in Mandalay Palce (retail shopping area) that gives barber shaves. It is the best $55.00 you can ever spend. Bell men- I actualy arrived at 8:00 AM Monday and knew it was too early to attempt checking in, so I left my bags with a bell man. Once I did check in I called the bell desk and my bags were delivered in well under 10 minutes. The crowd- At the games I'd guess a mix of 21-50 years old. Did not see hardly any senior citizens at all. Some families, but Mandalay Bay unlike many other places does not make people go through the casino to get to the pools. The pool level is one level below the casino so I did not really get a good feel for the number of children other than what I saw in the restaurants. I was in town during the heat of the summer, while the Olympics were happening, and midweek; my experience may not be indicative in that it can be much bussier. Note to Mandalay staff: do something about your soundtracks in the casino, remakes of Berry Manalow? Come on! I had a very good experience at Mandalay Bay and would not discourage anyone from staying there. Yes it is at one end of the strip which may be a turn off to some people. It is very easy to get to Luxor and Excaliber by rail and a quick walk from them to the Tropicana, NY NY, and MGM."

My only complaint was that the towels were clean (but a little dingy looking) & the window drapes could also use a good cleaning. The hotel location is sort of away from the rest of the main Strip hotels (Bellagio, Paris, Caesars), but there is a convenient free shuttle that goes from the Mandalay Bay to the Luxor & to the Excalibur, but if you want to visit the main hotels, get your walking shoes ready! The pool area was beautiful & there are many restaurants inside (which I didn't get an opportunity to take advantage of), but I did visit the 'House of Blues' for an evening event & it was totally awesome! If you have a chance to visit the mall that's attached to the hotel connecting to the Luxor, visit the Burger Bar - they have the best Angus Beef burgers in the world, hands down!

    "content": "Having been to Vegas a couple of times previous, I think I have a pretty descent sense of what one can expect from one of the major resort casinos on The Strip. The property itself was what you might expect from the generation of casinos (like the Mirage) that were constructed during the more 'family friendly' era of Vegas: highly thematic decor with several non-gambling entertainment options available. Our 550 square foot Deluxe Room was spacious, clean, and very comfortable. The beds were soft and made for a pleasant sleep after long nights (and days) of gambling, sightseeing, etc. We were a little surprised at how early the maids tried to makeup the room after our first night, but they soon figured out our schedule and accommodated us accordingly. Due to the fact that my wife was attending a conference, we didn't plan on gambling all that much during our stay. For the most part, we played penny/nickel slots and a little video poker (big shocker: we didn't win any money). Given that we were playing low bet games, I feared that drink service was going to be slow to nonexistent. However, for the most part, we found the wait staff friendly and responsive, especially with a modest tip. All in all, I found the casino experience at Mandalay Bay to be a good one, which was a change from my previous experiences at major casinos (which is why I tend to gamble at lower end places like Casino Royale and O'Sheas). My only gripe with Mandalay Bay was its location. Given that it's at the south end of The Strip, it's close to virtually nothing (unless you want to be near Excalibur, The Tropicana, MGM Grand, or New York New York). Most of the shows and sights we had planned to see were further north (near Caesar's) and as such we either had to take a cab or utilize the metrorail. Since Las Vegas Blvd. is nearly always at a standstill, taking a cab seemed like a waste of money, so we opted for the metrorail. However, while a more economical option, it was still a pretty descent hike from the hotel to the closest station. On balance, I think Mandalay Bay is a solid choice for anyone traveling to Vegas who won't be traveling between properties all that often or doesn't mind dropping $15 or so per cab ride. However, on our next trip, I think we'll stay further north on Las Vegas Blvd. so that we are closer to the attractions we are most interested in seeing."

The gym fee: There's a charge of $30 to use the gym for a day or $70 to use it for three days. I was traveling on business and I always work out when I travel on business. I had a heck of a time explaining this on my expense report since it shows up as a charge at the spa. For something that should be included I was totally horrified by this gauging!!!! 2. The roaches: I saw the first one late at night. I opened my closet door and the little sucker was hanging out on the inside of the door. When I opened it he came flying out past me and then crawled in the general direction of my bed. I tried to ignore it and just went to sleep. Then I saw another one in the bathroom early the next morning and decided to change rooms. 3. The overall apathy regarding roaches in my room: i went downstairs to get my room changes after the second roach siting only to be greeted by apathy. I gathered from their reaction that this is a fairly typical event at Mandalay Bay -siting roaches and changing rooms. They didn't even offer so much as an apology. DISGUSTING!!!!"

Imagine on a friday night how bad wouldn't it be... ROOM: Perfet! Great bed, TV, spetacular bathroom. Just perfect. POOL: Also great! The beach/pool is really well designed and you feel like if you were in Porto de Galinhas (Brazil) ;). I'd just suggest that the sand area could be larger because it gets crawded in the afternoon. The other thing that they could have is a little bit cultural, but, here in Brazil, everywhere you have sand (like beaches) just by the hotel entrance, we use to offer a shower and a faucet where people can remove the excess of sand from their feet and sandals. Since they didn't have one at Mandalay I had to get into the hotel and into my room leaving traces of sand all the way. Something to think about. CASINO: Large, not crowded, good service. No complains. ENTERTAINMENT: Very nice. Every night you will find a band playing at the Casino and you also have space to dance right in front of the stage. Round tables nearby. It's also cultural but there are lots of girls doing dirty dance. We don't have this kind of thing here in Brazil in places where you have families, children and elderly people. So in the beginning I found that a little strange, but I get used. ATTRACTIONS: Well, it's Vegas so take your time to take lots of pictures at night and during the day also, why not?! LOCATION: Considering I was there in august (about 100F), it's kind of hard to just walk in the strip. The hotel is a little bit far from the \"downtown\" strip. Better take the express tram to the Excalibur. Walk from here. TAXI: Well, this is a problem. Taxis are not expensive, but if don't leave a tip It seems like if you were commiting a crime! We found a few drivers that wouldn't mind, but the vast majority of them will tell you at destination: \"15 bucks plus 'propina'\". 'Propina' is the spanish word for tip. But I don't speak spanish, I speak Portuguese!!! Anyway... In general, nice opportunity to know Vegas and it's way of life."

Staying during the summer months (110 - 113 degress) with 2 teenagers, I was looking for a great pool. Great pool alright, no umbrellas or shade of any kind unless you book a cabana. The lounge chairs all needed a good scrubbing...really dirty. We had attempted to book a cabana 2 weeks prior and were told we would have to go to cabana reservations, the day we wanted it, and be put upon a waiting list. Needless to say, it was a nightmare. The \"Lord of the Cabana\" was rude, there isn't a waiting list (he decided not to do one that day) and I ended up at reservations for about 3 hours till one became available (guests who booked a cabana have till 11:00 to arrive). I spent 350.00 to get shade at 1:00 in the afternoon and the pool closes at 6. We had a 45 minute wait at all the beach area food courts. If you have a cabana, a waitress will bring you food but by the time we got one we had already eaten. We should have stayed at the Monte Carlo, cleaner pool area, shadier, and staffed properly. The valet will not bring your car around till you are downstairs at the valet area (be careful there are 2 valet areas) and that took forever. What a disappointment."

    "content": "I was disappointed and frustrated with my stay at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. I booked the stay for our first years wedding anniversary. However we experienced a number of problems none of which were put right or given attention. We appreciate that problems do occur and in most well run organisations they are put right with sincerity. It took away from what was meant to be a happy memorable time. Upon arrival the receptionist dealing with us was not friendly and did not mention our anniversary, although we saw that it was written in our booking notes. Previously having stayed at the Wynn and Bellagio for our honeymoon, we encountered nothing but friendliness from staff and we were given good wishes upon check in and upon departure from both hotels. The receptionist told us we could upgrade for a fee of $50,we duly paid this in cash. So expecting a good room, I noticed straightaway that it was not clean. Walking around the room I noticed the following; \u00b7Leftover drinks and plastic bottles on the mini bar; \u00b7Shopping bags of packaging and leftover plastic around the room; \u00b7Leftover packaging on the dining table; \u00b7Leftover dirty water and hair in the Jacuzzi/bath. Having travelled on a 11 hour flight and from the airport for a further 2-3 hours, we were both extremely tired and stressed. I was not feeling very well I had intended to take a bath to help myself feel better but couldnt as I did not feel comfortable in that room and certainly could not use an uncleaned dirty bath. I immediately called the receptionist to explain. She did not seem to understand and told me that if someone was still in the room I had to leave immediately. I did not appreciate being spoken to in such an abrupt way when the problem was not my fault, nor being ordered to leave the room for no reason. When the receptionist understood, she said she could get someone to clean the room but it could take up to two hours! I told her this was beyond unacceptable, I was then offered a room on a lower floor. I was astounded at her stupidity, I was now being asked to pick up all of my luggage again and and voluntarily downgrade. After protesting I was then offered an upgraded room on a higher floor. Upon arriving in the second room, immediately we noticed that used packaging and rubbish were lying around the room and there was a buffet with used plates and bits of fruit peel lying around. The porter called reception- the hotel could offer us another room on the top floor but with twin beds, not one bed. It did not feel like much of a luxury as the twin room beds were small. This process had wasted two hours of our time. We were given a room card for a separate elevator to the higher floors, which did not work in the separate elevator once throughout our entire stay. On a number of occasions we went into the higher floor elevators, tried to use our card and failed, making us look silly in front of other guests and wasting our time. Any time that we went to our room we had to use the Crystal Room elevator for access. It just wasted more of our time together, we had telephoned reception several times but nothing was done and we gave up. Upon checking out of the hotel, I noticed that a room upgrade charge of $87.50 had been added to each nightly stay. I was angry at this because the upgrade had been offered to us to make up for the poor service and now we were being charged for it! A total lack of organisation and communication; or perhaps more realistically the hotel thinking of ways to charge the guests more money and trying to get away with it. I had to ask for a manager to be called to remove the charge, she did not want to know and could not have been less interested. She told me an email would be sent to me for feedback. I have not yet received such email, and I believe it was just a ploy to get rid of us. The manager had the bare cheek to point out that the room we were moved to cost a lot more than our original booked room. I told her that my holiday time is worth more than any room and could that be compensated for? We could have paid for that room had we wanted to. But in Las Vegas we stayed out for the most part of the day and having a better room meant hardly anything to us as we were rarely there except to sleep. We have now sent a letter of complaint to the hotel as we never received any feedback email. I will update readers as to the outcome of this in due course as I feel I should warn potential guests what they may experience and also let readers know what the response of the hotel is."

    "content": "We had visited Mandalay Bay 3+ years ago just before we started a family. With good memories and kids in tow, we went back last month. Kiddie pool, lazy river pool, and wave pool (watch height restrictions) are always a hit for kids and Mandalay is no exception. The aquarium is a great place to visit for a couple of hours and you find some really interesting exhibits (komoto dragon, golden croc, etc.). Accomodations wise, we splurged on a suite and it is one of the nicer suites you'll find anywhere in the US (all have corner views). Ambiance wise, it is definitely one of the more family-friendly atmospheres with much less smoke around the casinos and the crowds are a touch better-behaved. However, for those who really want fully kid-friendly facilities, stay next door at the Four Seasons (no casino and whose guests are allowed to use the Mandalay facilities but not vice versa). Foodwise, the Veranda at the Four Seasons is the best and most-civilized restaurant on the Strip and their weekend brunch buffet is best-in-class (for those who value quality and quantity and for a relaxed atmosphere). One warning about ordering room service at the Mandalay - they hit you with a service charge BUT this is separate from gratuities which you must add on as well. But then again, this does help to keep away the riff raff. Net net - a great alternative for families with small kids to the tired hotels in Excalibur and Circus Circus (and for couples as well looking for more upscale at a relatively reasonable cost). As always, check the Vegas city website for convention schedules when planning a vacation."

    "content": "We stayed at the Mandalay Bay because I wanted a great pool area for my children. My husband and I have been to Vegas probably 50 times (we're from Southern Cal) and we rarely bring our children. But this was a family trip, and I had heard that the Mandalay Bay has a great pool area, so I decided to book this property. We stayed in the 2 bedroom suite at the (very far) end of the long hallway. My family of 5 and my parents all fit very nicely in the spacious 1500 sq. ft. suite. It was a long walk back and forth to the elevators though. The room was great, with a terrific view of the pool area. We had two bedrooms on each side of the suite, with a living and dining area in the middle. The TVs were huge flat screens mounted on the walls, so the hubbies were happy. The shower in my bathroom was terrific. The suite was very quiet and nice and clean. I enjoyed our room very much. My favorite feature was the automatic switch to open or close the curtains on the floor-to-ceiling windows throughout the entire suite. Housekeeping forgot about us during our stay though. In the afternoon, I had to track down a housekeeper in the hallway and ask her to clean our room. Overall, the staff at the hotel were friendly and efficient, but strangely housekeeping was neither. We didn't even have facecloths in our bathrooms when we arrived in our room. Now to the pool area. It is CROWDED! We went down Friday for an hour before it closed (it closes at 7:00 pm). It was a mess and you can tell it is a total party atmosphere with druken college-aged kids (hey-it IS Vegas afterall). But the next morning, we were there right when the pool opened (8:00 am) and got some chairs near the lazy river. My kids loved it. My little one, who is 3, floated with me for hours around the lazy river in her llittle tube. My older 2 kids went to wave pool. It was wonderful. This is Vegas, so you expect a party atmosphere, but there were also a lot of families at the pool. It was a mix of people. It seemed quieter at the lazy river though, which suited us nicely. On Sunday, we went to the brunch buffet at the Mandalay against my wishes. It was almost $100 for a family of 5 and very disappointing (except the cookies-which were delicious!). I have been to a lot of Vegas buffets and this one wasn't exceptional. Vegas is no longer the bargain it once was, and the Mandalay Bay is no exception. For my husband and I to each have a cocktail, it was almost $30 (for 2 drinks!). But you're going to pay those prices at any of the nice hotels these days. Overall, the Mandalay Bay is a nice place to stay. The pool area is the best I have ever seen in Vegas, like a mini waterpark. If you want to keep the kids entertained, the pool area is the place to do it. But get there early and stake your claim on some chairs. If you don't bring the kids, then the pool area is still a great place to hang out all day, just expect a lot of company! There is also the mini aquarium, the Shark Reef at the property. My parents took the kids there Saturday night while my husband and I went to a concert at another hotel. Basically, we arrived at the Mandalay Bay and never left the property other than to go to the concert. It has everything you need, except a food court. And the restaurants are kind of pricey! I still think that Vegas isn't really a family destination, despite the trend toward that over the past decade. But if you do want to bring the kids, there is enough to keep them entertained at the Mandalay Bay. My overall impression of the Mandalay Bay is that it s a nice, massive property in Vegas. But there are a lot of nice, massive properties in Vegas. The only thing that gives the Mandalay Bay a real edge is the pool area."

I booked through the hotel website and received a pretty good deal (reduced rate, casino and restaurant coupons, etc.). The room was fantastic - comfy bed, beautiful bathroom. Maid service was always prompt and the staff is very friendly. The restaurants in the resort offer adequate types of food to appeal to every taste. I'm not a \"foodie\" so I stuck to more basic fare. My meals were good, but pricey (everything is expensive in Vegas). Likewise, the drinks at the pool cost a small fortune and I found them to be very weak (if I'm going to pay $12 for a drink, I expect a little alcohol in it!) The temps were in the 110s so I only spent a few hours at the pool each day. Expect Mandalay Beach to be crowded - chaise lounges are barely 12 inches apart. Beware - the sand gets hot so keep your sandals on when you're walking around. I prefered the secondary pool located closer to the convention center because it was less crowded. Some people may find MB too far away from the center of the strip for their taste. Remember that there are free monorails. You can go from MB to Excaliber, walk across the street to MGM and take another tram which will take you down the strip. I enjoyed walking through the other hotels and casinos - you'll see everything from the truly tacky to the wonderfully tasteful. I would definitely recommend Mandalay Bay but have two pieces of advice for travelers: 1) try to avoid July and August - it's HHHOT! and 2) be prepared to spend more money than you planned on meals and drinks."

We had not booked in advance as we did not know when we were going to arrive back in Vegas after 3 weeks fly/drive,we tried the Luxor, but after waiting in line for over 1/2 hr we reached the front desk only to be told \"No rooms\" (it was a Saturday!) but the lovely young lady gave me use of her computer to check the internet for availabilty and I picked the Mandalay as we prefer that end of the strip. We moved the car to the Mandalay self park and actually used the check in at The Hotel, closer and less crowded, the lady checked us in, upgraded our room(no charge)and was a delight. The room was first class and had everything you would expect from a 4* casino hotel. Housekeeping did a great job spotless every day. No problems with the room at all during our stay. The restaurants are really first class, (but avoid Red, White & Blue, overpriced average food) We ate at Red Square, great martini's, super food and top class service. Fleur de Lys was a wonderful meal, great wine but not cheap, but hey we were on holiday. The Burger Bar was great fun with a huge range of beers on offer from all over the world, and the best Buffallo burger I have had. Our only complaint would be the lack of cocktails offered whilst we were playing the slots, in 3 days we only asked once! We quite often moved to the Luxor to play as there the cocktails were both plentiful and the waitresses very friendly. Overall my wife and I enjoyed the Mandalay and would return here any time we visit Vegas, but probably play the slots elsewhwere."

The room was a nice size with lots of closet space and the beds were really comfortable. Razzles Cafe had good food for a decent price and the staff was friendly. Check-out was really fast and the staff was very helpful. Now the bad: Housekeeping was hit or miss and we had to ask for towels. There were no coffee makers in the room and no express room service so I had to either trek to Starbucks every morning or wait 45 minutes to an hour for coffee. Starbucks personnel was very unfriendly and not at all helpful. They did not put the sleeves on the cups which meant you burned your hand trying to do it after the coffee had been poured. We tried to eat at a few other restaurants in the Hotel but the staff was so unfriendly we just turned around and left. All in all Mandalay Bay is a really nice hotel, so it is a real shame that their customer service is so hit or miss."

On second day we noticed that our door did not latch...locked, but you could push it right open. None too happy about that; had left our belongings and slept in an unlocked room. Called the front desk to complain. Initial l response was they would send someone up. Told her that I wasn't going to waste my day waiting for repairs. Spoke to a supervisor who sent us to a suite a couple floors up. Didn't even have to visit the front desk. Obviously the suite was even nicer, and the locks worked! Overall, very satisfied with the way MB handled the problem. Pool area lives up to its reputation. Very large, lots of options, and quite crowed. Arrived around noon (on a Monday) and was able to find two chairs together. Elevator wait didn't seem much longer than it is at any other hotel. Location is off the beaten path, but after spending some time at Mirage and TI, I came to appreciate it. The casino is never that busy."

I was very happy with the room, as it was very spacious, clean and well designed. I also have to mention the cleaning staff, they were above and beyond good. The people who cleaned our room even organized the bathroom and put my shaving blade and toothbrush on a clean little towel when it was previously sitting on the counter. They even threw out some of the trash that we had laying around. The main reason we wanted to stay at was the pool and it didn't disappoint. Unfortunately the weather did not play along as it was rainy and cloudy but that didn't diminish the coolness of the pool. I loved the wave pool, lazy river and multitude of other smaller pools. I also have to give props to the lifeguards. The guards were spread throughout the pool area but not in an obtrusive way. The day we were at the pool there was an incident with a disabled guy in an area of the pool that was off -limits and the lifeguards did an amazing job of resolving it. Mandalay is pretty dang expensive and unless you are trying to impress someone, there are more cost-effective places to stay. I will say that it was well worth the money."

There is also a lazy river and beachside restaurants and a beachside casino. We would have stayed out there all day if it hadn't gotten to 110 degrees in the afternoon. Casino/restaurants are nice (avoid red/white/blue...not good). We had a great lunch at the burger bar in the shopping area, and a great dinner at Lupo. We have stayed at luxor, ny ny, cesars, and planet hollywood (when it was aladdin) and this is by far our favorite...perfect for the not too young/not too old crowd."

Although, we paid for four star hotel there was no perks of staying at four star. We didn't get the room we booked, we didn't get the breakfast we ordered, front desk was very unfriendly and didn't know how to get wireless access working. They promised us 13.99 per day but charged us double. Front desk offered late check out initially but on the actual day said no. The bouncer for the roof top party was giving us a hard time and attitude. Well, I think the service could be much better."

    "content": "We had great expectations from this hotel but sadly, we were so disappointed. The only good thing that came out from our stay is that our kids had a blast at their pool area (wave pool and lazy river) eventhough they ran out of towels 2 days out of the 4 days that we were there. So we checked in and it was a breeze. We were given a room on the 18th floor. As soon as we got to the room there was a strong smell of smoke. So my husband called the front desk just to verify that we were given a non-smoking room as requested and they said that the whole floor was non-smoking. They were sold out the first night that we were there so they couldn't move us but they were going to send someone with air freshner. They never came, twice we checked the status of our air freshners and twice they told us that they were coming and they never came. We later figured out that cigarette smoke was coming from next door so we ended up putting a wet towel under the connecting door to stop the smoke from coming into our room. So this tells me that this hotel doesn't really enforce the no smoking policy that they have in the rooms. The room itself was not really impressive. The table was dusty, the carpet was not really clean and everything that we open creaks. The door to both closets, the door to the bathroom, the door to the toilet they all make these creaky sounds. There was a tv in the bathroom but the remote control was not working - so it was useless. We don't know if they were having problems with the elevators when we were there because they were really SLOW. And the ones that would stop on the way down are always full. So what we ended up doing was catching the elevator that was going up to get down to either the casino level or the beach level - complete waste of our time!!! The thing that really got to me was housekeeping. The entire time of our stay at this hotel we had to call housekeeping to remind them to clean our room. Mind you we were out of the room most of the day because we were lounging by the pool and yet we go back to the room and it wasn't cleaned. So for 3 nights in a row we had to call housekeeping to get our room cleaned on our way out to dinner. The first two nights that we called them we came back to the room and it was cleaned. But on our last night, I had to call them a total of 4 times that day for them to clean our room and still they didn't clean it. On this last night, I called them at 10:15 to complain about this incident and they said that they cleaned the room next to us and not ours by mistake. The also said that they can have someone in our room in about 15 minutes to clean. Are you kidding me?!?!?! Clean my room at 10:30 that night? Wake up my kids so that they can clean my room now and not earlier when they should've done it?!?!?! I've had it with this place - I just politely said that everyone's tired and that we would appreciate it if they can provide us with some clean towels and remove the dirty ones. I'm pretty sure this will be our first and last time staying here!"

I had a 40 inch tv and a 15 inch one in the bathroom. The carpet, bed, furniture, closet, standing shower, and tub are things you would purchase for your house if you wanted to spend some extra money on your room. The bed is one of the BEST beds I have ever slept in, it makes me want to sleep and not gamble. Cons: There is a open bar inside the room which is completely to high priced and if you want to stop drinking it will help you do so. The tub is so relaxing and with hot water is even better, but for some reason nothing was given to add to the water...? And the parking structure is outdated. Clearly the pros out weigh the cons, it is the perfect spot for coules, it is to high priced to go with the guys."

    "content": "Planning a getaway with friends, found the SPF specials for Mandalay Bay Hotel online. For $129/night, mid-week, we also received 2 for 1 breakfast coupons for House of Blues (in the Casino) and $20 retail credits in pool area stores, for each of the rooms. In my judgment, the room was not luxurious in decor, but that was preferable to super Vegas-y over-the-top. It was very spacious, comfortable and clean. The bathroom was GREAT - designed to appear like a spa, large space with a huge bathtub and separate shower. (Weird that the shower had no place to rest a foot while washing or shaving, and no handle for balance. Poor functional design, but it looked good.) Staying at the hotel Tues-Thurs night was much better than being there over a weekend to my taste. It started to get too crowded with low-life types moving in Thurs night/Fri morning (headed up the elevators with suitcases and cases of beer? Tacky.) We were glad to be leaving. We did find that the end-of-Strip location of this hotel was, for us, a bonus. There is less foot traffic and fewer people from the outside just wandering around, and seemed somewhat more upscale guests (again, before the weekend.) Lots of families during the week, with constant traffic in the elevators of little kids with floats for the pool and river. I echo the reports of others about unpredictable and unreasonably long waits for elevators (we were on the 26th of about 34 floors.) Too hot (112 degrees) for me in July to go sit outside and enjoy the pool scene but would have liked to watch the Friday night movies (while IN the pool!) if we'd stayed that long. Pools are amazing. The spa pass is a bargain at $20/day. The dinner buffet at the restaurant in the hotel was excellent, seemed very clean and fresh and carefully attended. The food choices were more attractive to us than other buffets in LV. Very nice staff - in fact when my taxi dropped me off at the wrong entrance, the desk clerk for The Hotel at Mandalay Bay was kind enough to allow me to check in there, rather than requiring me to travel the length of the casino with my suitcase to find the main check-in area and stand in line for Mandalay Bay registration desk. I would definitely go back to this hotel but only for a mid-week stay."

Arrived at the hotel at about 10:30pm to wait in a long line to find out our room was not available (apparently due to over-booking). Was offered a King Suite in THE Hotel but was not a non-smoking room and no beds for our 2 kids. The clerk stated that people who stay at THE Hotel don't smoke in the smoking rooms - what a crock! The room wreaked of cigarette smoke. They offered a roll-away bed and linens for the couch. We accepted since it was 2am our east coast time and we were all fading quickly. Took an hour for the roll away and linens to arrive and no pillows. We were told pillows would follow within the hour but never arrived. Kids were so sleepy that the lack of pillows didn't seem to bother them. I was able to change rooms to a non-smoking King Suite with a pull out sofa in THE Hotel the next day which was very nice but inconvenient to have to move to a new room in the middle of the day. Other than the upgrade King Suites from the standard 2 Queen room I had originally booked no compensation was offered even though I did ask what they could do for me considering the gross inconvenience to my family. The pools (which is why we chose Mandalay Bay) are awesome - a little crowded in the late morning so get there early to avoid the crowds and mid-day heat. Kids loved the wave pool. The V- variety show at Planet Hollywood was fantastic as was the food and entertainment at the Hofbrauhaus Restaurant."

The pool area is very large and elaborate, but beyond that the hotel lacks. The idea of customer service is non-existent. Checked in at 10:30 pm and found multiple long lines. It was like a grocery store check-out. After 20 minutes got to the counter and was told all they had available were smoking rooms, despite the fact that I had booked and pre-paid for a non-smoking room. I asked to speak to the manager and the individual refused to come out. The counter clerk went to the back and then had to come out to once again relay that there was nothing but smoking. I again asked the manager to come out from the back room to discuss the situation or I would be expecting my money back and leave the hotel. Once again the clerk returned by herself and this time the unseen manager had amazingly found a non-smoking room. Got to the room about 11 pm and there were two rooms of kids running the halls screaming. Called security after 15 minutes when it did not stop. At 11:45 security callled me to ask if I had called them (the kids running the halls was still going on)???? Gee...kind of glad I hadn't called about something more serious! Other issues throughout the week: * Each day I called for turndown service and recieved it only on the last night. * Had to call maintenance twice about a bathroom door issue before someone came to fix it. * Pool towels were extremely worn out and stained. * I was reprimanded by a 16 year old towel attendant when I inadvertently took 2 towels for use at the pool. * Went to the pool one day at 4 pm and found plastic cups, straws, papers, cigarette butts and various other trash lying about. I cleaned a chair and table off myself and sat there until the pool closed at 7 pm. At no time during those 3 hours did any employee walk through to clean up trash. It was all still lying there when I left. * Went to a bar and when approached by the bartender they just looked at me and said \"yeah?\". No hello, no smile, no anything. FYI...the beds are made up of feather pillows and duvet. I did not know this when we checked in and the next morning had to request housekeeping to swap all this out for hypoallergenic. To their credit they were very accommodating. I am an executive myself at a Fortune 500 company. I point all the issues I saw at the Mandalay down to very, very poor management. This hotel needs a serious corporate shakedown. I will never stay here again."

    "date": "July 20, 2008",
    "content": "I had a great experience traveling to Vegas with 12 friends to celebrate my 40th birthday at the MB Wave Pool. 3 groups of us stayed at Mandalay Bay from July 5th - 8th, and others in my party stayed at MGM Grand, Ballys and Paris. This was my 4th trip to Vegas for various reasons from biz to pleasure, so kind of new what to expect. I seesawed between MGM Grand Pool and the MB Pool based upon reviews and others website I read. Decided upon MB after reading there less kids at the MB pool and MB pool area also has a lazy river with tube rentals. MGM Grand pool would only allow cabana rentals 7 days in advance but could book MB bungalows/cabanas 30 days in advance and are larger in size which made it much easier to plan for my group. I booked through the MB website direct under a Summer promotion (SPF 159) for a 550DDR room king bed, non-smoking with a strip view and that's what y wife and I received. The promo also gave VIP access to Moorea Beach (topless area), early access to pool area, the MB spa, and no-cover charge access to Mix on the top floor plus other perks. My wife and her girlfriends had drinks at Mix and had a good time - you should go up jsut for the view alone. Pros: -I loved the room ( we were in Rom #31229), especially the view. -Comfortable beds and lots of pillows wih excellent quality of sheets. -Excellent service all around from the MB staff for a busy weekend including the pool staff, restaurants, casino dealers, cigar shop, c-store, Mix club, checkin, housekeeping and checkout staff. -Checkin was breeze after a 20 minute wait - efficient service. Be sure to check you receive your promo coupons or return travel vouchers upon checkin at some point. -Room was very nice including the super large bathroom with whirlpool tub for two, separate shower, and separate toilet room. -Loved the stone tile floor in the shower - nice touch. -Nice having a HDTV in the bathroom while getting ready. -We booked a beach bungalow 3 weeks in advance for spending my birthday at the MB wave pool area - do it. It was worth money for the dedicated staff for drink and food service and the shade. -Pricing for food and drinks were same as what others would stand inline for so that was plus being able to order from menus. -We had drinks & dinner at the MB restaurant China Grill - excellent Asian and Thai food. Excellent bar and staff service. I would go back to MB to eat there alone. -Strongly recommend booking a cabana (seats 4-6) or bungalow (seats 6 - 8) if you are there with a group for the seating, your own wait staff and shade. It was a great experience 0 many thanks to Jason, Michelle, Leslie and Jaime. Be sure to tip them since it was 114 degrees and they keep our mini-kegs stocked with ice and our bungalow fridge stocked all day with water and sodas. -Checkout was breeze with only a few people waiting in line when I checked out on 7/8 at 11am. -I was able to get late checkout extended by 2 hours to 1pm but be sure to ask at checkin or call one day before your scheduled departure date and call early afternoon. -There is a private monorail that runs from the MB only to Excalibur and a separate one that runs only to Luxor which is very convenient. You can also walk through a connect tunnel from MB to Luxor. -Good table service for drinks while gambling - we took an entire BJ table and had drinks coming continually. -Very easy to get a taxi - very short lines the entire time we were there. -There is a Davidoff cigar sho right next to the casino tables whihc was nice. I like a good one once or twice a year. -Bikini bar at MB pool had great drinks - be sure to try the Miami Vice )strawberry daiquiri/pina combo with a 151 floater or order from your cabana wait staff. They had great frozen drinks. Cons: -We could not win at slots or table games at MB. Very tight slots and lowest table we could find was $15 tables so ended up at MGM. -We had free access to the Moorea topless pool area and it would not be worth the $40 access fee (for MB guests in IMHO) for access up there unless you to get away from the kids at the main pools. If you have comp-ed access, go up and have a drink at the bar. -MB pool casino was closed on the Monday 7/7 we were at the pool. Elevators are divided into two groups: floors 17 - 34 and 2-16. The wait was too long as confused people discovered they were in the wrong area based on their room floor. My tip- just get on one whether its going up or down. -Mix club -- you must wear long pants and closed toe shoes. It was 114 degrees which makes it tough. -Checkout bill was incorrect - be sure to check you bill in that if you are due credits related to any room promo, that you get it. -Expensive - most everything costs much higher than any other casinos. I knew that going in but be aware. -Getting a room upgrade to a suite was impossble after calling and requesting it at checkin. I asked but was denied due to all suites being reserved. TIPS: -Our room nuber was 31229. Room numbers are 4 -5 digits in length. The first or first two #\u2019s are your floor number and the last three digits are your room number. ODD numbered rooms 201 \u2013 233 are strip view room numbers and even 200 \u2013 232 are pool view. Any floor 20 or higher are considered premium rooms. Keep this in mind. -If you book a pool cabana or bungalow, call 2 days before to confirm. MB had made an error in my type of pool cabana when I called (thankfully I called) which they corrected. Get to the pool area early, many shaded places fill quickly especially if want shade or did not book a private area. Also it is ust if have guests staying at other hotels. They do allow non-MB people to visit the pool IF you have private cabana booked. -They provide beach towels upon entering the pool area - be sure to pick up one. -They have computer in the business services area for flight checkin and boarding pass printing. It is only open during business hours - 8am to 6pm and located to the left of the checkin area. -Have breakfast at House of Blues - someone in my party recommended it. -Do not rent a car; take a cab, walk or ride the monorails including the LV monorail or the private one that runs from MB to Excalibur or Luxor. All in all I will stay there again. It was a really nice hotel. our room was great and casino with excellent service and staff. The pool area was crowded but we had a blast."

All had dirty carpets, linen, one broken front door. Rooms stank, either of sewage/pee or smoke. Pool staff are young locals and dont care about customer service. Towels run out if you come to the pool at 5pm. Not to mention most are dirty and stained anyways (disjusting and I wonder why health services let them get away with the filth). Pool area could be great if not filled with mostly degenerate looking types. But so would the rest of Vegas. No offense to those resembling these remarks. Not enough elevators, lift lines extend into lobby at rush hour, which is most of the time you want to use them. Too bad, great looking hotel and it could, with proper management, be great all around. Sorry though I won't risk it again. Some nice staff at the hotel too, again all let down by incompetent management."

    "content": "My wife and I just returned from a quick two night stay at Mandalay Bay. After reading the various reviews on this site, I had concerns about the service and other issues that were mentioned prior to arrival. Before I confirm or deny some of those recurring themes, let me state that our visit occurred mid-week , 7/8-10. Nightmares at check-in: Not at all\u2026three to five minutes in line at most. Check in was very swift. Also note that we had requested a non-smoking king room (three months prior) and were assigned to a smoking room. No odor in the room, (so I was going to \u201clet it go\u201d) BUT the other smoking patrons on the floor refused to abide to the \u201cNo Smoking in the Corridors\u201d policy, thus, smoke became rather pungent in the room overnight. The guests on that floor were also VERY loud in the halls as well. I notified the front desk of the booking issue the next morning and we were efficiently transferred to an identical, non-smoking room on a lower floor. Slow elevators: NEVER had a problem\u2026Never a wait Crowded pool: I\u2019ll preface by saying that the day we selected to use the pool, the temperature was a hot 112. Busy by the wave pool and lazy river, but not an issue finding two lounge chairs. Bargains?: None. Food, drinks and attractions are pricey. Your best \u201cbet\u201d for all the rest of the traditional Vegas fun is to take a cab downtown to Fremont Street. (round-trip from the MB to the Union Plaza via I-15 is about $60.00) We had the BEST time. Had two DELICIOUS prime rib dinners and drinks at the 4 Queens. Outstanding gaming there as well. (\u201cJoe\u201d was our Blackjack dealer\u2026it was like he invited us into his own house..Very cool and non-intimidating) Casino at MB was eerily quiet. Not friendly. $15.oo dollar minimum bet at the tables. Did not want to donate anymore money to MGM/Mirage. To summarize, you can enjoy the MB and it\u2019s nice d\u00e9cor, (it really is beautiful) but for anything other than lounging by the pool and sleeping, head north to Fremont Street."

    "content": "I have stayed at Mandalay many times over the past years, and I booked the property with the anticipation that my experience would mirror my past experiences. Check in: Check in was a mess. It took me 45 minutes to valet my car (other parking, while available was poorly marked) and once I got into the check in line, it was another 45 minutes. In fact, the check in line looked like a scene from the early 1900's Ellis Island. Families, squalling brats, kids running around, people arguing with the check in personnel, credit card failures holding up the line...well, you have a good idea of the scene. Getting to the room: Mandalay has an elevator problem. There is not enough elevators. One person (with whom I had been waiting 10 or so minutes with) told me that Mandalay has the lowest elevator to guest ratio on the strip. Now this information is heresay, but I believe it. Room: The room was still up to the old Mandalay standards. Neat, clean, great view, well serviced. However, there are no security locks on the door. The door locks, of course, but the maid walked into our room on two occasions (we failed to put the privacy please notice on the door). So, we went to the pool. The main pool (and I think the thing that is drawing all the kids) has a wave pool and a sand beach. The pool was dirty (straws, cups, french fries, band-aids were a few of the items I noticed in the water), and very, very, crowded. Ok, enough of that...There is an adult pool, so we went to give that a try. We walked up to the adult pool, and we were told it was a $50 dollar admission for me, and $10 for my wife. I then learned adult meant topless (optional), and I guess they figured I would pay for that (I did not). That was my last trip to the pool. So, here is the skinny. Mandalay is changing from a nice adult casino to a family oriented resort. Unfortunately, from my point of view, they are not equipped to do this, and a hotel cannot be all things to all people. If you plan on a family vacation and have kids, you might enjoy this (after all, you are travelling with kids), however if you are a couple, or a single....I would not stay at Mandalay."

The hotel room was gorgeous we got 2 queen beds which they wer very confy,the bathroom was lovely too, we had two sinks,a good shower,a large bath tub which was great for 2 people and there was also a t.v in the bathroom too.the toilet has a very good flush too and the cleaners were brilliant the room always looked lovely. a good tip is fill your ice bucket up and tip it into the sink to put your drinks in as it keeps your drinks cooler for longer. we had quite a good view,the airport was infront of us then the strip on the left. the only thing about the hotel which we didnt like, was the location as it was the last hotel on the strip, so it took us at least 30mins just to walk to newyork newyork casino.but they also do a monorail which was brilliant as it only takes 2minutes. the checkout was fine,very quick."

    "content": "Stayed here for two nights at the end of June. Being a Sunday and Monday night, the rate was really good at $99 a night. I wanted to take the kids to the highly touted pool for a day since it was very hot in Vegas. First, when we arrived at the valet, it was just a zoo. Cars and taxis all over the place. It was about 2 pm so probably not the best time there. Not a problem getting the bell guys to take the bags. Check in was another story. It took about an hour to finally check in, which is painful when you have two kids with you! The check in girl was friendly enough, just really slow. I was impressed with the room, a strip view on floor 21. Roomy and clean with very comfortable beds. Only slight problem was the previous guest had been smoking in it, even though it was non-smoking. They even put cellophane over the smoke alarm. What I can say about the pool is that you'd better get there when it opens to find a good place to sit. By 10 a.m. it is slim pickins. Only 1 towel per guest, and they are strict about that. It is beautiful and the kids really enjoyed the wave pool and lazy river, but just crammed full of people. Not a very relaxing type pool. We ended up securing a cabana for $250, which was worth it to us, with the kids and all. We had put our name on a waiting list for cancellations and were lucky to get one. Very nice with a couch, soft drinks, flat screen, and fresh towels. Great service also. Overall, this place was okay. It is just so huge. I'd probably stay here again, but only with a great rate."

Just be prepared to spend a lot of money...nothing of value in Vegas is reasonably priced. Example: Lunch - 2 sandwiches/2 sodas - with tip $48 at one of the restaurants in the hotel. If you want to try something different, have a drink at Red Square. The bar is an ice bar and the drinks are great. And, the room itself is very cool. The hotel has a beach which we checked out. It was crowded and the people looked like they were have a fun time. I highly recommend this hotel."

I gave the hotel a very poor rating, and followed up with a letter of complaint. It has been three months now, and I have yet to hear from anyone. Poor service just seems to be business as usual there, will spend my money elsewhere next time I visit Vegas."

We had adjoining rooms and strip views which I requested when we booked it. The hotel is very clean and well run, My only negative is the pool area, there's no umbrellas or proper beds, the pool area makes the hotel feel cheap. you've got really worn out towels, no padding for the beds, just plastic, you can only be in the shade if you book a cabana which have to be booked in advance and are quite expensive. On one of the days we booked the pool club area upstairs which was much nicer. Also the music is outragously bad around the pool. It's either heavy hip hop or bad american rock music. It really let the whole place down in my eyes. Apart from that it's good."

    "content": "I have visited the Mandalay Bay casino area before and was impressed by the rooms as well. Upon first arrival I was a little disappointed. Apparently everyone decided to check in at 11am and the lines were very long. They only had 3-4 windows open and once some men complained to staffers that they had been waiting 1 hour to check-in they immediately called in extra staff. It took about 45 min to check in, but I immediately got into my room so that made up for it. The rooms was over the top awesome. Very large, with two closets. A great view of the strip and a very large TV, probably 45 in, flat screen. The bathroom was great. Another flat screen, not as large though. A seperate jacuzzi tub and a double vantity. The room was so nice and spacious that it would probably have been a suite at a place down the road. The bed was so comfortable and the sheets were some of the softest I've ever slept on period, much less at a hotel. I could complain that the a/c didn't work the best....but that could be because it was 110 degrees outside. I could complain that the maid service didn't come one day....but it was probably because we had people in and out of the room all day and they never knew when to come and clean. See people... it's all relative. I was there for a conference so let me speak on that subject as well. The convention center is a good 1 to 1.5 miles away from the rooms. No kidding and yes all was still inside the hotel. Women listen to me...take walking shoes.. you will need them! Pool area was nice. Only got to spend a little time there. I was disappointed that you can not sit or stand on the wave pool \"beach\" area. You have to get fully in the water or get completely out. Staff was very nice. I had lunch at the House of Blues bar twice and the two bartenders were so kind and took great care of all the customers. The casino was nice, drinks good, no smoke haze and they played really good music. Everyone at the blackjack table was singing along to the 'radio\". The dealers were very kind to me since I got to take money home. This is my fourth trip to Vegas and this hotel would be my first choice upon return. I said that about the Paris hotel last year, but Ireally don't think it compares to the Mandalay Bay."

    "content": "This was my third stay here but the first time I brought my wife and 12 yr old daughter. Check-in is always entertaining at this property. The girl I had at check-in was \"quick\" and patronizing. The man in front of me asked for a king sized bed but he was told all they had were 2 queens and then she said, \"elevators to your right.\" I explained to her that it was my wife and daughter's first time in Vegas and asked for a higher floor and she told me they only have king beds available on the higher floors, \"elevators to your right.\" On a previous visit here, I was told tthey were out of pool view rooms. I slipped a $20.00 bill across to the check-in girl and asked if she had any now. I got the room I wanted! People in Vegas treat money like a second language. The hotel is beautiful with a South Seas/Tropical theme. It is a huge property with lots of open space in the lobby areas. Unlike other vegas hotels, you do not have to walk through the annoying casino to find an elevator to your room. That is very nice after arriving from a long flight. The wave pool and sandy beach, lazy river ride and outdoor restaurants are a big hit with families. The pool area is very large and tropically landscaped. There is a topless pool for the ladies who want ot go topless located in a separate, much removed area. The rooms are large and well decorated. Please stay away from the mini bar unless you really want something from it. The mini bar is equipped with sensors so the moment you remove something, you are charged for it! Our room had a poor view of the pool area, thanks to the rude check-in girl. We had breakfast one morning at the Orchid Bar which doubles as a Starbucks in the morning. Please expect to pay about 25% more than a normal Starbucks. We ate another morning at the Red white and Blue restaurant which is more like a diner. The food was good and priced fairly for the portion sizes we got. We ate dinner one night at Wolgang Puck's Lupos. This place is a ripoff. The food is very overpriced and the quality is average. There is a free tram that takes you to the Excalibur Hotel and from there it is a quick walk to the strip. There is also \"Mandalay Place\" a mall/walkway that connects to the Luxor. There is a fabulous burger restaurant just before you get ot the Luxor on your left. Good prices and fantastic food. Overall, the staff was family friendly and my daughter had a blast here. The purpose of the trip was a trade show for me and the family played while I worked."

I am probably not a good judge of casino gaming but Mandalay Bay seemed okay. It never was as crowded as the other casinos I visited. Maybe the location at the South End of the Strip is responsible for this. Great restaurants, though pricey. Mandalay Bay has many restaurants of famous name that you will find in other cities in the US. Nice shopping with Mandalay Place between the resort and the Luxor Resort. A monorail connects the M. Bay with The Excalibur. Convention Complex is huge! Takes about thirty minutes just to get there from the hotel rooms. Elevators were slow and crowded. I would return."

    "content": "We booked the Mandalay Bay for four nights initially and arrived expecting it to be amazing. First of all there was AN HOUR queue for check-in. It was memorial day weekend - but that's not my problem - they need to sort it out. Foyer was amazing and when we finally got up there room was beautiful. However we had paid for a strip view and if you put your face flat against the glass at the far end of the room you could just about see the strip. I complained to the front desk and they agreed to move us the next day as soon as another room was available. The room was gorgeous with a stunning bathroom, really nice and large. There is a great selection of restaurants - probably the best of all the hotels and the casino is among the nicest. By the time we'd settled into our rooms it was about 5.30 at night and we decided as it was still in the mid-20s to go down and have a look at the pool or 'beach' - this was where it all went wrong. Bearing in mind they were offering a south seas style paradise there is no other way to describe it than 18-30s Benidorm-style hell. Yes there was lovely pools and fake palm trees, but I would guess 500 sunbeds crammed so close together you could touch your next door neighbour and the person laying next to them. There was loud music, cigarette butts in the sand and everyone seemed drunk. We had in fact come to Vegas a day early after bad weather down the east coast and one of the main things we wanted to do was chill out in the sun - there was no way you could relax here. So we moved hotels. Also a note to parents - I wouldn't like to try and keep an eye on a small child here, its far too busy. To be fair the hotel were excellent and only charged us for the night we stayed. I realise you don't come to Vegas to relax but if you want to lay beside a relaxing pool in the day - the Mandalay isn't for you. If you want a pool party with a 200 other people you'd probably love it. If you're not going near the pool but want a gorgeous hotel, it's great! We moved to the MGM Signature after trawling the strip, which set back from the strip was more the quiet day-time environment we wanted and the price was similar."

    "content": "Very good hotel, but expensive! We spent a week at Mandalay Bay for my company\u2019s annual convention, and it was a truly solid experience. Mandalay Bay is everything you\u2019re looking for in a Las Vegas hotel whether you\u2019re there for business or pleasure, but hold on to your wallet! Room: Stayed in a standard room \u2013 28203 \u2013 which offered a nice view of the strip and the airport; my colleagues\u2019 rooms overlooked the pools area, which also offered nice views. Noise was not an issue at all. The room had a 40\u201d (+/-) HD flat screen TV, and the major networks and movie channels were offered in HD. The room was very spacious, clean, and included two good-sized closets and a large desk. HSIA was $13 per day. The beds were super comfortable, the a/c worked fine, and the blackout drapes kept the sun at bay very well. My only beef about the room was that there was no in-room coffee maker, forcing us to make morning trips down the elevator and through the casino to one of the two Starbucks on site. Bathroom: Large, with nice amenities; separate shower stall and large bath tub. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure. Hair dryer and make-up mirror, his/her vanity sinks, even a small flat screen TV on the wall. No issues. Elevators: Atrocious! It\u2019s hard to fathom how even with a bank of eight elevators serving floors 17 through 32, we had to wait sometimes for as much as 10 minutes for an elevator. As the corridors extend for a great distance from the elevator bank, ask for a room close to the elevators. Restaurants: House of Blues offered the best value and honestly, the best food quality. Rum Jungle is a Brazilian-style steak house and the food was very good there, too. The buffet restaurant food tasted as if it had been prepared yesterday...stale and quite unappetizing...and service was the worst of all of the restaurants we visited. Again, prices are high, with dinner for two at House of Blues (two drinks each, and entrees) approaching $100. Individual drinks at the I-Candy casino bar were in the $10 range, and a rum drink at the pool was $12 before tip. The food court in the convention center was definitely a low point, with surly help, overpriced fast food ($9 hamburger), and no one cleaning tables. Avoid the food court \u2013 especially the Chinese food outlet. Pools: The wave pool and surrounding pools are nicely designed. There are food outlets and shops on the way to the pool, and they do a good job of requiring a room key from everyone in order to keep outsiders from crashing. If you want a chair by the main pools, go early\u2026the staff don\u2019t appear to police those who plunk down towels to reserve chairs for the day, and they fill quickly. If you want a less hectic experience, head to the South Lagoon pool \u2013 easier to find a chair, fewer kids and teens, and a bar on site. Casino: Great, solid casino. Nice dealers and servers. Lowest level Blackjack tables were $15 day or night. Overall, a great experience with attentive but not over the top service. For a taste of \u201cold Vegas\u201d nearby, hop on the free tram to Excalibur, cross the street to the Tropicana, and head to the casino where you can still find $5 Blackjack tables and smaller crowds."

Check out can be avoided via the electronic check out or drop box, but check in is not quick and unfortunately unavoidable."

Not another chair in sight for my husband, tho. What Mandalay Bay lacks is enough lounge chairs (and enforce the no saving rule) and more importantly they lack side tables to put your drinks, phone, magazines etc on. My chair was smuched up against someone else's with no where to put my iced tea or magazines. It is not relaxing to wonder where you will put your drink...on the concrete between chairs and hope it doesn't get knocked over??? The room was nice and was also quiet which was a plus. The casino okay but the Raffles Cafe only so so. And surprisingly more expensive than the Wynn and Palazzo's cafes. We won't be staying here again during the warm months as the pool area is not adequate, but might stay there during the cooler months."

Their process for being oversold is insane. There was a long check-in line at 1 am and we were told upon 'trying' to check in that they had to go in the back for every guest to speak with their manager who tells them which alternative hotel to send us to. As you can imagine, we were not happy, especially after a long flight. So, it ends up we were sent to the Signature at MGM for one night, with $150 food comp for Mandalay Bay included, and $40 for taxis there and back. We enjoyed our experience at the Signature and made our way back to Mandalay to check in and were given a room the following morning around 10 am. So, all in all, it wasn't that bad of an experience, however it was very inconvenient and annoying. The room at the Mandalay was nice, the pool facilities extraordinary. The food options also were good, recommend 'The Cafe' over at The Hotel and also the \"Beach Cafe\" was really nice as well. Room service was acceptable but only average. Please note: If you are given a food compensation, pay your tips in cash. We noticed that after we checked out that we were still charged for the tips we thought we were paying with our food comp. Apparently, that's not how it works. Not a big deal as it's only 25 bucks but still something to take notice of. Had we known, we would have bought a few more 10 dollar orange juices with our food comp :) since we ended up being 'underbudget'. Overall, it's a great resort but a little too far away from all the action of the Strip. We've stayed at Treasure Island before as well and preferred that location because of its proximity to the classier properties: Wynn, Venetian, Palazzo, Caesar's, Bellagio. For a future trip, we're definately staying at one of the 5 I just mentioned. All in all, this place is good for families, gamblers seeking a very quiet place to play (at least during weekdays it's deathly quiet) and young people looking to lounge at their awesome pool for a few days."

    "content": "Staff was rude at check-in. Since we were not staying through the weekend they tried to give us the worst room available. They also said no suites were available because we were not staying through the most expensive night (Sat.). Room smelled like smoke even though it was supposedly a non-smoking room and my allergies were on fire as a result. Air conditioning simply would NOT cool the room down no matter how low we tried to set it. Water pressure was gone one night so we could not shower before bed. No refrigerator, coffee machine, or microwave. Rooms are boring with no taste at all to the design and you have to pay extra for internet access! Even 2-star hotels have free internet! 4-star my [--]! P.S. Mandalay Bay is also the only hotel on the strip full of kids. So if you want to be surrounded by kids, instead of adults as you'd expect in Las Vegas, choose Mandalay Bay. If you have kids I would say take them somewhere other than Vegas because it's not really a place for children. I won't be staying there again. Treasure Island, Mirage, MGM, Planet Hollywood are all cheaper and better than Mandalay Bay."

    "content": "20 years ago my friends and I would go to Vegas for the weekend for a cheep getaway. $100 would cover travel, food, hotel and some fun. These days, $100 would only cover a Sunday Brunch for two. This comment is not limited to the Mandalay Bay H&C, I am talking about the Vegas strip. $1000/weekend (Air/Hotel/Food/local transportation/1 show) for a couple, and you got out cheep. The Mandalay Bay H&C is a great resort/hotel/casino. Large and Busy. It was busy the weekend I stayed there, however, i believe the busy season starts when the kids are off from school. Overall I was very satisfied. The elevator delays are not as bad as some reviews make them out to be, however, I have been told I am a patient person. With regards to the pool, it is huge and beautiful. However, on a Sat morning, if you are not in line to get in by 8:40, 20 minutes before opening, good luck getting a lounge chair. You will be sitting on the floor, if you are lucky to find some space. Even if you plan to splurge, and you/your group plan to get a cabana at $350/day (for 3-5 persons max), good luck. They are generally sold out in the main pool area. The staff will probably recommend the off site pool, which doesnt sound too appealing. We enjoyed the Cirque du Soleil LOVE show. It was great. It was the only show I have attended where the front rows are not the best seats in the house. I recommend 5-6 rows and up. I will probably return to Vegas, and will be happy to stay at the M.B. However, I can think of many other destinations which will cost my wife and I less than $1000/weekend"

However, a few things about the room itself were a little annoying. One, they use all florescent bulbs, which I understand, but they take a minute or so to fully brighten. So when you turn on your lights from being out all day/night, its still dark for a while. Secondly, they don't use fitted sheets... They just lay a sheet on the mattress and when you sit for a while on it, or after you wake up, the sheets are off the mattress exposing you to whatever kind of fluids may be on that mattress... Finally, the toilets have some kind of pressurized flushing system installed. Again, I understand the conservation reasoning behind it, but every time you flush the toilet in that small toilet room, it sounds like a small bomb going off. Its very loud!! But, like I said, small issues, doesn't detract too much from the overall stay."

This is our tenth trip to Vegas, and try to stay somewhere new each time, so MB was our next hotel to cross off our list. Check-in line was so long, people were backed up through the lobby into the casino, so we checked our bags, gambled, had dinner, etc. Went back at 9:00 pm to check-in and still had a half hour wait. Only two of the many stations were open. They need to man their front desk much better :( three people is not enough when they have 50+ people waiting. The King bed we had requested was not avail, so we got two queens, no biggie, but just another thing that wasn't to our liking. Finally got to our room and was impressed how appointed it was, but then disappointed when we looked outside. No real view to speak of. We could see Luxor if we craned our neck to the right a little, but big whoop. The room was very clean, loved the his and her closets and the flatscreen, and the stonework bathroom, but the small TV in the bath was broken and was not fixed the entire time even though we left a note for housekeeping. Bathtub was a little small, but had plenty of hot water. Double sinks are great. Shower was nice with rain showerhead. Doors to bath were more like shutters and opened and closed hard. Air conditioning was wimpy, plus maid kept turning it off, even though we wanted it on so it would be cooler when we returned. Pool area - awesome with wave pool, lazy river ($20 to rent a tube - no thanks, it was better without it anyway) and side pools, BUT there were absolutely no chairs available to sit on. Lounge chairs were either occupied or saved with \"stuff\" despite the signs that say \"no saving chairs.\" They need to enforce this better!! We finally sat on beach towels until the party next to us left. Drinks at pool were pricey - $32 plus tip for a bucket of five CANS of Corona. Cabana girl only came once, and we had to get her attention. Hubby was disappointed that the only blackjack in the casino were $10 minimum tables. He's not a big gambler and likes $5 hands, so we had to visit other casinos for that. Only ate at the Starbucks for breakfast one day, ate elsewhere the rest of the time. Buffet seemed pricey, so we skipped it. (Note: Casa da Amore off the strip was awesome. Food was off the hook. They have a free limo pick you up, but it was booked for the night we went. We had a rental car anyway.) Valet service at MB was hit or miss on wait times for your car. They did give us bottled water (sometimes cold, others warm) each time you give them your claim ticket. All in all, was a nice hotel at a great price, just not a details hotel. If you want to be pampered more, I suggest the Venetian or Bellagio."

It was on the top floor \u2013 62. the penthouse suite\u2026 1,610 square feet. Best view of the strip you can imagine\u2026 especially at night. I was cursing my crappy camera because i just could not get a good picture out of it. we were litterally right beside the sign at the roof that reads \"Mandalay Bay\" the suite had everything. a kitchen, dining room, two bathrooms, sitting room, living room and a beautiful bedroom featuring the most amazing bathroom ever. this bathroom had a giant Jacuzzi tub, two showers and a steam room. My description does not do it justice. It was simply the best hotel room I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. it was twice the size of my condo. Furnishings were high-end and in terrific condition. We should have known we were in for something good when we were escorted to a private unmarked elevator and the door to our suite had double doors, lol. this was and is likely to be the nicest room i'll ever have the pleasure of staying in. we ordered room service twice, once in the evening for appies and a cheese plate and once in the morning. both meals were excellent and the service was impeccable. they actually put down a table cloth and set the table for us. when we had the appies served, my dad was fiddling with the tv, trying to get his camera hooked up, so we could look at pictures. the room service guy came over to help, and when he couldn't get it it working, he sent for another employee that came up and managed to get it working. we didn't even ask for help, they just jumped on it. overall we loved the hotel... it was our first time staying there, and that room definitely raised the bar. we loved the beach pool, and over the course of our trip ate at border grill (my fav place to eat in vegas - so delish!), the buffet for lunch (good selection, okay service), house of blues for lunch (always happy with the food there) and shanghai lily (good food, but i'm not sure i'd rush back. there's better options in that hotel i think)"

The buffet was on par with other nice hotels such as Bellagio, Paris. I had a nice massage at the spa. The spa amenities are great, but it was crowded. I also went to the spa at THE HOTEL and Mandalay Bay, which I preferred. Also, obviously the Mandalay is not as centrally located on the strip, so we took cabs to other attractions."

It just happened to be record high temperatures the week we were there for the Month of May. It was 114 degrees which was a bit hot. We spent most of the time at the pool. One day we rented a cabana by the lazy river. It might seem expensive but it is well worth it since you have it for the entire day. The lazy river was great and its worth $20 for the rental tubes. The wave pool is nice as well. Never had a problem with getting a lounge maybe because it wasn't the weekend. Also no problems with the elevators. We had a room on the 11th floor so maybe the higher rooms have issues but we had none. I was concerned due to other reviews I had read prior to our trip. But we had no prolems. Our only real issue was with the valet parking. You can self park but we figured why not take advantage of the \"complimentary\" valet parking. First night they lost our car. It took them over 20 minutes to get the car to us. They were extremely apologetic but it didn't really improve anything. Everytime we wanted the car we had to wait, and wait, and wait. That is really our only compaint. Check in was slow but that was the guy at the front desks fault. Other lines moved along but not ours. He was a chatter. I'm all for customer service but when you have a mile long line kindly cut the chit-chat down to a minimum. Check out was simple. We used the express check out and just dropped the keys in the box. I do not know why more people do not do this instead of standing in long lines to check out. So all in all we had a nice experience at the Mandalay Bay. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the sun and swimming. Plenty of pools to chose from."

I liked the shower b/c of the clear glass, however, we also noticed that the drain screen would pop in & out as we were showering. The only negative about the bathrooms was the water. The water is SUPER chlorinated - so much so that it would leave water stains on the clear glass shower doors & all over the sink. Also, it tastes DISGUSTING when you are brushing your teeth & leaves your skin SO dehydrated that I was constantly putting lotion on. Also good was the casino. We loved that they obviously have put in an excellent ventilation system b/c we were not bothered at all by smoke, unlike other casinos (NY NY anyone?) who clearly haven't bothered to put one in! Negatives: THE POOL: I had such HIGH expectations! Everyone raved about the wave pool, the sandy beach, the lazy river. Unfortunately, you have to 'reserve' a beach chair by 8:30 am or you are forced to walk 1/2 mile to a satellite pool - which was pretty pathetic. I would highly recommend the MGM pool area - they have so much more room & beds for everyone. We did enjoy the casino next to the pool, that was a nice touch :) THE WORST - Fleur de Lys restaurant. We went there expecting top-notch service & food. Both were excellent. The ambiance was great - until they let in a family of four and the mother started breast feeding both children (at separate times) at the table. I know, I know, you're not supposed to complain about that, but when you are at a fancy French restaurant and are paying over $400 for dinner & wine, you expect a little discretion. Obviously, they're just out to make a buck - but lesson learned - I will never go there again! Next time we're trying the Venetian......."

I booked the panoramic suite for our Welcome to Vegas reception but they did not have one available when I went to check in (the previous guests had not checked out by 2pm). :( The replacement penthouse was adequate for our needs but not as good to hold a party in as the panoramic. The two bedroom suite was fabulous. It was enough room for my sister and her family and it provided a great space to store many of our wedding supplies. There is plenty of closet space and enough flat screen tvs to go around :). The bathrooms are fabulous. The 660 room was very nice also. It has a really neat bathroom which has a screened opening to the entryway (sexy!). We did not have a good view as we were on the 4th floor and this is just above the roof to the casino. The view was of the airconditioners and there was a complaint that you could smell the burgers from the restaurant below. FYI: always book your rooms through the hotel website!! I booked my rooms pretty far in advance because of the wedding and since I had booked with the hotel I was able to call back and get lower rates when they made changes. I think in total for the 3 rooms I saved over $2000 by requesting lower rates and it only took like 10 minutes on the phone. As far as restaurants go I feel like Mandalay Bay has dropped the ball on having a nice quick serve restaurant close to the rooms and casino. Their food court is WAY down near the convention center and I did not like any of the options so I never made that hike again. I would like something more like New York New York where you have several good options within a few feet of the casino. Don't get me wrong I love the fine dining in Vegas, I just can't afford to eat it 3 meals a day. I have to disagree with the other posters on this forum and say that I do not like the pool at Mandalay Bay. It is very crowded and I just did not like the atmosphere. We ended up getting a cabana on one of the days just so we would have a meeting place for our group and not have to fight/ search for chairs. I much prefer the pools at MGM and Treasure Island. They both get busy during the high times but the girls and I have never had a problem finding chairs or someone to help with that task. Also, I ordered food when we were at the cabana and it took over an hour and a half for it to arrive!!! Overall it was a great visit. Depending on the rates given I would stay here again. In Vegas your options are endless and really it just depends on what you are looking for as far as price and location."

The Mandalay Bay (MB) is huge. But so are most hotels on the strip. But still I like this one over most other hotels because of the very good choice of restaurants, the rooms, House of Blues and of course Mandalay Beach! Restaurants The choice is great, whether you want to get a huge rack of rubs while you watch a band at the House of Blues, or ennjoy the finer dining at Fleur de Lys or any of the other restaurants. And you HAVE to eat at the Chinese Grill. Make sure you order the tasting menu: awesome! Nightlife? Sure, although the Rumjungle can't compare to any of the high end clubs at other hotels on the strip. Room Last year we had a standard room, this time we had the '600' room. It was huge! Everything is renovated, bathroom was very big. Nice beds, and overall a very nice place to stay for two weeks. Although the room we had was a bit dark: very big room and only 1 small window. O well, you don't stay in your room during the day... There was one problem tough: when we checked in (after traveling for over 20 hours) we just wanted to sleep. It turned out the bedlinen was dirty: it wasn't changed. Then we found a sigar lying next to the hot tub, and a dirty glass. Obviously this room wasn't cleaned very well. After complaining with housekeeping nothing happened. That good me pretty mad, so I called the front desk and within 5 minutes a maid came to clean the entire room. That was the only incident we experienced. I mentioned it again the next day at the front desk. Guess what... they immediately reimbursed my for that night! Now that's taking care of business! Mandalay Beach You gotta love this! I think this is by far the best pool in town. Of course there are a number of pools, but the entire scene is great. Enjoy the waves at the big pool, or enjoy a bit more privacy at the Moorea beach club. The new restaurant they opened last year is a real asset and overall this is a very nice place to be. DOwnsides? sure: you have to be real early to get a 'bed': many people go to the beach, put down a towel or book and leave. Some only come back after lunch .... Also: during the weekends it is pretty loud with a lot of younger people spending a weekend in Vegas. But overall the beach is great!"

Got there about 3:30 and lines for checkin were a little long so killed some time by walking out to the pool area. Came back about 4 and was swiftly checked in. Front desk person very pleasant. Weren't able to accomodate my request for a pool view as not too many people check out on Saturday. Put me on the 34th floor, the top floor below the Four Seasons floors, with a nice mountain and Luxor view. I really like the refurbished rooms with the comfortable pillow top beds and improved furniture vs the old wicker tropical theme. I do find the big desk a little obtrusive when trying to get to the love seat. Had to press down handle on toilet for 2-3 seconds for it to flush properly. No other issues. Saturday night was a Rush concert at the arena. Difficult to find a place to eat without long lines, including my old standby the Turf Club Deli in the sports book. I do agree with those who've noted, they do need more \"fast food\" type outlets for a quick bite. Had a couple of enjoyable breakfasts at Raffles Cafe, the 24 hr restaurant. Didn't have much trouble with the elevators, longest wait probably 5 minutes to ride up. Riding down we would often stop at each floor until the elevator was fully packed, then it apparently switches into express so often bypassed floors 17-26 or so. Riding in elevator Sunday morning about 9:30 heard rumblings that all the chairs were gone, with a long line. I got down about 15 minutes later, no line, probably 25% of the chairs were still available. Slim pickings by 10:30. But as an example two chairs by me opened up and a woman came by and placed a book on one chair, a beach bag on the other. I was there another 1.5 hrs and the \"saved\" chairs were never used by anyone. I found the wave pool fun. Drinks and food pricey, $6 for a SMALL Fiji water. Walked from my room to the monorail at MGM one afternoon, taking the tram to the Excalibur. Took approximately 35 minutes, about what I expected. Smooth checkout, no problem with it being extended until noon."

    "content": "I stayed at Mandalay Bay from May 3rd to May 6th, 2008. I was in town for a trade show that was being held at Mandalay Bay Convention Center. This was my first trip to Vegas. From check in to check out, everything was wonderful! Yes, they should use a queue system for check in instead of picking a line, I suggested it to management while there. I checked in at 10am and received a room on the 7th floor. When approaching my room, I saw it was at the very far end of the hallway, directly attached to a suite. You could smell the cig smoke and hear loud music and people coming out of the suite at 10am! I went into my room and it was gorgeous but smelled of smoke as well. I called the front desk and they moved me to the 8th floor without even having to return to the desk! They just reprogrammed my keys! They were extremely helpful and understanding. Off to room 8111 I went. Not much of a view, but being on the 8th floor allowed me to wait for the lower floor elevators, not once was there a line! I had co-workers on the upper floors and they did have to wait up to 20 minutes sometimes. So, not having a view wasn't a bad thing! Anyway, the room was gorgeous! A standard room, two double beds. The TV in the bathroom rocked! I took four bubble baths while I was there, just because I could! :-) The oversized bathtub and separate shower were great! The bath soap was by far the best I've seen in any hotel. I took one bar home and am desperately trying to find out how to get more! I wasn't in my room much, but it was nice to feel pampered in a hotel for once! I got there on a Saturday and went down to the pool area by 11 am. There was not a chair to be found! No biggie. I found a spot next to the lazy river, laid my towel down, and got some sun. A man completely soaked me when getting out of the river and felt bad. He and his family were getting ready to leave and offered me their chairs! There were an abundance of chairs on Sunday. The casino was fun! I only played slots and I lost, but oh well! Compared to other casinos on the strip, I definitely noticed the cig smoke a lot less at MB. I wanted to get a tattoo at the onsite parlor but the house minimum was $250! No thanks! I only wanted something very small. I ate at Red, White & Blue twice. Once for lunch and once for dinner. Yummy food and even yummier drinks! Everything is more expensive in Vegas, but, it's Vegas! Loved the tram to Excalibur! Was an easy way to skip a few blocks and get to New York, New York and MGM. I discovered the Monorail behind MGM and took it to Sahara so that I could cross over to Stratosphere and ride the rides at the top! We didn't know about the tram the first night and we walked from MB to Paris... ouch! My feet were killing me! Anyway, Mandalay Bay was a great hotel, and yes, it's at the end of the strip, but I like the fact that it didn't have a tacky theme, etc. Having the Tram made it easy to get around. I will definitely return to Vegas and would definitely stay here again!"

    "content": "Mandalay Bay is the essence of what we've come to expect at Las Vegas hotels. The rooms are huge and comfortable with brand new bathrooms and beautiful showers. Our room had a comfy nook where you can hook up your laptop and work, and the wireless internet works all over the hotel, so you can work down by the pools if you want to -- and you definitely do not want to miss that. There is of course the \"wave pool\" which simulates a beach, and the \"lazy river\" that lets you float and flow... Overall this place was a joy. My only complaints were: In order to use the state-of-the-art fitness center, you have to pay for use of the spa for the day, something like a $30 fee. Now, the spa is BEAUTIFUL and totally worth the fee, but if you just need a workout, it's kinda pricey, and in my opinion, should come free with the room... but I think a lot of upscale hotels operate this way now... The maid service was problematic. First off, when we turned down our bed, we noticed the sheets were kind of dirty. They came and replaced them with no real apology. Believe me I'm not a picky person, but clean sheets are kind of basic. I also noticed some of the bathroom supplies were missing when we arrived because they were added later. And there was only one roll of toilet paper -- we had to ask for more! Finally, we really wanted to lounge around in robes and were surprised that they weren't provided and so we called housekeeping and it turns ou tthey were supposed to have been provided. Other than that, it was a great stay, and I'd still recommend it for sure!"

Rooms were nice, but we could constantly hear the other room's doors slamming at all hours of the night. Tub was dirty, but we didn't end up using it anyway. Pool area was gorgeous, but there were WAY too many people. Wave pool was BORING! There was a wave only every 5 minutes. I'm sure it's a safety thing, but it was a little disappointing. Regardless of the \"little things\", it was a very pleasant stay and we would stay again. One drawback is it's on the far end of the strip-we were constantly on the tram that ran from there to the Excalibur."

    "content": "Just came back from a 3-night stay at MB. We booked the 550DR room and were very happy. Never had a problem with the staff. Always greeted with a smile and \"Hello/Have a nice day\" whenever someone passed us. Yes, MB is at the far south end of the strip but there is a free tram that runs express to Excalibur and then MGM is just across the bridge from there. It was nice to walk around a bit especially if you're eating at the buffets! CHECK-IN: We checked in around 11:30am and were told a king-bed room wouldn't be available until 3pm but a double-bed room was available now. We wanted to settle in and hit the pool so we opted for the double-bed room. Check-in agent was very friendly and also gave us 1 free pass for the shark exhibit for providing an email address. Would be nice if they had a 'first-come, first-served' system instead of just picking the shortest line and hoping for the best. We waited about 10 minutes. ROOM: We had a room on the 4th floor facing north so we had a decent view of the strip. Very well appointed with his-n-her closets, double-sink bathroom, plasma tv's in both room and bathroom, extremely comfy beds. ELEVATORS: I was expecting the worst after reading all the complaints about the elevators. We only had a small wait once, the day we checked in which was a Saturday. Never had a long wait otherwise. I think it helps if you're staying on a lower-level floor. Tried to take a back stairwell once since the maid told us it goes directly to the pool and ended up in the Four Seasons Hotel?!? POOL/BEACH: The wave pool is awesome! The beach area was quite crowded on the weekend but we still managed to find some chairs. Staff were bringing extras if they noticed you were looking for one. Pool was much less crowded come Monday when we had the wave pool practically to ourselves. Saw some folks with their own tubes and noodles in the lazy river so recommend bringing your own unless you want to pay the rental fee. Mixed drinks from the bar were $12+. The next day we went to Walgreens (north on the strip) and bought drinks and snacks which they let you bring it to the pool area as long as you have no glass containers or alcohol. FOOD: The Bayside Buffet isn't the greatest in my opinion. Much prefer the buffet at Mirage or Belagio. Went to MB's buffet for breakfast one morning. Food looks like it's been sitting under the heat lamp for awhile. Just average. Had some good burgers at Burger Bar in Mandalay Place. Had breakfast our last day at Red White and Blue in MB. You can dine in or grab and go and eat at the counter. Also had dinner at Noodles Cafe - good flavor but my Chicken Chow Mein dish was too greasy. CASINO: MB seems to be one of the better ventilated hotels. Good selection of slots. Didn't play tables so can't comment there. Walk over to THE Hotel - very swanky! Had a great lunch at THE Cafe. Would definitely stay here again!!"

    "content": "I read the last couple reviews posted and apparently I'm one of the few who doesn't think this hotel is fabulous. I will totally agree with the general consensus about the long, unorganized wait for check in, the elevators that don't stop on the way down during peak times, etc. so I won't repeat what's already been said. Here is what I disliked about Mandalay Bay: One of the main reasons I booked hotel was because of the hype surrounding the pool area and the \"sand\" beach. The sand was not pretty. It was seriously the color and texture of kitty litter. I guess I expected the kind of sand you'd find at a real tropical beach - gold or white, fine textured and beautiful. There is nothing pretty about grey grit with cigarette butts and plastics cups strewn about. Of course, it was difficult to see the sand at all because 98% of the beach area is filled with lounge chairs, so many that you can not walk in in the sand, only stick your feet over the side of your chair, if you're lucky enough to get one. Two: Bathroom was not up to par. The remote was missing for the TV. The floor tile in the shower was discolored and cracked. The drain plate was not attached causing it to dislodge with every movement, disclosing a disgusting black drain-gook/hair mixture inside the pipe. Yuck. Three: Went to Shark Reef aquarium - Am I really the only person who noticed the peeling scales and patches of discoloration on the fish? Looks like some kind of fish disease has affected a lot of them, especially in the facial areas. I felt sorry for them. The whole place had an air of disinterest, the hallways and tanks looked dingy, the sealife unhealthy. Four: My husband emptied his pockets when we came into the room the first night - cigarettes, lighter, mints, change. The next day the maid took the change - even though it was mixed in amongst the personal effects. It was the principal that really irritated me - if the cleaning personnel are taking 47 cents per room times 3500 rooms, I guess that adds up. Left me feeling slightly violated. The front desk seemed a bit condescending, suggesting that the cleaning service thought it was a tip. Five (and final since this is getting long): I left my cell charger plugged into the wall. Called mere hours after checking out and informed front desk staff of exact location of charger in room. Was immediately given an answer that \"nothing was turned in\" and then a drawn out silence from staff with no further suggestions or offer of assistance. Guess I will buy another charger. Overall, I did not feel Mandalay Bay lived up to it's self-proclaimed reputation. This was my fifth stay in Vegas. I've concluded that there are too many great hotels to accept sub-par service especially coupled with the cold disinterest of staff. On a final note, the entire place is pumped up with pineapple coconut scent. Really. All of my clothes smelled of pina-coladas when I got home."

First what we liked: fast efficient check-in and check-out, courteous staff, amazing view from our room(33rd floor), although we are both not much gamblers we found the gambling area to be well ventilated and clean. Now why we won't go back: our sheets were not changed on our bed only the bed looked like it was done, the carpet was not vacuumed and the toilet was dirty. After waiting 3 hours for housekeeping to come only to wait another hour for someone to show up and clean our room. The hotel is too spread out (yes the Vegas hotels are huge and we admired quite a few) this one was not well planned in terms of shopping/restaurants etc. Everything was all over the place! Compare for yourself to Caesar's Palace or the Venetian and see. Another thing was that we had to wait at least 5-7 minutes for elevators...they were so slow!! The biggest reason we won't go back is that it is too far from the strip!! Next time we will stay at Caesar's Palace, Bally's or Plaza."

We walked into the lobby of The Hotel, and were quite impressed how modern and peaceful it was. We gave the front desk clerk our name, and he checked into his computer but saw there was a problem. He told us to wait a few moments. Of course the few moments, turned into at least five minutes. When he came back he told us that there was a problem with our room. He then surprisingly told us that we would be upgraded to a penthouse suite in Mandalay Bay. What a great surprise. Of course it was a little walk between the 2 hotels but well worth it. The penthouse suite had a panoramic view, 2 bedrooms with bathrooms with televisions on either side of the suite, a small frontroom and dinette. Everything was in excellent condition in the room. Of course this will probably be a once-in-a-lifetime upgrade for us, but we fully enjoyed it. We were not in the hotel much because of having family in the area, but we truly enjoyed our stay at Mandalay!"

Even the mini bar wasn't too costly for a beer! I have no complaints about this hotel at all. Coming from the U.K to the U.S at the moment is fantastic with the exchange rate. The breakfast buffet is HUGE, i have never seen so much food served for breakfast, the choice is amazing. The breakfast buffet at Mandalay is not the cheapest, other hotels had cheaper prices. We ate in house of blues within the hotel which was pretty good. We also ate in a chinese (i think) and again it was lovely. This hotel is massive and i'm quite sure we didn't see it all. One criticism i would have would be that there is no parasols at the pool and the pool seems to close quite early. With the heat in Vegas it could stay open alot later than it does."

I would highly recommend the Rockstar karaoke at House of Blues on monday nights - we were in a large group and we had a great laugh there. I didn't find the position of the hotel on the strip a problem at all - it was really easy to get to Luxor, Excalibur and New York New York - and everywhere else was easily accessible by taxi, of which there were plenty. All of the staff we dealt with were friendly, efficient and courteous. I can't find anything negative to say about this hotel, we thought it was great."

Large, luxurious bathroom with steam shower, soaker tub, etc. Suite was smartly decorated and the king size bed was just wonderful. The price was $170.00 per night, quite reasonable for all the amenities. The staff at Mandalay Bay were very friendly and helpful without being overly intrusive. We've stayed at other hotel/casinos in Las Vegas and found some of them to be \"in your face\".....constantly approaching you to ask if you're coming back anytime soon, etc. Almost like a sales pitch the entire stay! Highly recommend you visit the Shark Reef while you're there. Well worth the price. Also don't leave without enjoying a 5 star dinner at Auerole......you won't regret it. All in all, this was the perfect place to stay. We were pampered throughout our stay and cannot wait to return."

This was nothing compared to the lines I saw as we walked by every now and then to get to the strip. The lines were 20 people deep. I think maybe the hotel is too big for the 10 lines of check in they have. We asked for an upgrade but they said no, that we could buy an upgrade. No thank you. We requested smoking, got non-smoking. (We didn't realize that until we were almost all the way unpacked) So we were off on our 1 room change. This room didn't have as good of a view as the previous one, no big deal though. The shower drained fairly slow, but I didn't think anything of it. Until the day before we left I went to take a shower and the water didn't drain at all. I got out to find that sewage was coming up in the bathtub. (The shower is a stall and the bathtub is seperate.) I have never smelled such a disgusting smell in my life. The water was black. It smelled so bad that my boyfriend threw up. I called to the front desk and they said they would send someone up to fix it right away. So there we sat for almost an hour. By this time I was so frustrated that I told them to move us to a better room. They said no and put us in another room in another tower. So we had to pack up again and move. The beach pool is pretty neat though. NIce place to relax with a big drink. We ate at the Burger Bar. The service was slow and the food wasn't that great. I think the only thing we really enjoyed were the BIG drinks from Ruby Tuesdays. But you can get them anywhere. I think their customer service is horrible. They didn't seem to care that my boyfriend got sick because of sewage. Go somewhere else, not worth the money. We had most of our fun at New York New York. They have the dueling pianos--really funny--2 guys insulting each other and some of the crowd too. Irish Pub was really neat too. They had a singer who took all my requests. Coyote Ugly was pretty cool too. We had a supposed \"free admission\" card we got from some guy on the strip and they tried to charge us $5.00 a piece. I told them no thanks when they told us that and they let us in for free."

    "content": "Just got back from a week stay at Mandalay Bay. Went with my husband and three children and another family. This was our first time in Veags and honestly can't understand what all the hype is about. Vegas is dirty, and the element there is disgusting. Walking on the strip, you are bombarded by people handing out cards of naked women with phone numbers and men with shirts that read \"Girls Girls Girls...to you in 20 minutes\". Open alcohol all over the streets and a less than desirable crowd. The Mandalay itself was a disappointment. Although we had a very nice suite with two king bedrooms and a large living area, it was supposed to be a non-smoking room but it smelled terribly from smoke. When we arrived there was no lighting in one of the bedrooms. One floor lamp was missing and one bedside lamp was broken. We called down several times and waited 2 days for them to correct this problem. The elevator situation was a disaster. We waited very long for elevators and even had to ride the elevator in the wrong direction just to get on. The pool/beach area was a complete disappointment. It is so overcrowded that you can not even see a granule of sand. It was wall to wall people, most of whom had drank too much. Our kids watched people throwing up in garbage cans in the pool area from drinking too much. The lazy river was also a disappointment. It is fast, overcrowded and you get pushed around and soaking wet. Also, not sure if it was from the lazy river or the pool but all who went in from our party came out with itchy rashes on their legs. The best part was the cabana. Although it was expensive, about $300 per day, the cabana has a tv, couches, and refrigerator stocked with soft drinks and water. This was great for the kids. We had a terrific cabana person, Lee, who truly made our stay more enjoyable. He was well informed and extremely accomodating. Would not return to Vegas, but if we did, we would not stay at Mandalay Bay. Check out the Venetian, Palazzo or Bellagio. All seem nicer than Mandalay. Entertainment - There is so much to do in Vegas. Loved the Lance Burton show, the Beatles Love show, the Bellagio Fountains. Make sure to check these out."

Pros - good room, decent rate, lots of great restaurants nearby, check out a breeze, a request for a firmer pillow was met in minutes with such a variety of pillows I was thinking of opening a Bed & Line stall outside the pool area. Cons - worse elevators I have ever seen - what is the problem folks? Why do you have to wait (and wait) then share every trip with 8 other folks? (You know their elevators are problematic when they get cited in numerous reviews. \"Commenting of elevators? Really?\") Check in was chaotic - they need to create a feeder line rather then ask us to play 'pick a line and hope the folks in front of you don't take an hour to check in\" The pool - just too crowded to be enjoyable. You want a chair at the pool? Be there by 9AM as they are all gone by 9:30 or so. $13 a day for Internet is too much. So they don't blow it by any means - but when you start to dread taking an elevator you got to wonder...."

My biggest problem - the infamous pool. What happened to all the space included with your stay? they've added more hotel rooms, yet shrunk the pool deck areas. Big time! A large pay extra beach club - 50 bucks for guys. Drink bars 12 bucks per drink - didn't notice tables. and cabanas popped up everywhere there used to be chair space. oh, for 300 bucks. chairs taken early, can't even walk between them. No chair, absolutely nowhere to sit. not even a ledge. Rooms were pretty good. If you go for sun, good luck."

    "content": "Being a frequent Vegas visitor, I was looking forward to my first stay at Mandalay Bay because of all the nice things I've heard about this place. But until now, the price has always kept me away. This trip, with my players card account, I was able to get some good rates for 2 nights here so I booked. We arrived around Noon on a Saturday, and I went to check-in. My line only had one person in front of me, and then I was assisted by a very friendly check-in person. She was able to accommodate most of my requests (high-floor, fiji wing, looking up the strip, smoking). The only draw-backs were that it was 2 queens when I wanted a king bed, and that the bathroom was a handicapped bathroom (meant more handle bars, no lip on the shower floor)--minor details to me. BUT - the room wasn't ready immediately. They took my cell phone# and said that they would call me when it was ready. They never called, and finally around 3:00 pm, I called the front desk from a house phone (the check-in had lines by now) and they confirmed me that my room was ready. The room was very nice, and had a great view. The bathroom was huge and well appointed. In addition to the 2 queen beds, there was a desk with 2 chairs. Floor-to-ceiling windows afforded the best view looking up the strip that I have ever seen (I was on the 33rd floor). Restaurants were OK. Casino was large and had great selection of video poker and slots (what I play). I didn't use the pool, but walked thru it one afternoon to check it out. Looks great! I did use the spa services which were nice. Now here is the primary reason that I probably will not go back to Mandalay Bay (unless offered free rooms): the elevators were a disaster, especially going to the higher floors. Between the hours of 10 am and 8 pm, there is not only a wait but a LINE extending out of the elevator bank to get on one. Going down can also be a long wait. The elevators are always crammed with people, and very warm and uncomfortable. I don't think there is anything the hotel can do, as it seems that it was just designed that way (inefficient elevators). There should have been 3 banks of elevators and not 2! The tram to Excalibur was helpful, but I still didn't get to \"roam\" the strip as I usually do because of the south-strip location. So the location and the elevator problems will probably prevent me from going back."

We got there on the saturday, which was a really busy one aparently and it took us half an hour to get into an elevator to take us down from our room - there were people everywhere, having parties in the elevators etc. To be fair to the staff after we complained about both the matters they couldnt have been more helpful - they canceled a breakfast bill for the eleavtor problems and gave us a free upgrade to allow us to have a room without a connecting door (room was out of this world) The other two days we stayed there it was abit quieter and you could at least get around the pool area and things werent quite so intensive so we did have a great time"

Check in was a nightmare, LONG lines and slow service followed by an even longer line for an elevator to the 20th floor. The room was nice enough, but there were little things like cigarette burns on the couch (in a non-smoking room), a shower door that wouldnt stay closed, and hair in a corner of the bathroom. We had chosen the Mandalay Bay due to the appeal of its several pools and sandy beach like area around the pools. The pool area was very nice, but we were informed that it would be closing on our 1st night at 5pm because of an event. We were then told that the pool was only open 9am to 6pm including the jacuzzis!! Waits were long at the restraunts we ate at. We ate at the Cafe and were seated right away however we sat and waited for the waiter for at least 15 mins before our drink order was taken, then another 10 before the drinks were brought and our order taken. Another long wait before our food was brought out and then the waiter didn't check back with us after bringing our food. A similar situation happened at another meal in a different restraunt. We were told that they were having a shift change and we would have to wait about 10 mins to be seated. Once we were seated, it was another 15 mins before a waiter appeared. The food was excellent --the service not so much. The following day we had breakfast at the buffet and took the Shark Reef tour which was amazing. When we went out to the pool at 11am, there were no pool chairs available and one of the pools was closed. When we returned to our room, house keeping had been there but had not closed the door. We contacted hotel staff and were informed that security would be there to take a report. No one from security ever came but since nothing was missing we did not press the issue. There was also a very irritating problem with the elevator situation. When attempting to go to the lobby, the elevators did not stop if they were going down. You would have to get on a car going up and ride it up and then down to the lobby. At times, there would be a line of people waiting for an elevator. It quickly became common knowledge to guests that if you wanted to go down to the casino, you pressed both the up and down buttons so that you had a chance of getting a car. One of the elevators even broke down and someone was stuck in it for over an hour. This hotel does not provide free internet access, there is a $13 charge for 24 hrs of service and it is an unsecure connection. Finally, when my husband thought he had left his wallet in the room, he called the hotel and got a recording. He left a message but his call was never returned. All in all, customer service is almost non existent at this hotel! Take your business to the Excalibur or the Luxor, you'll be much happier."

The room is very spacious, the beds are very comfortable with down comforters, I love the bathroom with the tub and an extra shower room. Our view of the LV Strip was spectacular, from our room we could see the whole LV Strip plus a part of the airport. There are many restaurants in the hotel to choose from. The Seaside Buffet is not bad, Raffles is good, Noodle Shop restaurant is excellent! The only flaw is that the housekeeping is rather slow, but I can understand that because the rooms are all big.Oh, another thing which disturbed me was: the elevators are rather slow and always jammed with people. All in all, we love this hotel and will be staying here again soon."

Mind you I go to Vegas 5-6 times a year. We booked off there web site and had a deal with a suite upgrade and a comped night. Line was small which was great when we got there. The lady mentioned to us that the upgrade is available so we took advantage of that. She asked us if we wanted to upgrade to the penthouse suite for and extra $50/night? So we did. First of all the Penthouse suites are the top floors of Mandalay Bay. They have there own private elevators. We were 1 floor from the roof. Upon entering the room we noticed how big it was. It had plasma tv's everywhere. The room had a bar in it. We had this fancy stereo system. The bathroom had a plasma tv in the mirror. It also was huge. The strip view we had was awesome. Also had a great view of the mountains & airport. Really cool watching planes land & takeoff. The bed was super comfortable and slept better than I do at home. I highly recommend staying in the penthouse if you get the chance. 1 funny moment at about 1am our neighbor had a lady of the night pay him a visit and boy O boy did we have some laughs. I will keep this clean. I will say while they were in the \"act\" you can hear her cell phone ring and she answered it like was she not in the middle of anything going on. The whole incident reminded us of a typical porno. The only reason we heard everything was that there was a door that you can enter that room from ours if you had both suites which kind of surprised me."

I'd certainly recommend it. It's gorgeously decorated, staff are helpful and the casino doesn't feel overwhelming (although it is undoubtedly huge) although it is a bit of a trek to actually get to the convention centre... My main gripes were that the lifts were always heaving full of people, the queue for the buffet was ridiculous sometimes (but it's well worth the wait, actually) and the internet access was dubious at best, which was a bit frustrating when I had to do some work... But actually the thing that really wound me up was the cigarette smoke. Despite being on a non-smoking floor I could still smell it in my room. Obviously it was smoking on the casino floor but the air was so dry everywhere as a result of the aircon that I actually lost my voice after a day there - and this was despite not having it on in my room. The view from my room was stunning - over towards the airport and the mountains and the room itself was gorgeously decorated and very spacious. I quite liked being at the end of the strip and the beach was great (but there was no chance of getting a decent spot if you ventured out after 10am). The variety of bars and restaurants meant that you really didn't have to leave (which is kind of the point) even if the quality wasn't always the best. When I go back I'd definitely consider here, but I'd probably kick up about the room/aircon/cigarette smoke issues to the management."

    "content": "Just back from the Mandalay with a group of friends. The review can be separated into a few very distinct parts: 1. Arrival - no bellman anywhere near the door. Had to take our own bags from the taxi into the hotel (a good 50 yards), where we had to wait on a line that was easily 15-deep - and this was at midnight! A miscommunication between Expedia and the hotel had screwed up the booking, and it took a good 20 minutes to get things resolved and check us in. 2. The room - quite comfortable and well-appointed. Beds were incredibly comfortable, HDTV worked nicely, shower and toiletries were up to par. Room came with a large soaking tub, which we never used. As with any hotel of its caliber, the minibar was overpriced, and internet was $13 a day - criminally expensive in an era where most chains offer it for free! We were placed on a low floor (told nothing else was available), which offered a fabulous view of the ventilation system. 3. The property - huge. Overblown, even. You can walk for a half hour and still be within the casino. Hotel has a huge pool complex, with a nice wave pool at the center. Get there early for chairs! Cabanas are available for rent, for hundreds of dollars a day (I'm not kidding). Drinks were $12 each, and access to the \"beach club\" - a separate area where topless bathing is allowed - is $50 for men. The hotel goes out of its way to rip off visitors, particularly in relation to the services involved. Nonetheless, much of it was fun. 4. The food - of all the hotel's restaurants, we only made it to the buffet, which was mediocre at best. This was highly disappointing, given the nearly $30 a head we shelled out for it. 5. Check out - super-fast. The bill was correct, we checked out on the television. Bellman came for our bags, stored them for the day. When we returned before our flight, the bags reappeared within 5 minutes, were quickly stowed in cabs, and we were off. All in all, a nice property, but just too large to provide any real attention to the guests! Reasonable prices for amenities might be nice as well..."

Here is what made my experience so unpleasant: No service, any where, any how! When you arrive, though bellmen are in front, they do not offer to hold the door, as you struggle in with luggage I sat at a bar by the pool for one hour. There were 14 guests, three bartenders, but not one asked me if I would like a drink. Rather, they flirted with the very young girls at the bar. The pool was a mad house on the weekend. During the weekday, there appeared to be lots of room at one section of the pool, but to my dismay, they had cordoned off half of the pool area, and pushed everyone in one big mob! I had to move to the Luxor my last day - really bad too. But, they claimed the move would be easy, because there was a Tram. Went to the tram station - about a 1/4 mile hike with my luggage. It was out of operation. Hiked back for a cab. The bellman were not even informed of the lack of tram service. I hate the way cabs are managed in Las Vegas (this is not specific to the Mandalay). There are 30 people waiting in the line, and there are 50 cabs waiting, but the cab guy will only call one up at a time, for fear that he may not get his well-earned tip for opening the door for each cab. It is all about the staff, not the guest. In Chicago, they call them up - 2 or 3 at a time - and move them out fast and friendly. And - nickel and diming you every step of the way! No coffee, tea or water in the room $14 for internet service! I hope to never return, but if I must, I will stay at the Four Seasons - which is attached - and a civilized, lovely experience."

If you are leaving the room in the early morning and want it cleaned up before you return for a mid-day nap - just call before you leave the room and they get right to it! Another nice gesture (if you take time to ask) is that they allowed us to stay until 1:00pm on our day of departure (normal checkout is at 11:00am). Just call the front desk the night before you're due to check out. Pool is a hit & miss as far as availability of chairs. We arrived on a Tuesday and there were no chairs at all. We had to walk around for quite a while before spotting someone who was leaving. The problem is they don't put \"towel drops\" in convenient places so many people just leave their towels on the chairs when leaving so you have no idea if it's occupied. Returned to the pool on a Friday morning and practically had the place to ourselves. No problem getting towels (despite previous postings about that issue). Lazy river at the pool is fun - definitely bring your own inner tube if you don't want to rent/buy one. If you ask nicely, they'll blow yours up for you. If you don't want to \"stand out\" too much - buy a pink tube as they were selling pink ones with their logo. Music is constant so if you're looking for a quiet pool spot - it's not the place. House of Blues - always great entertainment. Other bars/lounges are fun - makes up for the casino being quite quiet. Elevators are slow, Overall, I'd go back in a minute!"

Upon first entering your room (I stayed on the 19th floor), I was happy to see a comfortable bed (great mattress), a high def TV, and large bathroom. However, a closer look brought disappointment throughout the week. The shower stall looks good, until you open the large glass door. There were very long black hairs all over the wall, and mold in the corners running down the wall, as well as along the bottom (caulking). Between the two beds, was an imprint of a foot, which actually looked like blood (dark red). Obviously a stain that no one had ever attempted to clean. The air conditioning did not work, and little air came out, though we set it on 65 with a high fan. We called for maintenance (which showed within 15 minutes), and was told the filter was completely solid with dirt/filth......great! We showed him the footprint, and he looked amazed, but stated only housekeeping could handle such a problem. Well, it's housekeeping that proved to be the downfall of this hotel. The black hairs I mentioned previously? They were there the entire week (so we used the tub). The second day, we were not given fresh soap, and the shampoo bottle was half full. It looked as if we were just given a left over bottle that another room hadn't finished. We called for soap and more toiletries, which arrived about an hour later. However, each day proved to be the same.....not all was replaced. The glasses (both water and wine) were very dirty. And even when we cleaned one to use, they were never replaced with clean ones. The ice bucket (omg) was so disgusting, and no bag placed inside, that we ended up buying a plastic bowl to keep our ice. Oh - and my sheets had a huge rip in them. On our fourth day, I was opening our door as housekeeping was in the hall. I asked for fresh towels, and was handed bath towels that were damp. Now, were they taken out of te dryer too soon? Or refolded from the rooms prior to mine? I hate to think, but it is obvious that this hotel cuts corners as much as possible. Even room service doesn't pick up dirty dishes left in the hallway for 8-10 hours. Not sure if that was the reason for the funky smell that was always on our floor. Supposedly this was a non smoking floor, but guests were definitely smoking. The website also boasts a great pool with tons of sand shipped in. HOWEVER - what a huge disappointment!!! There are so many lounge chairs, your feet barely touch sand! It is literally a sea of chairs with no room for guests. We were practically laying on top of each other. So unless you can afford a Cabana for $300 a day, you have no room. And even the cabanas had lounge chairs directly in front so they have not much room either. The lazy river looks fun, but the length is not worth the $20 charge. Nope - nothing is free for guests at Mandalay Bay. It is the absolute last hotel on the strip, hence it is the furthest away from everything. We are planning another trip to Vegas in a few months, but I will not be staying at Mandalay Bay. Sorry MGM, you could do ALOT better with improved housekeeping, as I heard is pretty good at your other hotel, Circus Circus, a much less expensive hotel than Mandalay Bay."

We ate at three on site restaurants; Thurs, buffet dinner was fantastic & reasonable for the price. Large choice of items, loved the sea food selection. Raffles for breakfast. House of Blues was quiet in the late afternoon for early dinner. Service was excellent service in all three restaurants. Sunday morning Gospel Buffet was a wonderful way to start the day out, before heading to the airport. Seating was a little crowded. This is my daughter's favorite hotel to stay in and I can see why. The design is similiar to Sheraton Resort at Poipu Beach, in Kauaii, Hawaii. When you enter the hotel it smells like the tropics. One draw back the pleasant smell disappears as more guest arrive smoking cigars(This was a major boxing event week-end). being a non-smoker it was nice to get a room that was smoke free. This hotel is at the very southern end of strip and away from alot of the action"

The good news was that they were going to refund our money and comp us a room next door at the Luxor. The bad news was they overbooked and we could do nothing about it. The first room at the Luxor was awful and dirty. After much MUCH complaining, we were giving a nice room by the Luxor manager. The Mandalay Bay management treated us like crap AND DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR CONFIRMATION NUMBER at all! Unless you are a major convention spending huge money you are a peon in the eyes of Mandalay Bay. The front desk operations manager Shaun Kiatrowski (spelling?) is unprofessional. Don't count on things going the way you planned if you book at the Mandalay Bay."

We ordered room service a few times and found it very quick for a large hotel. I cannot comment on the pool area as I went for New Year 2007/08 and did not use it. I loved being at the end of the strip because it WAS quieter, and I used the mono rail/taxi service to travel around. (Taxis avoid the strip and are reasonable and very quick) There are always taxis outside the hotel. I used the buffet restaurant which was gorgeous, all in all I could not fault this hotel, we watched the Mama Mia ishow in the theatre, shopped in the Mandalay Mall which leads to the Luxor and had fun in the 3D cinema there. We only paid 88.00 sterling for our suite so for value it was amazing. I would absolutely to back there as I still have to eat in some of the restaurants and view the wine angel....Feel free to ask me questions."

Good brunch buffet, liked burger bar, and the pool. But all that good outrun the horrible experience I had at he hotel since I couldn't sleep all night. Constant noise of the service elevator and the thin wall kept me up all night. Trust me I'm a sound sleeper. No one in the hotel was sympathetic or helpful about the situation. Not only that, the check in took longer than 30 min even though I had reservation and the service you expect isn't just there. No one apologize, smile, or even acknowledge that I'm seeking service. Too bad for it's a gorgeous hotel. This hotel desperately needs a management change."

    "date": "March 26, 2008",
    "content": "As part of the management of multiple trade events that happen @ Mandalay Bay, I have stayed (and worked at) the big shiny gold hotel more times than I can count - most recently last week. I'll spare details on things like conference centers, exhibition facilities, and business centers for the 99.9% of people here that couldn't care less, and just concentrate on staying at the hotel as a guest. You professional conference planners can e-mail me if you like. Ok, here is the Great, Good, Bad, and Ugly with some bottom line statements / recommendations . . . GREAT * Compared to anywhere else I've stayed at in Vegas . . . whether you're in any part of the casino, walking concourses, or in your room, Mandalay Bay just feels super - spacious. There are high ceilings and wide walk-ways and just abundancy when it comes to personal space. I had dinner at NY, NY one night and Ceasar's Palace another and I just felt extremely claustrophobic. When I got back to Mandalay for drinks it just felt good to have some space again. * The rooms are fantastic. I've stayed in everything from their basic entry-level rooms to a penthouse with a bar, conference room, and steam room, and I've always been very happy. Beautiful fixtures, pretty marble, comfortable bath tubs, stylish glass showers, and plenty of space are included with even the most inexpensive rooms. * Mandalay Bay is upper-end Vegas. The casino, restaurants, and multiple bars are all top-notch. Last week I went to the in-house Chinese restaurant (Fusion - I think) and - WOW - one of the most flavorful meals I have had in a long time. There are some extremely stylish lounges at Mandalay as well. I also attended a private reception at the Shark Reef - and it was great. There is something very peaceful about observing aquatic life that takes you away from the noise and craziness of Vegas. GOOD * Mandalay Bay attracts an upper-end crowd. Look, I don't want to appear to be 'superior' but I get tired of the 'spring break' crowd that takes over Vegas this time of year, and I find depressing the chain-smoking nickel slot 'playing for rent' crowd that you see at most other casinos. They all have a right, but at Mandalay people just seem to dress a little nicer and not act as buffoonish. It's a little more of an upper-end business class crowd. * There is extra attention to cleanliness at Mandalay - everywhere you look anywhere on the property there is someone cleaning something. I'd bet they hire more cleaning people at Mandalay per sq. ft. than anywhere else in Vegas. You will not encouter filled ashtrays next to slot machines and empty bottles and glasses at lounge tables. BAD * As most others say, Mandalay is not exactly in 'the heart of things'. Mandalay is the first thing you'll see when your plane taxis to the terminal, meaning it's at the far south end of the strip. So, you can rack up quite a taxi budget to get around. * Just getting an elevator can be a pain. There is one central elevator bank (for most of the hotel) that can get over-run at times. During a busy show week, it's not uncommon to have a 5 - 10 minute wait for an elevator. UGLY * They have finally taken recent steps to remedy it, but their check-in / out procedure is still one of the worst of any big business-class hotels I have ever stayed in. Instead of a single line for all check-in desks, there are individual lines that seem to take forever. I once had the unique opportunity of waiting 35 minutes (NOT kidding or exaggerating) to check-in as I had picked one of the slow lines, and . . . seeing someone else that came 15 minutes AFTER I did get to a check-in agent BEFORE I did becuase they lucked-out with a line of a faster employee and / or less stupid people. Very frustrating. BOTTOM LINE / RECOMMENDATIONs * Mandalay Bay is right there with the Venetian or Bellagio as a 'tier one' Las Vegas casino / resort. * If you are one of those 'I only use my room to breifly sleep' types, you may actually want to reconsider stying at Mandalay. Part of what you're paying so much for is the big room / nicer facilities. I don't think everyone that posts reviews here understands that. * If you plan on bar or casino 'hopping' you may, again, want to reconsider Mandalay for something more central. If you want to relax more than roam and enjoy a great pool and casino, consider Mandalay. * Don't miss their great buffet for breakfast and be sure to have dinner there at least one night. write me if you wish: jefnac@hotmail.com"

The room was clean, with modern furnishings and a great view (Sure, it was of the airport and not the rest of the strip, but who cares? We were in Vegas!). PROS: - Quiet on our floor! Very relaxing! - Awesome pool. \"The Beach\" was our favorite part of the hotel! Cool wave maker! - A number of good restaurants at different price categories for all budgets! - Comfy bed! Oh, the bed was so comfortable! I haven't slept so well in a bed NOT my own, ever! CONS: - A bit picky on my part: bathroom fixtures were made of brass - and turning green. Ick. - View from our room - but it's what we paid for. - At the southern end of the strip, so if you plan on visiting other casinos, you'll have to take a cab or rent a car. There's a shuttle/train, but it only goes between Mandalay Bay, Luxur and Excalibur! - The shopping selection is not that great. I liked the shops at Caesar's, Aladdin Hotel (now Planet Hollywood), and Fashion Show Mall waaaaay better. I wish we could have stayed here longer! We had a blast and was worth every penny. Enjoy your stay here!"

I think that it's because our room had a door that would allow you to connect to the room next door - so if you are booking try to ask for a room that does not have a door to an adjacent room. There was noise coming through that door and the exterior door whenever people were talking in the hallways. I was also annoyed that the sheet kept coming off the mattress and I would find my face planted onto the mattress. However, the good news is that when I nicely mentioned these issues to the management, they first offered an upgrade, next a free dinner and finally, after my husband got on the phone to negotiate, they took $100 off each night."

    "content": "My husband surprised me with a trip to Vegas to celebrate Christmas last year. He had received some good rates on line from Mandalay! I hadn't stayed at this hotel since 2000 but was very keen to see if it had changed much - which it hadn't! The rooms were still quite fresh and didn't look like an 8+ year old hotel! Check in was OK, however the front desk staff could have been a little more warm and welcoming that's for sure - especially during the holiday season. The check in staff member we got was very unaccommodating to my request for a low floor (due to dislike of elevators). Nonetheless, eventually we got decent room with a nice view of the pool area and airport. The rooms were quite noisy, it sounded like we had a bachelor party going on next door with them banging and crashing around all night. You could hear people walking down the halls and their doors slamming closed. This could have been due to the fact that there was an AFC fight on one of the nights - they may have still been hyped from that? Oh, and beware if you are parking in their parking garage - someone attempted to break into our hire car on 2 separate nights! They didn't succeed and we really didn't care too much as the car wasn't ours. Just beware. The location is OK, but I much rather the other end of the Strip, ie Wynn, TI, Palazzo. The hotel is in great need of more fast coffee shops, Starbucks had unbelievably long lines every morning which forced us to dine in at their coffee shop/diner - perhaps that is intentional?? :) Besides the coffee shop, we only had 1 meal in the hotel and that was at RM's - not too bad, but obviously you are only paying for the name, the food and service was quite average. The gaming was quite tight, but the casino is nice, very open and airy and we never went back to our room smelling like smoke which is always a bonus! I would recommend this hotel, however if you have some extra $$$, try the other end of the Strip too."

    "content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino from 2/24/08 to 2/27/08. Our flight arrived in Las Vegas around 10:15 a.m. We took the Gray Line shuttle that was part of our package deal from the airport to the hotel. Even though we arrived way before check-in time, our room was ready and we were able to go to it right away! We had a lovely room on the 24th floor. Let me warn you that the hotel is absolutely massive, so if your room is towards the end of the hallway away from the elevator bank, it is quite a long walk. The room was very comfortable with a pillow-topped king size bed, large flat-screen TV, his and hers closets, and floor to ceiling windows allowing for a spectacular view. The very large bathroom had both a glass enclosed shower stall and sunken tub, his and hers sinks, and another (smaller) flat screen TV. I took full advantage of the tub and TV after a long day of walking all over the Las Vegas Strip. It was just what I needed to regroup before heading out for dinner and nightlife. Housekeeping kept the room spotless, and we tipped them, of course. Contrary to other reviews, we didn't hear any noise at all while in our room. Maybe we just lucked out with quiet neighbors. At times, however, it was a bit of a wait for an elevator. This was my third vacation in Las Vegas (first was in 1996; second was in 1999), and I had several layovers there between 2000 and 2005 when I worked as a flight attendant. I must say that compared to previous years, the restaurant choices now lean very heavily toward the high end. In the past, the casino restaurants ran the gamut from moderately priced to high end--something for everyone. Most of the restaurants at Mandalay Bay had prices that would make your knees buckle. Their Eye Candy lounge on the casino floor sells whole bottles of liquor and wine at prices ranging from two-hundred dollars to thousands of dollars. No lie. At the more down-to-earth Bayside Buffet, however, I had the best breakfast I have ever had ANYWHERE! For $15.99 pp, you may overindulge on fresh fruit, made-to-order omelettes, bacon, sausage, skirt steak, lox, eggs benedict, pancakes, cheese blintzes, chilaquiles, assorted cheese...I could go on. Also, Raffles Cafe is open 24 hours and has moderate prices. I had a large portion of Fettucine Alfredo for $15. We each had the very tasty blackened shrimp fettucine alfredo at the House of Blues. While the dish amply contained five jumbo shrimp, I felt the tiny amount of pasta we got in this $18 entree was more like an appetizer. Other restaurants I would recommend are Cravings Buffet at The Mirage and Le Village Buffet at Paris ($27.99 for dinner). Also, I highly recommend seeing Cirque de Soleil Mystere at Treasure Island. You will be truly amazed! The wave pool was closed during our stay. Only one of the smaller pools was open. That seemed reasonable to me because the daytime temperature was only in the mid to upper 60's and was downright chilly in the shade. Even though the pool was heated, we didn't spend any time there other than to take a look at it. Cocktail service on the casino floor seemed a bit slower than Atlantic City. It appeared to me that relative to the size of the casino, they had fewer servers on the floor. For faster service, I tipped the server $2 up front when I ordered. The server returned frequently thereafter. Even though the hotel is at the end of The Strip, it was in no way out of the way. Inside the hotel, you can catch a free tram that takes you to Luxor and Excalibur. Also, for $5, you can buy a pass for the double-decker \"Deuce\" bus that goes up and down The Strip 24 hours. The pass allows you to get on and off the bus as often as you want and is good for 24 hours from the time of purchase. You purchase the pass when you board the bus. Overall, the hotel was breathtakingly beautiful and spotlessly clean. Everytime I turned around, someone was cleaning something, polishing something, doing the floors etc. However, as we are just regular middle-class folk, I feel that the hotel is a little out of our league. I think next time, we would prefer to stay somewhere a little more down-to-earth like Treasure Island--I stayed there in '99. One last note: We flew home on the red-eye, so after checking out of our room around 11 a.m., we were able to check our luggage with the bell captain free of charge (we just tipped him), allowing us to enjoy one last day on The Strip . They give you a claim check, and you pick your luggage up whenever you want before heading to the airport."

    "content": "We came to Vegas for a long week at the beginning of March 2008. I found a great price for the 550 sq foot room + nonstop air from Baltimore on USAirways.com. They beat every single one of my usual travel Web sites (note: this was through their vacations section of the site) I had never been to Vegas before and was there mostly for work so this review isn't geared towards the casino experience. The room felt plenty large for my husband and I and we had a lovely view of the entire pool area from the 19th floor. The bathroom is large and has a TV and a phone, if that matters to you! The beds were very comfortable as well and the enormous flat-screen TV had my husband drooling. The pool area was fun for short periods of time but I found the crowds a little weary. We're not all inclusive types of travelers and the crowded pool and tons of children made me think of what an all inclusive resort would be like. The wave pool was freezing and there wasn't a single person in it. Oddly, the other pool's temperatures varied every day. One day it felt like a warm bath, the next freezing and back again. I guess what surprised me most was just how expensive Vegas is. We thought breakfast at Starbucks would be the thrifty choice for breakfast until our rude awakening at the cash register! What would probably cost us $15 at home (and we live in a city) was $25 here. My husband needed allergy medicine at the sundry shop and had to fork over $16 for Claritin. It was pretty painful. The Border Grill was great (both for lunch and dinner) and room service actually seemed pretty reasonably priced. The elevators were slow, often didn't work and were generally an irritation throughout the weekend. We didn't mind being so far down on the Strip and I liked watching the planes land from our bed! That being said, anyone who doesn't like walking or has physical disabilities might want to look at one of the more central casino/hotels. There is a tram to the Luxor and Excalibur but that seemed like more of a bother."

The wave pool and lazy river were awesome, we stayed in there for hours every day. Our hotel room was very nice and much better than I expected! We also attended the Justin Timberlake concert at the mandalay convention centre and it was awesome as well! The restaurants in the hotel are quite pricey but we did eat at the mexican restaurant and it was very good (and so were the marguaritas) and the chinese/thai restaurant which was delicious and not too expensive. The only slightly bad point of the hotel is the slow service at the front desk, but that wasn't enough to put a damper on our trip. We visited the liquor store right across the street from the hotel to keep some drinks in our room, and it was so cheap! Another good tip is to visit the Fat Tuesday's bar in the basement of the MGM for delicious and cheap frozen drinks!! And keep your glass for discounted refills! All in all we had a great time in vegas and can't wait to go back!!"

    "content": "While the Mandalay Bay is a beautiful hotel and has a lovely fresh smell I would never go back. First of all the bed was too soft and I couldn't sleep on it the first two nights. At 3 am of my first restless night I called the front desk and got an attitude from the girl. Although she suggested sending a cot up she could not suggest how to do it without waking my sleeping husband. He can sleep on anything. By the third day I called again and got a more sympathetic agent. A cot was sent up and I slept the third night however housekeeping neglected to clean our room that afternoon. Since we were leaving the next day we didn't call up and complain. Also on the third day I tried to use their advertised WiFi (for a fee of $12.99) and got a very low signal. I then tried to use their ethernet cable with no success. I called their tech help and after a while of trying different things she told me that there must be something wrong in the room and would have to send up a technician. Since I had little sleep in the last two day I was in no mood for a technician. Too be fair I did like the atmosphere of the Mandalay Bay but my stay was awful. We did get the upgraded room as advertised in their promotion and they did locate our room close to the elevator as requested. But the bed was not firm as I read in the Frommers guide book. Also there is no coffee pot in the room so you will have get room service or buy your coffee in the lobby. Also there is a very pricey food basket and mini bar which we were told by the front desk is weighted and any movement of the items would result in a charge to our room."

We had booked two of the 550 Deluxe Rooms, one with king bed and one with two queen beds. We were checked in within minutes, with all requests granted, and rooms located in the same hall. Check in was quick, effiecient and pleasant. Rooms were on the 17th floor with decent views. King room had couch and chaise lounge, desk, dresser, his/her closets, and a very comfortable bed (new pillowtop mattress with featherbed on top). Bathroom had an oversized tub, step-in shower, double vanity and seperate toilet area. Rooms were clean, well serviced and very quiet (nice surprise). Maybe it was the floor, but we never waited for an elevator, the 17th floor is the first stop for the second bank of elevators. Nice work out facility and spa, they even had one pool open for year round use (another nice surprise). The main beach and pool section opens in March. Large casino. We noticed that the limits on the tables dropped on Sunday night. Numerous restaurants and clubs, and bars. Every place we ate was very good, also expensive - but no more expensive than any of the other hotel/casinos we visited. We experienced friendly service from everyone, never waited more than a few minutes for a cab, and were checked out in less than 5 minutes. We had originally booked the Bellagio, but were able to stay here for an extra night and the trip was about 35% less, leaving us more money to play with. It did not bother us that this hotel is on the south end of the strip, it was a great place to stay and when we wanted to be in the thick of things we just took a cab to the main area of the strip and walked from there."

    "content": "I spent two nights at Mandalay Bay during the Taylor/Pavlik fight in February. I was in the company of a whale, so everything was done first class. We were comped a two bedroom suite overlooking the strip. The view and appointments were magnificent, however there were numerous problems with the room. First, the minibar was locked. It took forever to get anyone on the phone and they insinuated that I was too stupid to open it. It was electronically opened at the front desk, but apparently there was a short in the system. I was told that it couldn't be repaired until the next day (It was ultimately fixed .... until I closed it for the first time and it relocked!). Phone service was a fiasco. On several ocassions, I'd try to contact ANYONE in the hotel. I pressed every button on the phone only to get the same message that no one was available to take the call. The suite, while beautiful, was not functional. For example, the doors into the bedrooms were virtually opaque, allowing any light in the suite to flood the bedroom. Also, the walls were so thin that I felt like I was attending the next door party at 3 a.m. The two meals we ate at Mandalay Bay were absolutely magnificent. I ate so much at Strip Steak that I thought I'd be sick. I wasn't hungry, but it was so good I had to keep eating. The Italian Restaurant (Lupo del Trattoria?) was equally good. We played golf at Primm Valley (a long drive and only decent) and Cascata (sublime). Mandalay Bay is at the far south end of the strip. It is extremely remote from the rest of the Vegas properties. It does have a very efficient tram that connects it to Luxor and Excalibur (and thus an easy connection to MGM and NYNY), however, it is an entirely different experience than Bellagio, Caesars, Venetian, Mirage or Wynn. We taxied to Mirage for Cirque du Soliel Love (a good bet if you're a Beatles fan) and on Saturday night, Mirage was an absolute madhouse. We taxied back to Mandalay Bay and were greeted by a ghost town. If you like being in the thick of the action, you'd be better served at one of the properties mid strip. If you like it a little more quiet, Mandalay Bay is the place for you. Very little walk up traffic. All in all, not a bad spot. Beautiful grounds, good restaurants and casino. Just a notch below Bellagio in the service department."

    "content": "Got a terrific midweek rate, $109 per night, on this hotel because an annual sales meeting was canceled. Check-in was smooth, however, the rate I got also promised an upgrade, based on availability, of course. Well, I never got that upgrade. The room was a good size and very clean. I especially liked the large flat screen HD TV, with some HD channels. The bathroom was huge with a separate tub and shower stall. The toilet was in its own room in the huge bathroom. The hotel is humongous, as they all are on the Strip. So expect some walking to find a place in the hotel. Mandalay Bay is the most southern hotel on the strip. But I did not find that to be a nuisance at all, as there is a free tram to Luxor and Excalibur, which we took quite often, especially late at night. That end of the strip tends to be isolated and empty at night. And I would definitely recommend the Shark Reef attraction at the hotel. The aquarium is well done and you get a listening device with your ticket that allows you to really learn about the species of fish in the tanks. We did not eat at the hotel, so I can't comment on the food. Checkout was a little frustrating. Since we had a very early flight, we were down at the lobby at 5:15 AM. There were two agents checking guests out and the line was about 6 people deep. Turned out there was really only one agent checking people out as the other agent was spending way too much time with a couple looking to check in. After check out, we went down to the taxi stand to get a cab. Lo and behold, no taxis and no Mandalay Bay employee to assist us. I finally found the valet parking guy who told me that I had a better chance of getting a taxi upstairs, at the arrival entrance. Well, I wish there were clearer signs that despite the taxi stand being on the lower level, taxis were available on the upper level at that time in the morning. My suggestion is that if you are checking out early, say for a 7:00 AM flight, give yourself a little bit of extra time for checking out and getting a taxi at that time. Also as an aside, the security line at the airport was extremely long, even at 6:00 AM. Build in time for that too. I would definitely stay here again, because of the cleanliness and space of the room."

    "content": "My husband and I spent a 3-day weekend at the Mandalay Bay and were pleasantly surprised! I had lowered expectations based upon some of the reviews here, but we had a fabulous time. Check-in: We waited about 10 minutes behind a lady that clearly had not done her homework or booked in advance. That's not the hotel's fault, of course. We had booked a package through the hotel which included a complementary upgrade if available. The clerk let us know that upgraded rooms were not yet available, but they would give us what we originally booked right then. We weren't in a hurry, so we decided to wait and were very glad we did! Our room was available around 3:30 p.m. when we called to check on it. Rooms: We had a strip-view room with a sitting area and dining table. Our room and the view were beautiful. I LOVED the bath -- they had a flat-screen TV where it can be seen from the tub -- just like home for me. I don't know why more hotels do not do this. Although the walls did seem a bit thin, we had guest rooms on only one side and we didn't notice the noise. Casino: We thought the casino was just the right size -- not too big and not too small. Food: The restaurants at the Mandalay Bay are fantastic. We had dinner at Aureole the first night at a romantic table with a view of the swans. We love wine, so the wine tower was an attraction as well. All of our dishes were spot-on. We had lunch at the Border Cafe, which was the freshest, most creative Mexican food I've had in a long time. Highly recommended. We also had dinner at Red Square. While a Russian-themed restaurant wouldn't seem to be our first choice, we were blown away by the food and the great martinis. It's more of a russian influence than a true Russian menu, which was fine with us. The ambiance and service was great there as well. Clubs: The only club we visited was the Mix Lounge at the top of THE Hotel. We were there around 10:00, so it wasn't very crowded. We were able to get a small table right by the glass, which afforded an incredible view of the strip. It was here that I experienced the most unique restroom -- the stall in the ladies room was very dimly lit but had a floor-to-ceiling glass view of the Mandalay Bay next door. Quite the experience. Pools: Sadly, we visited in February and while the weather was mild, only a small portion of the pool was open. Shopping: There a few cute shops in Mandalay Place, which connects to the Luxor. However I was greatly disappointed to find out that the wine bar had closed. Location: I think the location is fine for a short trip. It was an easy walk to the tram, which takes you very close to the MGM and NYNY. If I were staying longer, I would probably want something closer to the middle of the strip."

If that's not bad enough, you can't sit on it because the only back rests on on two of the corners. The views? Please. My 6'4\" husband had to stand on the bed, which was in FRONT of the window just to see the view!! And the bed - Mandalay Bay has THE MOST comfortable beds on the planet. In fact, we bought the identical matress sets after sleeping on them for the first time. I don't know what they did, but they now slope downwards towards your head, if that makes any sense. After the first night, we complained and they moved us to The Hotel and it's fabulous. Unfortunately, we won't be staying at Mandalay Bay when we return to Vegas."

    "content": "I have been dying to stay at the Mandalay Bay Hotel for quite some time, and finally got the chance to in Feb. I was taking my fiancee to Vegas for a pre-valentines weekend. (She really wanted to see Phantom of the Opera). Now the problems that I have with the hotel isn't in the hotel itself, although the walls are a little thin (got to hear a nice conversation with my neighbor threatening to kick his friends behind if he should not return the call). Well let me start off with the good. 1. Location: This is probably the most common complaint I have seen on this site, but I love it. Yes, anyone who has been to Vegas before KNOWS that it is far away from the popular spots in Vegas. But despite it being far, there are more than one way to get to the \"action.\" There are trams, (taking you to excalibur), then a short crossing of the street and you can get to the monorail (cheaper then a cab, although a little hike through the labrynth that is MGM Grand), or again you can take a cab (averaging about 10.00 to get to Venetian), or you can use those little contraptions called legs and walk. I myself loved being away from the traffic that the Bellagio has to deal with and would go crazy if I had to wait 30 minutes just to pull out of the parking garage to the strip. 2. Room: The room for the most part was flawless. The bed was super comfy, the Flat panel tv was a nice touch, and plenty of space and seating area. I loved the floor to ceiling windows, and got a great view of the strip from where we were. 3. Bathroom: I loved the bathroom. I loved the tiles and especially the stone floor of the shower. The shower and tub were both very relaxing, and I got to watch tv while in the tub. I liked that the toilet was in a separate room in the bathroom. Water pressure was perfect. 4. Room Service, Valet, Bellman: Room service was right on time both times I utilized them. The food was hot and for the most part delicious. (lunch had a pizza finacee had a grilled cheese sandwich. Dinner we both had Filet Mignon which was delicious). The Valet were quick with retrieving my vehicle and didn't extend their hands for money (of course I tipped them). and the Bellman was prompt with our luggage and told us some things that the front desk should have mentioned. Cons: Front Desk: This was really the only true problem I had with the hotel. I partook in the winter warmth promotion (free upgrade to suite if available). Now I didn't really think I would get upgraded but when checking in my fiancee asked about the free upgrade to which the lady said that we were getting upgraded to a strip viewing room for free. (Now I paid for the strip view room, nearly 50 bucks more) So I asked if I would be getting a refund for the difference, she looked confused so I mentioned that I paid and reserved the strip view room to which she said I didn't I got a standard room. I showed her the reservation confirmaiton and she just handed me my key and that was that. Now again, I had no problems if they weren't available just don't lie to me about upgrading. My big run in with the front desk came later that evening. Turns out that when they took my card they didn't use it for the incidentals, and I had yet to get a chance to buy some water. My fiancee was having trouble swallowing something, to the point of almost choking. We couldn't get the mini bar open (paniced we didn't think about the sink until afterwards). I called the front desk and asked them to activate the fridge. They said that they needed me to come down and present them my credit card for the incidentals. I told them just to use the one I checked in with, my fiancee was choking and we just needed to get a drink out of the mini bar. She again reiterated that if I wanted access to it then I needed to come down stairs. (totally uncaring that someone was choking in the room) So she hung up on me and I remembered that there were sinks in the room, but I was still appalled at the lack of caring that these people had. Especially since, I never once raised my voice to them (as I have been in customer service before I know what an awful job it is and treat them with respect.) Overall: I enjoyed most of my stay here, had a couple of problems with the room and some major problems with the front desk. But overall the room makes up for all the shortfalls. I wouldn't pay the summer rates for the hotel, not worth it, but in the less crowded times it is a great place to stay."

Without knowing it, we received a suite. I'm not sure if it was because of the e-mail special, or if it was because there were no regular rooms available, as many guests staying at the Monte Carlo were moved to the Mandalay Bay because of the fire. I was imagining a large 2-room suite, as what is provided standard at hotels like the Venetian. However, we receieved a large 1 room suite, with 2 queen beds and a couch. The room was very nice, and the beds were extremely comfortable. It seemed to be newly renovated. It had a large flat screen TV and a mini-bar. There is really nothing bad I can say about the room, other than it just wasn't what I expected. The bathroom was great. It had a jacuzzi, a shower, double sinks, and another flat screen TV. The toilet was located in a seperate room within the bathroom. Although we did not have a strip view, we had a nice view of the pool area, which was closed while we were there. I did not like the fact that this hotel was so far down the strip. The only hotel that is walking distance is the Luxor, and there is no point to walk there, as there is a tram that will drop you at either the Luxor or the Excalibur. The tram was broken for part of the time we were there, so we had to take cabs. All in all, it was a nice hotel, but does not compare to what you receive or the locations of hotels like the Venetian, Caesars, the Wynn or the Bellagio."

I got a renovated room and it was absolutely fabulous! huge flat screen TV in my room, flatscreen in the bathroom as well which was perfect for taking baths in the very deep tub that was there. The bathroom was phenomenal - marbel floors, tv, double sink, separate toilet room, large standup shower. The beds were great, very very comfortable. Everything about the room was inviting and new. I loved it! The hotel itself was nice as well. i was there for a conference and the conference center was quite a hike away, but that's how things are in Vegas. I really enjoyed my stay there and although I didn't get to go in the pool, it's amazing to look at. I'd say probably the best pool in Vegas! (Except maybe the Golden Nugget where you can go on a waterslide through the shark tank and get dropped off in the pool!)"

The beds were AWESOME! The most comfortable beds I have ever slept in...I didn't want to leave! For fun, check out the House of Blues adult hypnotist show..never laughed so hard in my life.

Check in lady was lovely, explained everything completley but told me there was a fridge in room, and there was not (but could get one for $10) Was worried upon check in when offered a smoking room due to the fact it was the highest floor available. (she did offer a deororising service if it was too bad at no charge)This was unfounded however as whilst the halls smelt bad, the room itself was lovely and fresh. We had a corner suite which had 2 bedrooms and the connecting living area. My sons loved the MASSIVE plasma in their room and the fact they EACH had a queen size bed. As it was winter we did not visit the pools, but did enjoy all the restaurants that the hotel offered. The only gripe i have about these hotels is the minibar/snacks system. You have 45 seconds to either take it or put it back. This was ok...ecxept my sons who wanted to read what came in the \"adults fun kit\" of which the labels were on the underneath of the box, and the last thing I wanted was to be presented with at checkout was a bill for this item ! :-) Maybe they could put the labels including the calories etc on the front, so you can look and not touch? I can understand why they do this however. It is a bit far down, but we enjoyed the walk and would stay again, as for the quality we recieved was considerably dollar for dollar than thoose further up the strip (approx $550 per night). Have booked this year to stay at MGM signature after reading the reviews....would be happy to stay here again though."

The casino is one of the nicest (I think Venetian is the only other casino I liked better). It is farther from the \"action\" but that's what I liked about it. It really should be ranked higher than 55 on Trip Advisor... it's not a budget option so maybe that explains part of the ranking. Though, other much more expensive places are ranked higher. This was my husband's second time staying here and we both agree this is probably where we will stay again. The only other places I would purposely look to stay at (if the price was right) would be Bellagio and Wynn. You won't be sorry if you choose Mandalay. It's a fantastic property. You never have to leave if you don't want to!"

For the virgin Vegas tourist, Mandalay may seem a bit far from the action (southern limits of the Strip), but other young gamblers like me who have been to Vegas hundreds of times, Mandalay is the perfect blend of everything under one roof. ROOM: Checked in really late (11pm or so)... I booked a regular room, but upgraded to a room on the 60th floor because the hotel desk guy felt my 5 minute wait was too \"long\". That's what I call service. Be warned though, the height is a little daunting... after getting used to it it's great. Room has nice touches: wireless or wired (sometimes you need the extra security) internet though the charge is a bummer. Plasma (or LCD?) TV was perfect size. IPod player/alarm clock was nice. Reading lights on beds useful. Lots of outlets available for charging stuff (annoying when hotels force you to find electricity). Closet is decent size, safe was easy to use. Lots of minibar choices. Bathroom definitely a highlight, small flat screen TV for watching while in the tub. Herbal shampoos and soaps felt high quality. Shower excellent. HOTEL GROUNDS: Was winter so didn't feel like going to the pool even though I was told it was heated. Casino has the perfect selection of everything. In the era of $25 table limits on the strip, having $15 limits available was refreshing (especially for craps). Good amount of traditional $1 slots (I despise video slots) but not enough $5 in my opinion. Poker room was ok, action was limited. Buffet is still one of my favorites, great atmosphere. Breakfast at the late night cafe (can't remember name)... service was slow but friendly. Valet service excellent. FYI my old hotel of choice for the last 5 years or so was the Mirage...however I feel the Mirage is really starting to show its age and doesn't really feel like doing anything about it. Service at the Mirage too has gotten too \"LA\" meaning too much attitude and not enough politeness. In my opinion, Mandalay Bay is now what the Mirage was in its heyday. Nuff said."

Big flat screen in the room, plus a smaller flat screen in the bathroom. Very modern look and feel, great bath products, very comfortable beds...really nothing at all to complain about. The Sportsbook at Mandalay Bay is the best part though. Lots and lots of big TVs and easy-to-read boards. They have the theatre style seats up close, but also have lots of tables and nicer chairs slightly farther back in the bar area, which is very convenient. The Turf Club Deli in the Sportsbook is great. Lots of sandwiches and snacks all day and night, and the Poker room is also in the same area...all in all, a really great place for guys to hang out. I would definitely go back with the guys, but not sure it would be the most romantic place to take my wife."

The bed was comfy, and I had a great view of the strip. That\u2019s where the compliments end. The walls are paper thin. I could hear conversations on both sides. And it\u2019s not like these people were shouting. Normal, quiet speaking voices are COMPLETELY audible. The adjoining room next to me was also separated by an ill-fitting door. When they made coffee at 7am, every morning, my room smelled like a Starbucks for hours. Couple the smell with the talking, and I was up early every day. Then there\u2019s the casino. I\u2019ve seen better in Atlantic City. Bad carpeting, no atmosphere. Very \u201cold.\u201d Not stylish at all. The dealers are even worse. I had one that barely spoke English, and another who was openly ogling women\u2019s breasts. Out loud. Like a construction worker. That\u2019s not first class. Then there\u2019s the smell. MB must pipe in some sort of scent into the hotel, because it\u2019s everywhere. It\u2019s smells like suntan lotion in the lobby, casino, hallways\u2026mix it with the omnipresent cigarette smoke, and it\u2019s like a bad Hawaiian Tropic bathing suit competition from 1980. Room service was terrible. The first morning, it took more than an hour, and arrived cold. The second morning, after nearly 30 minutes on hold, I gave up. Two follow-up calls again netted a message that all operators were busy. Indeed. This place isn\u2019t hip. The service isn\u2019t 2, 3, or 4 stars. And the rooms are hardly soundproof. This is not luxury. And if you think THEhotel is any better think again\u2026the other members of my party who stayed there said the service was just as bad."

The air conditioning did not put out much air, so it was kind of warm at night. The major disadvantage to this hotel is the location, to far from all the action, the casino was always empty, which was surprising compared to the other hotels. The Border grill was very expensive and the food was so-so. If you called down to the front desk, they never answered. The walls are definitely thin as you could hear tv's, conversations, music, everything, as you walked down the halls. The lobby is so big, you get lost. Check out time is way to early - 11 AM, but I did call down to the front desk and got it extended until 1 PM. I probably wont stay here again.."

    "content": "As an all-too-frequent Vegas traveler (love poker, buffet, and blinking lights), I have to say that this was one of my best trips. This was NOT my first trip to Mandalay Bay, but it WAS my first time going overboard and getting a huge suite here (which I highly, highly recommend, if it is not a deal-breaker to spring for one, at least for a night). I started off in a smaller suite (750 GR- I had to double check the website to get the alpha-numeric room-name combo right). Don't get me wrong, that room was awesome, as are the \"regular\" rooms, which all have sick TV's now- and flat screens in the bathroom, which is cool for no real useful reason. Anyway, moved up to the media suite for a very special occasion with significant other, and all I can say is \"WOW!\" -- I was totally blown away. I've stayed at most of the hotels in Vegas, and this was my favorite room by far so far (I posted some photos). Anyway- the room was great, but I'm really becoming a big fan of Mandalay; from my experience the staff is great (I've ever had a serious problem), the management is AWESOME, the clubs are great (love Mix ), and the buffet (though CLOSED currently!) is primo. Plus the poker room is good, the casino is bright and has a good vibe, and it seems like the crowd is upbeat here! Bonus: it's connected to Luxor and Excalibur (though Excalibur is a gambling jinx for me). Some people don't like the south strip location, but I love it: you can get to all the other hotels within 15 minutes by monorail or cab, or walk in double that. BUT, it's a little quiter in a good way, while remaining appropriately energetic at the clubs and at the tables. There's no good cheap places to eat.... but that 's what Luxor is for!!! just take the 5 minute walk, grab some McDonald's, head back, and enjoy the room! Again, I've stayed a lot of places, but Mandalay is where I keep going back to! GREAT EXPERIENCES HERE!"

    "content": "Had booked the Mandalay Bay as part of a air/hotel package via Expedia and got (what I thought) was an extraordinarily good deal. I had read some great & not-so-great reviews here in TripAdvisor over the summer of 2007 and was a bit uncertain what to expect. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. This was a vacation to relax. I don't gamble. My priorities were good customer service, a clean/well-maintained room and a great spa experience. All three were delivered in spades! The newly renovated rooms are nicely appointed and comfortable. Although the room-type (king bed) that I had requested was not available when I checked-in (11:00 p.m.), they front desk was prompt & courteous about resolving the matter and moving me up to a 26th floor king bed room. I didn't have need for housekeeping all that much, so can't really comment on them. Unbeknownst to me, some of the public areas of the Mandalay were undergoing renovation during my stay (12/15-20, 2007), but they were VERY good about being discrete with the work and I didn't note any disruptions due to this work. However, what I did think was odd was the hodge-podge between the original design and the new design \"direction\"...perhaps it will be resolved when the work is done. However, all looked immaculate and well-maintained. The Spa at Mandalay Bay is FANTASTIC!!! I highly recommend spending time at the spa ($27 per day for a day-pass or free w/purchase of a spa service). The spa facilities are HUGE and are non-coed, but are very conducive for relaxing. Most dining options leaned toward the expensive end of the spectrum, but Raffles (24-hour restaurant just off the casino) was a reasonable alternative ($10.95 hamburgers, $17.95 for half a roasted chicken & side, pricier steaks, etc). Food was very good and service was prompt. Located at the southernmost point of the \"Strip\", the Mandalay is a bit removed from the center of Las Vegas activity, but it is does a good job of providing a variety of dining & entertainment options within its self-contained environment. Cab ride to Bellagio is about $9.00. A guest of The Hotel invited me up to The Mix nightclub and the view was NOT to be believed! Up there, you are higher than the top of the Luxor pyramid light beam! The unofficial \"dress code\" of the hotel varied from super casual jeans & t-shirts to lots of sport coats and cocktail gowns on Saturday evening. In general, the crowd was younger and more attractive than many of the other hotels. Also, word is that the show Mamma Mia will be closing soon. If relaxing is a big component of your trip to Las Vegas, give the Mandalay strong consideration...I'll be back for sure!"

We visited quite a few of the other hotels on the strip whilst there and I think we made the right choice staying at the Mandalay Bay. The hotel seems to be much brighter and more airy than the other hotels, which I found to be quite dark and smokey. The Mandalay Bay also seems more family/child friendly - but noticed they are holding the Adult Film Awards in Jan so perhaps not then. Rooms are nice and we were given a strip view on the 25th floor which was great. We were however dissapointed with the housekeeping - did not feel the room was cleaned properly and the carpet was not hoovered the whole week. Found it very expensive to eat and drink here, more expensive even than at home in the UK! We were expecting things to be much cheaper with our exchange rate. We enjoyed dinners in Lupo, Border Grill, Burger Bar and the Noodle Shop was lovely. Was very dissapointed in Red, White & Blue - both food and service. The buffet was closed through our stay. We're not big gamblers so can't comment on that. We spent a few nights in the hotel. The entertainment at the Kitty Club was fun, Eye Candy is cool and we spent an evening in Rum Jungle which was very promising but then they shut early as it wasn't busy enough so were a little annoyed when we were kicked out! Had a wander round the beach are which looked lovely, such a shame we visited when it was cold. Also visited Shark Reef which was fun. Some good shops in Mandalay Place but they were always very quiet. The monorail between the hotel and the Excalibur was very useful and gave good access to the rest of the strip. Overall, we really liked the hotel and preferred it to the others that we visited."

    "content": "We went as part of a large group to Las Vegas. The Mandalay Bay Resort was lovely. The rooms were excellent. On Christmas Day, we asked for information to visit the Grand Canyon. We decided from the print out given to us by the concierge to go to the Grand Canyon West Rim & Skywalk. The directions told us to go to Kingman, AZ and that the cost would be $25 per person. The directions and price were both inaccurate. When we eventually (after a long detour) arrived at the Skywalk we were told it was $80 per person at least. When we arrived back at the Mandalay Bay we thought that the concierge would want to change the incorrect handout. The concierge on duty informed us that she knew the map and price was incorrect and that the information had been changed. When she checked the handout from her file it was the same one we had been given with false information. She bluntly told us that her printer was broken so she wasn't updating the handout. She was quite short with us. We were extremely shocked at her response as she put the handout back into the folder to hand out to other clients from the hotel. When we had checked out the hotel before arriving in Las Vegas on TripAdvisor one of the complaints was the manner of the staff. We should have paid heed to this warning. The next day we asked her (the exact same concierge-we should have given our heads a shake) for other information about Las Vegas. Once again she gave us inaccurate information. We would not recommend asking the concierge at the hotel for anything. When we went to the concierge at Planet Hollywood she was able to help us out and do so in a very polite, friendly manner."

    "content": "Just got back from 5 days here. Overall, very nice, but doubt I would stay here again. My biggest complaint was the cleanliness of the room, especially the bathroom. I truly feel that hotel maids have a very difficult job and I can understand that things might not be perfect. But this was really bad. (I know I should have called housekeeping to complain, but I feel uncomfortable getting a maid in trouble. Instead, I wish the hotel would take it upon themselves to monitor the upkeep of the room instead of me having to start off my vacation with a complaint.) The dirty fingerprints all over everything in the bathroom was one issue and I ended up wiping them off with a baby wipe so that I didn't have to look at them every time I was in the bathroom! More gross to me was the fact that I'm pretty convinced that the floor was barely washed after the last guest checked out is another. (I wore my shoes in the bathroom the entire time.) The mildew in the shower was gross and while I would never use one of the hotel glasses in the bathroom anyway, the ones in ours were so unappealingly dirty that I can't believe anyone else would either. Also, the last two days, we weren't given the same amount of towels, (like they ran out or something?), the box of Kleenex was left empty for 2 days, no extra toilet paper, no replenishing of the complimentary shampoo or conditioner. None of this are huge things to ruin my vacation, but I'll spend my money elsewhere to have a more luxurious experience which is readily available in Vegas. When we checked out, I did mention that I had a housekeeping concern that I thought the hotel might want to be aware of, but the woman I spoke with just told me to go on to the Mandalay website and contact them through there. On the plus side, we liked all the restaurants at the hotel, especially dinner at The Red Square one night. We needed a cot in our room for our daughter and that was brought up to the room very quickly. Casino was nice."

If you're looking for a place for the entire family, try The Orleans. They've got bowling, a great movie theater, arcade, and child care facilities. Do plan on staying at Mandalay Bay again in the future. E-mail me if you've got questions."

The tables were way outrageous but I guess that's Vegas now. There were quite a few nickel video poker machines, and penny slots, and the dollar bar was fun! It was a short tram ride and then walk to the MGM Grand and the monorail, which was convenient and fun The convention center was quite a hike from our room though, and the amazing pool area I've heard so much about was completely shut down. Not a drop of water to be had for swimming. It was a beautiful hotel, and housekeeping was a joy to behold. Everything was spotless, beautifully maintained and everyone was very cheerful. Overall, a great hotel, but not one I'd stay in for non-business reasons."

The only downside is that it is on the EXTREME southern end of the strip. It takes 20 min to walk from the hotel to the main strip itself. If you want to go see something at the top ( The Volcano at the Mirage, or the Dancing Fountain at Bellagio, shopping!) wear proper shoes! Also if you are looking for a room with a view and you are on the higher floors, all you see is the airport since the airport is literally 30 seconds away. Other then those 2 little things it was a great hotel. If you are the type that gambles and never sees the outdoors then its the perfect hotel for you!"

    "content": "Havent long returned from the amazing Las Vegas and just had to write a review on the Mandalay Bay Hotel and what a hotel it is. We travellon on November 28th from Gatwick on a direct flight with Virgin. When we arrived we caught a taxi straight from the airport to the Mandalay Bay hotel which cost us $12. When you land at the airport you can see the Mandalay Bay hotel straight away and it is huge! The hotel has a very impressive loby and it will take you about a week to find everything. On arrival we asked for a strip view room with we had......room 29231. What a view it was too. We were on the 29th floor (in the heavens basically) and we had a cracking view of the strip. The only thing that bothered me was the lift. Our lift on served floors 19-33 and it moved so fast I had motion sickness the whole time I was there....in fact the sickness didnt go away until 3 days after we landed home! The rooms are very spacious and recently renovated...they have done a superb job. My partner spent most of the holiday in the extra large bath....he thought it was great. Some people dont like the location of the hotel because it is at the end of the strip but there is a free momorail running from the Mandalay Bay to the Excalibur and then all you have to do is walk accross the walk way over to the MGM Grand and catch the other monorail to where you want to go. You can buy an all day pass for just $9 which is great...the best ticket to buy because 1 way is about $4. Sharks Reef is an awesome place to visit if you like fish, we have a marine tank at home so we found it very fascinating. I have to say our time in Las Vegas passed very quickly and although I wouldnt go back, I was very sorry to leave. The jet lag I suffered ruined me the whole time I was there because I made the mistake of going to bed as soon as I arrived at resort and that is not a good thing to do. I was on british time the whole time I was there which meant I was in bed by 7pm Las Vegas time and up like a button at 3 in the morning. If your looking for somewhere cheat to eat you have to try Panda Epress, cracking chinese food at an amazing price."

Only thing...I desperately need coffee in the morning, while getting ready for the day. There is a Starbuck's within the hotel property, but about a 10 minute walk. Tried to get coffee through room service, but the wait was over 60 minutes!! Why can't there be a coffee maker in the room??? Other than that, no complaints. I liked being at the end of the strip. A cab ride to anywhere was never over $22, and it took just minutes to get to downtown and to the outlying hotels."

Being at the southern end of the strip is a benefit, the crowds are less and the surroundings are great. A little effort is needed to get to up the strip but the walk is great throug the casinos and the monorail is very modern and efficient (although it is always a long walk from the stations as they are mostly at the rear of the properties). You are even close to an outlet mall, what more could you want! I have one gripe though, can someone please maintain the elevators better? Overall a fantastic venue."

Check in was chaotic and took far too long. On the same property are The Four Seasons and The Hotel and, apart form the distance involved in walking from one to another, either of these is far better. However for location and character my recomendation would be the Venetian and for value Treasure Island."

    "content": "We just returned from a 4 night stay at the Mandalay Bay - our check-in experience was great - no waiting, as easy as could be! Our room was lovely - the hotel is a bit modern on the masculine side but beautiful. Great room. Larger than usual, great bathroom (flat panel tv in the bath, great shower, double sinks) beds were very comfortable....got in late the first nite so we went to bed - not sure how this hotel ever passed as building code - the noise was awful! The doors slam each time you close them so each time someone entered or left a nearby room, we heard the slamming. Also, the bathroom doors (double doors) don't have a standard knob - they the kind of closure that you have to pull and it kind of snaps closed...yup, makes a loud noise! Not a bother during the day but if your partner goes to the bathroom in the middle of the nite, you hear it! Also, don't take a room facing the pool - you hear the planes landing and taking off! We spoke with other people who also complained about the noise level in their rooms....We were in a wing that had 8 elevators - this hotel is huge, 8 elevators one would think would be enough - during the weekdays it was fine but once the weekend came we had to wait 20 minutes to get one! There would be a line for the elevators! Come on, this is a major hotel - one elevator was out of service the entire time we were there (4 nites!) Everyone was shocked that this would happen - and it was all day and night!!! We finally figured out that you had to hop into an elevator going up (if you could fit in, everyone figured this out!), ride it up and then down, usually stopping at each floor both ways! This was nuts!! You tried to make your trips to the room as infrequent as you could! We ate at Lupo, Wolfgang Pucks restaurant in the Mandalay - it was awesome! The staff was great and friendly, the food was amazing! We loved it. Also, we had our 10 year old with us. They don't publish it, but they have a kids menu that is great (the usual) - just ask if your waiter doesn't tell you - The hotel is at the southern end of the strip - Not sure if we would stay there again - I think staying in the middle of the strip is a better location and this hotel doesn't have that much to offer to make you want to stay there. Their big thing is the pool area, so if its pool weather, consider it. If not (it was in the 30's-50's when we were there) consider other hotels."

Our room was quiet, clean, spacious, and comfortable. Everything in the room worked perfectly for our entire stay. The large flat-screen TV, two sinks in the bathroom, a large deep sunken bathtub and a separate stall shower were nice touches. The staff was friendly and unobtrusive. We felt that the prices in the restaurants in the hotel were on the high side for the area, but there is easy access to the Luxor and Excaliber, where the restaurant prices are somewhat lower. We had some difficulty finding a parking spot in the hotel parking garage on returning early Saturday evening (about 5pm). There was a terrible traffic jam outside the garage, and very few spaces left inside. If I had that to do over, I wouldn't move the car out of the garage on Saturday. Other than that, our stay at this hotel was a pleasant experience, and I'd definitely stay there again."

Would have been really nice if it had not been so cold and raining but it is the end of Nov.. There was still one pool open and we did see a few people taking a dip.. just a little to cool for my blood. The beds were comfy.. room was clean and well kept.. The hotel is self was clean and nicely decorated for the holiday. The staff was extremely friendly. It was our 3rd wedding anniversary.. I advised the person when the reservation was made that this was going to be our anniversary trip...on our second night we returned to our room to find a nice bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries... definetely a nice touch.. I have not been to Vegas in about four years.. and had no clue they had converted all of the slot machines so that they do not accept coins.. it's normally my routine/ritual to collect all of my spare coins to start my gambling (don't ask me why.. just something I've always done...... so it was a little disapppointing.. the automated coin sounds took a little of the excitement out of it for me... and I'm sure the fact that I did not get too start off with my usual ritual had something to do with the fact that I won NOTHING :>)!! I have to blame it on something right.. The one and only bad thing I can say about the hotel itself.. The dinner buffet was HORRIBLE.. Now this is just myself and my husband OPINION... but there is really not one good thing I can say about the buffet..my husband is a very simple man when it comes to food and he is really not interested in some of the finer dining options... give him a burger, steak or seafood and he is a happy camper...We decided on the buffet thinking with such a large selection we could both find something we were happy with.. I can not express how disappointing this experience was... Everything looked so appealing and good....but this could not have been further from the truth.. we found the food to be VERY bland.. everything sort of taste the same.. after fixing multiple plates trying to find something that taste good.. we both just gave up.. I ended up filling up on crab legs..which you can't really get wrong.. My husband then decided to try some desserts.. within the first bite...his expression told the story.. not wanting to beleive that this nearly $60 dinner buffet could be that bad... I went and got an assortment of desserts and found that they were all HORRIBLE.. the cakes were dried out.. everything had a taste as if it had been sitting in a freezer uncovered and then thawed and servered.. YUCK..... The only other hotel restaurant that we tried was the Burger Bar which was really tasty... I will definitely stay at MB again.. hopefully during the warmer months to take advantage of the awesome pools.."

    "content": "This is my second stay in the Mandalay hotel rooms. I've stayed at THEHotel as well. Since my last stay, the standard rooms have been substantially upgraded with a big plasma TV and another small LCD TV in the bathroom. I love the new design. The room is spacious with floor to ceiling window, IPod clock/radio player, a sleek look, comfortable pillowtop mattress and fairly sizeable. It was very comfortable and pleasant. This hotel may have the best selection of restaurants of any in Vegas. There are way too many to count. We liked rumjungle for drinks and appetizers, THECafe at THEHotel for lunch (amazing lobster cobb salad!), Mix (also at THEHotel on the 69th floor) for an upscale dinner--the menu is heavy on fish selections. Each of the three in my party ordered a different fish entree and each was delicious and expertly cooked. The 24 hour cafe, Raffles, is great for breakfast or a late night grilled cheese sandwich. A couple of Starbucks outlets are also nice for us addicts. I had a terrific massage at the Mandalay spa which is smaller than Bellagio's but well-appointed and easy to navigate. MB isn't in the most central place on the strip but if you don't mind walking, it is accessible to a lot of other properties. As much as I really like the accommodations and the great restaurant and bar selection at Mandalay, I'm not too crazy about the casino. For video poker gamblers the pickings are slim, and pay tables are crummy. At night the casino is cacaphonously loud. There is a House of Blues, a dance place in the center of the casino, and another one at the entrance to the restaurant walk area. At times, loud base heavy dance music emanated from all 3 venues at the same time, along with piped in music overhead in the casino. Imagine being surrounded by four different stereos playing four different dance songs at the same time at a loud volume. On Sunday night I couldn't take it anymore and I'd say that many others must have felt the same way, because despite the fact that the hotel seemed to be pretty well occupied, the casino was pretty deserted by the time all the music started. They really need to do something about the sound situation in the casino. Other than that, we loved the place and will probably return every year about this time."

    "content": "My husband was in town for a convention at Mandalay Bay from Nov 3-10. I joined him and was pleasantly surprised by our stay. We've been to Vegas multiple times and were always hesitant to stay anywhere other than the central Strip area (Flamingo, Bills, etc). Mandalay is not as inconvenient as one would think, with the handy tram between Excalibur and Mandalay...and the monorail at MGM. I cannot count how many times we took the tram and monorail this week, but I can honestly say that we didn't dread the hike between destinations. Our room rate was the convention rate, which I know is much lower than if we'd booked ourselves, and it was worth the price. I'm not sure if I'd pay $300 a night, but I do have to say the hotel is lovely. Our room was cleaned daily by friendly housekeepers (who don't necessarily kick you out to clean) and the beds are so soft and comfortable. The TV station selection is very limited, but plenty of news stations available (for the OJ coverage of course!). Internet is $12.99 per day PER laptop. The minibar does have a sensor on all things in it, if you pick it up, you will be charged immediately. My husband had a $8.72 mini bottle of gin and the bottled water was $4.85 for an almost 24 oz bottle. The waitstaff at Raffles is extremely slow and most do not speak English well. We waited 30 minutes for our server to come back at the end of the meal with our ticket split, because he could not understand and then he disappeared. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet, but it's really not worth $15.99 per person M-Sat. The Red White and Blue cafe has some of the best spagetti and meatballs I've ever had, I highly suggest it. I was a bit disappointed that none of the shops really carry much for medicine/bandages. The Flamingo gift shop is fantastic as they carry so many things, but I was unable to find anything for blistered feet anywhere in Mandalay Bay. The Walgreens down the street is very expensive, but at least carries the majority of things you might need that you didn't pack. I used the Spa for a pedicure, it was very relaxing and the staff was very professional. The pool was great for relaxing and reading a book, but the music is a bit loud (as other's have commented). We ate at NYNY most of the time, because they have the best variety of food down on that end of the Strip. We went to the Ultimate Game Show at the Hilton, it's a great time, highly suggested. They pulled my number and I was a contestant for the \"Name that Tune\" segment, and Chuck Woolery was our host that day. If you're looking for an afternoon show, I highly suggest it! We also saw Rodney Carrington at MGM, and it was a good show as well. We wanted to see Howie Mandel, but we were just too tired after 5-6 days out in Vegas. If you can get a good deal for Mandalay, take it, but if you're looking to save money, this would not be the hotel for you."

    "content": "I stayed at the Mandalay Bay with my mum for a week. We were awe struck with the luxury of the room. No problems checking in (apart from the fact we walked through the casino to' the hotel' Mandaly Bay - not realising it was a different hotel). The room had two queensized beds which were so comfortable - we looked forward to going to bed each night as they had a mattress topper on them. The bathrrom was fab. The view was of the airstrip and although sounds awful was great as we had a view of all the mountains in the distance. I especially liked the ceiling to floor windows which were amazing. My mum was a bit scared of going too close, but I loved the view and it made the room seem lovely and bright. There was a flat screen huge television, although american TV is crap! . We were on floor 27 which was fab! The pools were amazing, but I would agree with some of the comments about the music. At first we thought it was good, but as the week went on it did get irritatating as it was so loud! I enjoyed breakfast at the house of blues as I found Raffles a bit stuffy and the staff were much friendlier at HoB. There is a handy tram at the hotel that runs to Luxor and Excalibor. Dont have the buffet dinner at the Excalibor as it is a bit dark and dismilll and the staff loiter for tips. I didnt really enjoy any of the buffet dinners from the hotels. Tried the Luxor - definately don't do breakfast there as it is chaotic! The Deuce bus outside the hotel takes you down the whole strip for 5 dollars (24 hour use). But if you are going to Fremont street take a taxi (21dollars one way from mandaly bay) as it took 1 and half hours on the bus due to the busy traffic. It only takes 10 minutes by taxi. I would definately stay at the Mandalay Bay again - terrific. I know some people did not like the location but I loved it as you could get away from some of the hustle and bustle that ocurs further down the strip. Take plenty dollar bills for tips as it gets habitual!!!"

    "content": "I stayed at the Mandalay Bay last month and I was honestly disappointed by the service. We checked into our first room and the air conditioner was broken. It was rather hot in there and it was making a loud whirring noise that was very annoying. A call down to the front desk about the problem was met with attitude from the woman on the phone, but a quick room change. I will give them credit for how fast the bellhop was up to move us to the new room. A few days went by without incident, but then one night we were in the casino and recieved extremely poor service from the waitstaff. After an hour and a half at one machine we still had not had a waitress come by to take a drink order. They were serving people around us and no matter how hard we tried we could not flag one down. We finally decided to leave our lucky machines to go to the bar in the sports betting area and didn't have much better luck. We stood there for around 20 minutes while the bartender helped everyone around us, including people who had not been waiting at all. I was highly disappointed by this service in a 4 star hotel. (For the record we received incredible service in every other casino we went to in town but most notably at the Rio. That is where I will be staying next time.) The next day we went down to the concierge desk to see who we could speak to regarding the problem the night before. She was perhaps the most rude person I have ever encountered in my life. Her attitude was appaling. I thought that at least being polite to customers who are polite to her was a part of her job description but I guess I was wrong. We were finally able to speak to a manager who couldn't seem to care less about the rudeness of the staff. Then the day we were checking out we took our luggage to the bellhop in the valet area to hold for us until it was time to go to the airport and he refused to put our luggage on the cart, he made us do it ourselves. Keep in mind that he did it for the people in line in front of us and the people in front of them. It seems that everyone on the staff that we encountered had an attitude problem and didn't want to be doing their jobs. I was extremely disappointed. The grounds of the hotel were extremely beautiful and the rooms were very comfortable. The lazy river was so much fun. But due to the staff I will never be returning to the Mandalay Bay."

Only issue was that the shower handle was missing when we checked so phoned maintenance and by the time we'd returned to the room that night it was replaced - no further problems. The beach pool area is ace - busy but plenty of sun loungers at all times of the day. Food - We ate in Giorgio's Italian and the burger place both in the Mandalay Mall between that hotel and sister hotel next door (Egyptian-themed Luxor). Food and service were fantastic! The Mix bar at THEHotel has fantastic views of the Strip and great cocktails - its free to get in before 9. Massive queues for the clubs Rumjungle and House of Blues -you have to queue even being a resident! Hotel is at the far end of the Strip - get the free monorail from MB to it's sister hotels to cut down the walk a bit. Ask for a Strip view hotel room when you check in for an amazing view! We asked and had the choice of two rooms (either double or two queen beds) when we asked. We got a Strip view and it's floor-ceiling glass overlooking all the sights - breathtaking! The room was superb, large comfy bed with Egyptian cotton sheets, big plasma TV, large bathroom with two sinks, jacuzzi style bath, separate walk in shower and separate toilet room. This was just a standard room booked!"

    "content": "We arrived on Tuesday, the 9th, at noon. Check-in was some what quick, tried the $20.00 trick for complimentary upgrade, and all she could do is upgrade for a extra charge. We declined, we already were being charged $215.00 a night per night and that was the convention rate for a standard room. She was able to get us a 27th floor with dead center view of strip, which at night is gorgeous! When we got to the room we realized we had 2 queens, I guess I didn't here that part when she offered the view room. We were a little early anyway, and while the room was being cleaned she told us that we could drop off the luggage which was a carry on. The room looks brand new and everything is very comfortable and clean. Went down stairs to the restaurant at the pool to check things out and have lunch. Husband was getting cranky, he hates when I try to rearrange things, but I feel that you have to ask, and the worst they can say is no. Restaurant was so so. They have a walk up window next to eating area that you can order food and take to there little area or to the pool. Went to check in for convention, husband went to seminar and I to the pool. The walking around this hotel is tiring so bring good shoes, but with so many ameneties and convention center on site I new it would be like this. So feeling guilt going to the the Bayside Buffet was no problem. And it was good, especially the chilled and steamed crab. The Mandalay Spa is a must, and even if you don't go for a massage or anything go for the relaxation. Lots to enjoy! They do take the daily spa fee off if you make an appt of $50 or 60.00. And on this trip I had a 2 appts and they had a special of 20% off the second. Also liked that spa and pool entrance are right off the elevators. The rest of our trip of 3 nights was husband going to seminars, me at there fabulous pools, no crowds! And gambling! The first 2 nights it was kinda slow in the casino, the vibe wasn't there, but it picks up on Thursday toward the weekend. Spent the whole time at the hotel, have done all the tourist stuff in the past, it was nice to get away and indulge in such a fabulous hotel. Will be coming back!"

    "content": "We stayed 3 nights at \"THE hotel\" and then the next three at Mandalay Bay. We got a conference rate and I felt our experience was on par with what we paid. I liked this hotel better than \"THE Hotel\". It was nicely decorated both in the rooms and in the public areas. I have sections below for staff, rooms, pool, spa, etc. If you like spas, be sure to read that part! Check-in and staff: Everyone we encountered was very helpful, with bags, with transition from the other hotel to Mandalay, etc. Rooms: The rooms are plenty large and the closet space is more than adequate. There is a flat screen TV on the wall in front of the bed. Beds are comfy and they provided four nice pillows. However, they are down, and I got scratched a few times by feather quills sticking out. There was a featherbed on the bed, very comfy! There were no robes....not sure if we got skimped on that or if they just don't provide them. I meant to ask, but I was too busy hanging out in the spa. The bathroom had two sinks and plenty of vanity space for my husband and I to spread out all of our stuff. There is a separate shower and a nice, large tub that fills up REALLY fast! The toilet is in a separate \"closet\" so that makes sharing a bathroom easier. The entire room was very clean and light and nicely decorated. Comparing it to \"THE hotel\", if I had it to do over again, I would stay only at Mandalay, because while the rooms aren't suites, they are still large and have a nice TV. The only problem was that the hinges on the door to the toilet made an awful creaking, noise. It was pretty loud, not just a little squeek. I never called to get it fixed because we weren't in the room that much. However, this is the kind of detail I look for in a hotel....the maid has to clean the toilet, and therefore must open the door, and therefore must have heard the noise, but didn't do anything about it. I expected better, but it was a small inconvenience. Casino: We don't really gamble, so I can't comment, other than to say that somehow this one is not nearly as smoky as others! Restaurants: We ate breakfast both at Raffles Cafe and at the buffet. Don't let the lines fool you...they manipulate that during the day, I guess trying to make Raffles look busy. You may have to wait a few minutes, but they have tons of tables. They just bring everyone in with a sort of \"process\" that takes more time and causes there to always be a line out front. The service is nice, but the breakfast food is pretty standard and a bit pricey, as with all hotels. The buffet was decent quality as far as buffets go, and for about the same price as an entree and OJ at Raffles, you can go to the buffet and partake of many different things. Pool/Beach: The \"beach\" area, as they call it, has a lazy river, wave pool, a few \"normal\" pools and several hot tubs. The \"beach\" part means that they brought in sand. However, they then set wall to wall deck chairs on it. So, you can't really walk in the sand, but you can lie on a deck chair on sand. The wave pool is fun, but you cannot bring anything to float on. They rent tubes for the lazy river, but they are expensive. Walgreens, down the street, has small ones for $3 each which are perfectly fine. Even though the pool area is open until 6, at 5:30, they shut off the hot tub jets, the river current and the wave pool and start hustling people out. There are a few areas with shade, but not many. You can rent a cabana for $200, ouch! If you want shade, get there early and understand that no one location will be shaded all day, except a cabana. The best area, IMHO, is to go around to the \"back side\" of the lazy river. It's shaded most of the day and remote, so, you will not have people shuffling by you all day. Also, the \"white noise\" of the waterfall drowns out the other noises. However, you can't really relax since there is music playing constantly. Waitresses serve expensive drinks, or there are bars. Food is basically burgers from a heat lamp served with your lettuce, etc. in a plastic bag. It was fun to go in the wave pool and lazy river, but if you want a relaxing beach or pool experience and/or to sit by the pool or on a beach and enjoy drinks, go to an all-inclusive in Mexico! Spa: The Spa Mandalay is one of the best I have ever been to and I am a spa junkie. If you book even one treatment, you can spend all day relaxing in there. As in the pictures, there is a \"water area\" with hot, warm and cold pools. This is what you see in the photos with the rust-colored tiles and fish fountains. This is surrounded by nice deck chairs with cushions (SO comfortable). There is a steam sauna with eucalyptus and a dry sauna. So, before and/or after your treatment, you can sit here and listen to the waterfall, go in the hot, warm or cold pools, take a steam or sauna, etc. Water, coffee, hot tea, and fruit juice are provided as well as snacks such as muffins, nuts, and fruit. In addition to the water area, there is a TV lounge with couches and chairs and a \"quiet\" lounge, with no TV. Locker room is nice, as are shower areas and vanity areas. They provide iced washrags and cucumber slices in ice water, if you want to lay down with those things on your eyes. Treatments: I got an orange peel scrub combined with a cocoa butter steam wrap. Both are really nice and I loved the way I smelled afterward! I also had the best massage ever from MERLY. She is a sweet lady and doesn't just give you a relaxing little rub-down....she works hard, using reiki and several different massage techniques to help any problem spots you have. I felt she had a true healing touch, in addition to being a skilled therapist. I liked it so much, I went back for a second massage the next day! If that sounds good to you, consider requesting her. The only drawbacks....the staff have to wheel carts around to collect towels and things, so when they do that, it's loud. However, they have to do this some time. Also, I think the girls in charge of cleaning the showers and stocking them with towels were gossiping in the back more than working, because once the showers were all used, it took a while for them to be cleaned and stocked again. I think it's just hard to hire good help anymore! Overall, I liked most things about Mandalay Bay and would consider staying here again. However, I think they could really improve things such as the creaking hinges and it's too bad they think everyone comes to the pool to party and listen to loud music. If I went back, it would be for the spa!"

    "content": "This was a business trip for us, and so I didn't have a choice in hotels, but I also didn't have to pay for the hotel. I find myself not being quite as critical in these situations, but I am aware that the Mandalay Bay is not an inexpensive option. We checked in at about noon on a Saturday and checkin was speedy and pleasant, and we were surprised to hear that our room was ready. We hadn't brought our luggage in from our car in the parking garage because we thought we wouldn't be able to check all the way in. The parking garage is a pretty good distance away from the hotel's elevators to the rooms. You have to walk through the casino (of course) then past quite a few restaurants to get to the garage. The room was very nice - nicely appointed and made us feel relaxed. This was the ONLY relaxation we got from our trip, so it was nice. We were very comfortable in the room, although the bed had some type of feather mattress topper on it, and though it was cozy, it was kind of odd to have to sleep in the indentations all the prior guests bodies had made - kind of like trying to sleep in a hammock. We really didn't know what to make of it. But you're so tired in Vegas all the time, it really didn't hamper our sleep. The bathroom is fantastically appointed and has a luxurious feel to it. The room at the Mandalay Bay was the highlight of our trip. We are not Vegas fans, so being here is difficult, and it was great to have this escape away from all the gambling, drinking and smoke. However, the restaurants seemed to be hit and miss. We ate at the Bay Side Buffet for dinner one evening and though it was more than $25 per person, it was the most horrific buffet we've ever had. The food was absolutely awful. Almost any other buffet on the planet would be a better choice than this one. I would say avoid the dinner buffet at all costs! The Raffles cafe was really good for breakfast, on the other hand. The pancakes were divine! And my husband ate at Noodles and nothing but good things to report. If you are attending an event at the Convention Center attached to the Mandalay Bay, staying here is a MUST. You will regret it if you make another choice. Vegas just wears you out and it's a great convenience to be able to get to your room from a somewhat reasonable walk."

I was very surprised when I got much more than I expected. First I wanted a double bed room, non smoking and a view of the strip. I got all that and a brand new remodeled suite. The room was the very best one I ever stayed in after being in Vegas more than 25 times and traveling all over this country and many overseas countries. If the hotel really had all the problems the older reviews spoke about, then MGM has done a fantastic job in a very short time. I stayed in #28-104 and would recommend it to anyone. The bathroom was also far above normal and I wish I had stayed here before I built my new home because I would have incorporated many of the things this room has. JP Albany, N.Y."

The casino and lobby area smells good and doesn't have the stale, smoky smell that a lot of other casinos have. Mandalay Bay has a lot of great restaurants and decent shopping. Unfortunately, it's on one end of the Strip so walking anywhere is a bit of a hike. Unfortunately, I didn't get to the pool area, though it looked fabulous. Don't plan to go to the fitness center while there unless you want to pay the $27/daily Spa fee."

We got an Orbitz package for $700 pp which inlcluded roundtrip airfare from Hawaii and 4 nights (over a weekend!). This was a steal for Mandalay in May. Airfare from HI alone can cost that. Loved the TVs. Especially watching the TV while enjoying a soak in the bathtub big enough for 2! Tip: bring some bubble bath! We had to get the remote fixed for the big one, but they brought a new remote in no time. Lots of closet space for 2, each with own closet. Noise was never an issue, which we were a bit worried about in Vegas. The bed was very comfy, but the feathers poking out of the pillows were an itchy issue. The hotel was clean, beautiful, and the pool area is always crowded but worth it - it's a great way to spend the afternoon! Lots of pools, hot tubs, etc. Even when it's packed, y ou can carve out your own little spot somewhere. Location is a little annoying. Takes quite a bit of a walk to get to mid-Strip. We ended up mostly staying in the South Strip area. Ended up having to take a cab to go up to Wynn to see Le Reve. If you have the time and are walking the strip, you can sometimes jump on the Deuce for a quick $2 ride and avoid the walk back. We usually would walk home but jump on it if we saw it coming by. Being connected to Luxor and Excalibur was convenient when you wanted to get a $6 breakfast or lunch instead of going to a pricy Mandalay restaurant. I HIGHLY recommend grabbing lunch on the cheap at the Giorgio Caffe in Mandalay Place. For $7 you can have a great lunch portion of the wonderful food of the main restaurant next door. Don't bother going to the sit-down restaurant, hit up the cafe. Went back twice. Rum Jungle was worth it for the Mongolian buffet. Would go back in a heartbeat if I could get the same deal!"

The next day we went out shopping that morning and came back to room only to find that our keys had been deactivated. Of course this was another journey to the front desk. We had two keys,one of which hadn't even been out of the pouch they give you but we were told that is was our fault because we had carried it against something that had deactivated them. We then go to the pool to find out about the $14.00 pina coladas and as I pay with the room credit card I noticed it had someone else's name on it. So does this mean someone is carrying around my room charge key to have anything they want? Another trip to the front desk! I explained after 3 afternoons at the front desk could we at least be compensated with a free breakfast or comped anything? I was told no because we had got a room with a view.

The BEST part about Mandalay Bay is SPA MANDALAY. It's huge, beautiful and has great people there. I had a massage by WENDY BERKOWITZ and it was the best massage I've had in 30 years!!! She intuitively knew to adjust the pressure to deeper or lighter, without me saying a word. I just wish they still had Yoga at the beach & also that they would offer some new therapies in the spa, like Thai massage, Ashiatsu, Reiki, SOMETHING! But overall, it's completely underpriced for what you get & is incredibly beautiful & relaxing. What more could you want???"

Pros: Big *clean* resort Fast check-in (at 11:00pm on a Monday) Mostly non-smoking areas throughout the resort Nicely renovated room (\"Honeymoon\" suite, though not different from any other suite) Good view of the strip (from our room, as with most Vegas hotels, strip view is a gamble...) Fabulous bed! Down comorters, feather bed topper, feather pillows. Pool facility so big we couldn't cover it all! Liquor store across the street (we're total boozehounds, our room is the place to catch a mean cocktail) Cons: Casino is tight, played (tables & slots) more than usual and won zero. Smoking room reservation was not fulfilled, even though it had been confirmed earlier the same day (smoked in room anyways, can't tell me what to do on my own honeymoon!) Only one restaurant open after 11pm, hello...Vegas is 24 hours?! yea, right. Children in the casino?! [--]? Wierd. Location is far-far-far from everthing else (we knew that though, just really hit when we got there). Cabanas are freakin' expensive, although the shade was great & the fact that we didn't have to scout chairs at 9:00am Security barged in one evening during my nap, \"To see if we were OK\" , [--], knock first! Fee to use the gym, my husband was a bit irked about that. In conclusion: We did enjoy our stay for the most part. I was really riled by the security guard thing- of course we're OK, don't you see all the crap being charged to our room from all over the resort; obviously we've been quite busy using the amenities!! This hotel is quite large & very beautiful; I loved the tropical theme being an island girl in California. There wasn't a spot of dirt anywhere, and you never see staff cleaning public areas. I'd recommend this hotel to people who don't necessarily want to hit all the hotspots, unless you have a private car & driver (not a hot stinky cab with a crazy-ass cab driver; speed limit?-whatever!). Oh, lastly, check to see waht type of conventions are being held during your stay; the week that we were there was the 'Gentleman's Club Owners Expo' = more fake hair, breasts & nails than usual (yes, even for Vegas) and less clothes. The place was crawling, quite literally, with 'entertainers' and the creeps that employ them. Ewww."

Some of the other hotels we visited were so busy we couldn't wait to get out of them! We stayed in a Parlor Suite - it was pure heaven, with the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in. The decor was to a very high standard, and the views superb. We ate in the noodle bar, House of Blues and Fleur de Lys and all were superb. The beach and pool are great, although it was almost too hot to sunbathe when we were there. We had a trip around Shark Reef which was also very good, although the queue was rather long at 3.00pm. Overall we had an amazing time and would highly recommend it to anyone. Only outdone by Ceasars and the Belagio!"

The doormen that greeted us were friendly and headed us in the right direction to check in. We entered the resort and couldn't help but admire the smell that so many people dislike! It is a very clean flowery smell. Once we made it to the lobby, we were checked in in a matter of minutes. I asked if I could get a room with a view and the attendant said she would do her best. When we got to our room we had a beautiful view from the 16th floor looking out onto the swimming pools and down Las Vegas Blvd heading opposite the strip. Our room was adequate size with a nice touch of plasma tv's in the main room and bathroom! The room was also very clean. We used a couple of the ten percent off coupons at the Chocolate store and the Burger Bar in the shops that connect Mandalay and the Luxor. Both of those places were awesome. I also took advantage of the free swing analysis at the Nike Golf Store that comes with the Mandalay coupon book. They actually videotape you and are very conscientious and helpful. We purchased two tickets to Mama Mia! at the box office, again using the Summer Splash promotion that Mandalay is promoting, and got two for one tickets. Fourth row, sold out, awesome show! We ate at the cafe once for breakfast which was good and also at the blues club, which wasn't. The casino is nicely lit and the poker room, although small, is nice. Overall our experience was superior, comparable to the Venetian, but the rooms, although nice, don't compare. We would highly recommend this resort."

All the rooms have undergone a refit and are decorated in a modern and trendy style, the bedroom has large flat screen TV on the wall, and a smaller LCD TV in the bathroom. The beds are large and very comfortable one of the best beds we have slept on. The hotel seemed to attracted the young and trendy which was good, one of the reasons we chose this Hotel was the wave pool, as we came as a family with our teenage son and his friend, they loved it. and the lazy river,at the front of the wave pool it has sand which gives you the feel as if you are on a real beach. just close your eyes and it really feels like you are on the beach with the crasing waves. the sand can get very hot under bare feet, so wearing sandals is a good idea. the only down side is that there is no shade so have to go in the pool to cool off. We tried one of the restaurants in the hotel which I would recommend the Burger Bar which is located in Mandalay Bay shopping mall which has a sports theme. The hotel is located at the southern end of the strip which is away from the buzz of the centre of the strip, but the hotel makes up for it. There is a free mono rail which takes you to the Excalibur, from there just use the walkway across to the NewYork New York, and you are near the heart off the action. a cheap alternitive to taxi's is to use the Deuce bus service which runs the complete length of the strip, an all access pass costs $5 , and last for 24 hours and give's you unlimited travel. I would recommend this hotel for family and couples and would stay here again"

The bad things are that they charge $15 to use the business center, and they also charge $15 a day to have a fridge in the room. They don't have very many family dining options, most restaurants are very trendy and expensive. The pastries at Starbucks there were terrible, the worst we've ever had at a Starbucks. The parking structure is a VERY long walk to the elevators, so make sure you use the bell hop in the front. They have a poolside cafe, which was convenient.

It was crowded, dirty and the service was horrible and rude rude rude. Never again!! To begin with, our non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor was filled with smoke. During our 4 day stay we realized that the smoking policy is only on paper, people smoked everywhere, including in the restaurants. Then, the linen in our rooms (3 of them) was filthy. The sheets were grey with dark streaks on them. One sheet had suspicious rust coloured stains. The pillows were itchy, with feathers coming out. Really bizarre. Worse - when we asked for housekeeping to change the linen, we were woken after midnight when the cleaning woman knocked on our door. The next day the cleaning woman simply refused to change the sheets (\"not my problem\" she said to us). Outside of the rooms, the hotel was filled beyond capacity, going up and down from the room to the pool could take 15-20 minutes, as elevators full of people that simply couldnt take another occupant went by. Everwhere else there were impossible queues - want to talk to the concierge? wait 20 minutes. Coffee? the same. An ice-cream? sure...but with lines from here to eternity, inefficient staff, a till that never worked, you could never charge the room. It was a nightmare. Our room keys didnt work from one day to the next and we would spend hours every day going up - going down - waiting in line - getting new keys......and again and again every day.....The pool was crowded beyond belief. It opened at 08:00, but if you came at 09:00 there was nowhere to sit. The only shade available were cabanas that you needed to pay for (200-400$ per day!!!!!) When we called the shift manager to complain, he was extremely rude, telling us that if we dont like it, it is fine with him, as the hotel is very popular. When we suggested it might not be so popular in the future considering the level of hospitality, we were told: \"that is your opinion\". Overall it was a vacation from hell and we will never go there again."

Just a few complaints - Hotel far away from other action on the strip, took a lot of taxis. Hallway carpeting dirty and stained on our floor. Otherwise it was a fun Hotel to stay at and our teenage kids really enjoyed it. I know it's a 4 star hotel but don't expect 4 star service in any of these Vegas mega resorts.

    "content": "I've stayed at a few of the more affordable Hotels over the years, Including Treasure Island, Flamingo, Excalibur, Luxor, and now I must say putting in an extra hundred $ a person for a nice hotel like Mandalay Bay was a great choice. We had a wedding to attend at the Bellagio and didn't want to spend a $1000 per/person for the trip so We picked MB because of the pool, the new rooms, and most of all it was only $100 more than Luxor. So we arrived at 11 in the morning on a weds, got through the line within 15 min. The room itself was great, Huge plasma, and plasma in bathroom. Comfortable beds, and his and her closets. we found out the first day that if you even take out a drink from the mini fridge provided by the hotel that you will get billed. We took 2 waters out (costing $4 each) and put our own in... only to find out the next day that the fridge has an auto lock on it so they can bill you each day for what you used. We left a note for the maid and she replied back that she had replaced the water and would not be billed. (very nice) The pool simply kicked major A$$. lots of fun, (too many kids in the lazy river) If you can buy your own tubes so you dont have to spend the $20 a day, they have no problem with bringing in your own. By friday and saturday the pool was too busy to want to spend lots of time. Only had one complaint with the hotel, which was the joining rooms, the door seemed paper thin and we were woken up each morning to our roudy neighbors at 6am. I'm 24 so i know its vegas and partying is what we do, but at 6am....you should be resting for the next night. anyways good stay, liked the rooms, loved the pool, won $300 at the casino and new beach casino (the new beach casino which has about 8 blackjack tables, 1 craps, and one roulette was my favorite place to gamble anywhere. and i was amazed they had $10 minimum blackjack tables on a Thursday)So MB is a great place. Tip: Try to get a room without an adjoining door."

    "content": "hWe stay at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino 4-5 times a year and have been doing so for about 5 years now. We know it intimately, warts and all. Frankly, there are few warts. I've read complaints on this site and some others and I'm perplexed. Recently they did an extensive remodel in the regular Mandalay Bay. The Hotel at the Mandalay is quite nice as well and it's mostly populated with 30 somethings and under. We prefer the larger, Mandalay Bay Resort/Casino for our stays. Okay, the remodel-quite wonderful. The most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. The bathrooms get a 10. They're huge and contain a large walk in shower and jacuzzi tub big enough for two; plasma tv, separate commode. They're going somewhat green and feature energy saving bulbs. Rooms are quite generous in size. We generally stay in a suite and it's quite ample as well with all the amenities. The restaurants at the Mandalay are grand. Our favorite among the 23 restaurants are: Trattoria del Lupo, swank Italian food ala Woflgang Puck, Aureole, pricy but drop dead beautiful and delicious continental/California type quisine, Burger Bar - loud but the best burgers bar none. You get your choice of type of beef, type of bun and a host of add on's like lobster tail, Red Square features over a 100 vodkas and a kickin' atmosphere. The Spa, what can I say? It's divine and I go there in my mind when life is stressful. The services are pricy but what the heck. Sometimes you have to get pampered. The gambling is quite fun. Their floor is HUGE so one never feels cramped. We play slots and they're pretty loose much of the time. Free drinks flow. My only complaint is about all of Vegas. They do not have any serious recycling of all that trash. That needs to change if we're to help Mother Earth."

I do have to say if you want a good lounge chair, you have to go early. The Beach Bar and Grill has delicious food and excellent service. We also ate at the Border Grill which was good as well. Our rooms were very nice and clean. For as many people that are in and out of the hotel, it is very clean. Next time I go to Vegas, I will be sure to stay here again. Be careful with the refrigerator in the room because it is weight sensitive so if you pick a bottle up, they will charge your room. We made a mistake by taking everything out of the fridge so that we could put our stuff in their to keep cold. We found out at check-out that we were charged $120.00 for the items in the fridge. Thankfully, the staff understood and took the charges off our bill."

    "date": "August 16, 2007",
    "content": "We spent four days at the Mandalay Bay with our two children (9 and 12). This is a very large hotel with some definite pluses and minuses. Pluses: Pools, particularly Lazy River and Wave Pool: Great fun for kids, although the closing time of the pool area is an early 7:00 p.m. The early closing time seems to make this area more family-friendly, though, since you don't really see crowd that would bring the alcohol and rowdiness you might get after dark. Valet and Entry: Valet Service was quite quick; you can get to your room without walking through the Casino (and Casino cigarette smoke). It seemed that most of the guests had flown in, so few people had cars valet parked, most were taking taxis. Location: With traffic on \"The Strip\" being horrendous, it is relatively easy to get to Mandalay Bay since it is at the south end. There is a tram to Luxor and Excalibur, and it is near the Airport. Special Accomodations: The staff accommodated special needs with a fridge and microwave, we generally could not complain about the service (once we got help.) Beds/Noise: Comfortable beds and rooms were generally quiet, although our neighbors did not seem to be noisy. Minuses: Waits: There can be a rather long wait on hold for any hotel service, and long waits at times for the elevators. The taxi line was also extremely long at times. Room Amenities: You have to order room service for anything, including coffee or tea. The flat screen TV was nice but there were relatively few channels for such a large hotel. WiFi is expensive at $13/day (although on lower floors near windows you can pick it up for free.) Cost: Not only are rooms expensive, but food is very expensive in the hotel. If you want an inexpensive quick meal or snack, you mayl have to leave the hotel. Cleanliness: The room was dirty enough (dust and dirt) that we had to ask that it be cleaned again after we checked in. Air conditioning: Worked OK, once we set it at 60 degrees. Missing items in our room: The ice bucket, \"do not disturb\" sign, and some other small items were missing from the room at check-in. Had to call housekeeping, wait on hold, and have them brought. Check-In: Not unlike checking in at the airport for an overseas flight, with similar lines. I heard someone else had a wait to get into their room while it was being cleaned. This hotel seems to host very large conventions. Saw a long check-in line even at 11:00 p.m. They closed windows and kept the lines long, apparently. All-in-all, Mandalay Bay is a hotel with beautiful public areas, is rather expensive, and seems understaffed (from housekeeping, to the front desk). This was a fairly family-friendly hotel (until the late night hours), considering that we had a car and the option to go elsewhere to eat. If you will not use the pools extensively, I would recommend staying somewhere else. (The Venetian is a good pick.)"

Still, we think this is the epitome of all that's great about the better side of Vegas: immaculate room, no waiting at check in, friendly staff, stunning view. It's a do- as- you- please sort of place, too: conference delegates in sharp suits mingle with the t-shirts and cut-off jeans brigade nicely. Who cares...this is Las Vegas.There's a vibrant atmosphere about this incredible hotel. Go see for yourself!. Bet you like it!"

The rooms are excelent and are really comfortable. Room was cleaned each day and i think they call back once each day to check everything is ok. Don't pick up anything from the minibar as you will get charged for it and the items in there are quite expensive. The hotel was exremely busy at the weekend and there was a conention on whilst we were there but we didnt experience any problems.Las Vegas itself is an amazing place and i am sure anyone travelling here will have a brilliant holiday!

(they have a wave pool and a river you can float in). The casino was not smokey and the dealers were very friendly. The service was great. The only thing we were disappointed in was that the room did not have a coffee maker! It is expensive to eat there but the portions are large and the buffet had a large variety of food: mexican, chinese, crab legs, one of the best I'd say. I think it was around $21. The hotel is at the end of the strip but we just wanted to stay there and not venture anywhere else. We had the bigger room and it seemed huge and had a jacuzzi tub and a flat screen TV in the bathroom! All the staff we encountered at the Mandalay were very nice. We did try to go to the beach casino but there is a $50 cover charge for men and a $10 cover charge for women because it's topless. We passed on that one but if you don't want tan lines that's the place to go. So overall we had a wonderful stay and will go back again."

    "content": "My family and I just recently returned from a week long vacation to Vegas where we stayed at Mandalay Bay. The hotel was VERY nice. Check-in was not bad. We just happened to pick the wrong line, but once we got to the counter the lady was really nice and got us checked in fairly quickly. (It makes a difference if your not very demanding and pushy.) I asked her if all of the rooms were re-done and she said that all of them were except for floors 32 & 33. Our room was on the 21st floor. We had a beautiful view of the strip and a partial view of the runway at the airport. The 550 sq. ft. room (with 2 queen beds) was very nicely decorated. Unfortunately, our door didn't lock sometimes and it would randomly choose days that it didn't want to accept our room key which was very annoying. (A Bit of Advice: call the maid service and ask for extra pillows because the ones that come on the bed are cheap and the feathers come out and poke your face which is very uncomfortable. There is one extra pillow in the closet that is more comfortable.) The pool was only crowded on the weekends, but during the week there were a lot of open chairs. I recommend sitting by one of the smaller pools, though, instead of in the sand by the wave pool because the sand gets extremely hot! The lazy river, by the way, is fun to just walk around in or swim, so you don't HAVE to buy tubes. The casino was not smoky at all. It actually had a vanilla scent throughout it! The Shark Reef was so-so. I personally think they should lower the prices because it's nothing better than something at SeaWorld.But we were there during feeding time which was a plus. The only downside to the trip was that the hotel was at the end of Las Vegas Blvd. We walked about half-way down the strip to the Bellagio and decided we were way too tired so we bought monorail tickets (wich are a little expensive!) Getting to the monorail from MB is also time consuming. (We timed it: about 30 min!) In order to get there we took the Express Tram from MB to Excalibur then walked across the street to MGM Grand and walked through the casino, following the signs to the monorail. Like I said, very time consuming, so if you want to get down the strip faster I suggest taking a cab. The cab line during the day at MB was not very long, although at night it was much longer. (A LOT of cabs are lined up, though, so the line does move quickly.) Fares were between $10 and $12 to go down the strip (not including tip) and about $13 to go to the airport. We were there during a Wallgreens Convention so it was a little crowded but not too bad. All-in-all, GREAT trip! -Sorry it's so long! :)"

    "content": "I stayed at Mandalay Bay resort as a single female off for a relaxing spa holiday. Boy did I get that . . . and much much more. First off, being a single female teacher, I must say that in general, Mandalay Bay's prices would have been WAY too steep for me to stay there on my own. However, I booked under one of there special internet promotions called \"Summer Glow\" and was able to get my room for about $120 a night. This was still steep for me, but it also included two free spa passes, (which was about a $70 value), and since my main purpose in staying there was to check out their world- renowned beach property and spa, I thought overall it was worth sacrificing a bit of a steep price (for me). I must say that Mandalay Bay exceeded ALL my expectations for a Las Vegas resort, and I have stayed at many there, including The Bellagio. First off, my room was ENORMOUS! It had a two-sink bathroom, a full shower and a tub, as well as closet space. The bedroom was huge too, with couches, an enormous bed, and a top of the line flat screen TV. I had a gorgous view of the strip. I couldn't have been happier with my clean, beautiful room. Check in was swift, as I checked in on a Monday (the least busy time), and the lobby was gorgeous with a fish aquarium and atrium fountains located right next to registration. The beach area blew me away. The wave pool and lazy river were relaxing and spectacular, and I had no problem finding a lounge chair. (Oh, by the way, instead of renting a tube for the lazy river, check for discarded ones near the perimeter of the pool- saves you $20!) After beachcombing all day, I became ravenous and had an exquisite $15 lunch at the outside cafe that came with a huge burger and beer-battered fries. Yum! One thing I should add is that I did pay the $10 entry fee to check out the Moorea Beach Club at Mandalay Bay where topless tanning was permitted. ( I like the idea of no tan lines). Overall, I would say it is not worth the entry fee. Once inside I was greeted with many beautiful looking women with fake boobs lounging on chairs (hardly ever topless though) drinking really expensive drinks while flirting with muscle men to some deep base pop music. Be prepared to spend $12-$15 per alcoholic drink! Moorea Beach Club was clearly all about \"being seen\" and not relaxing, European style bathing. I think I was one out of three girls there who went topless, so it actually makes you feel sort of strange. I'd skip this next time. As for the resort itself, it is so large, and there is so much to do, I could easily spend a weekend there and not step one foot outside the resort. Every meal I had there was delicious, and the \"jungle-style\" decor and foliage is breathtaking. As for the Spa, it is the best I've been to in Vegas, hands down. For those interested, I will write an entire separate review on the spa. Oh, one more thing I might note- TheHotel is an entirely different section of Mandalay Bay and it is easy to get confused about where you are staying. TheHotel is designed with kitchenettes, etc, and Mandalay Bay Hotel is like a regular hotel. That was a bit confusing at first, and I kept finding myself gravitating toward TheHotel, only to find out that's not where I was staying! Overall, I am officially spoiled by Mandalay Bay. I would most certainly stay here again if I got the same deal as last time. I absolutely loved this resort and would recommend it to anyone."

Had room service, which was surprisingly delicious and very fast. Wave pool is big, but has rules about where you can stand - we spent most of our time by one of the other pools and the lazy river. $20 to rent a large inner tube, $16 to buy smaller - would suggest bringing your own and having them inflate for you. Hotel is furthest south and we found it to be less crowded and less smoky. To get around the strip, I would suggest taking the tram to the Excalibur, then crossing the street to take the monorail behind the Tropicana. (I think?) You have to pay for the monorail, but it has many stops along the strip. We had free tickets to Shark Reef - it was nice and had some pretty big sharks, but don't think we'd want to pay the full price, although it may be worth it if you have kids. Also ate at the Mexican restaurant by the pool - sat outside and stayed cool with the misters, and watched people float down the lazy river. Recommend the Watermelon Mojito, which was highly refreshing. Also, concierge will print your boarding pass for you, but they close at 9:00 pm. (Thanks to the gal who waited those extra few minutes at closing while we dashed to our room to get our confirmation number!!)"

There were no lines and a very courteous registration clerk. Since this was the weekend of our thirty-fifth anniversary, I asked if he would upgrade my room. This was the big fight weekend and it appears the house was sold-out. So, no luck on an upgrade. Upon arriving at our refurbished room on the 26th floor, I observed a beautiful 550 square foot room with up a very large upgraded HD flat panel TV screen mounted on the wall. The bathroom was most spacious with a private WC. We ate at the China Grill on Monday night, one of the better Chinese restaurants in MB. The food service and ambiance was like nothing we had ever seen before. The manager sent a special desert in honor of our anniversary. Expensive, but worth every penny. The only drawback I can see at this hotel is its location on the South end of the strip. We took cabs everywhere, including the Mirage and once to Caesar\u2019s Palace Forum shops. Some people like the location, but notwithstanding the tram to the Excalibur, it really is not a good starting point to start walking the Strip. Walked the strip Monday morning while my wife enjoyed a luxurious spa treatment. She said was the best she ever had. I walked to the Bellagio, and then took the Deuce ($2.00 fare) bus ride back to the MB. Stopped at the pool on Monday afternoon, but it was to hot to stay outside. MB is one of Vegas\u2019 mega hotels. There is plenty to keep one busy besides gambling, but you cannot avoid the casino."

The suite was spacious, with comfortable beds and luxurious bathrooms. There were two big disappointments though. One is that we did not get the suite that they show on the web site. It shows that one bedroom has two beds, and one has one bed. In our suite, each bedroom had one bed. The desk clerk was not very concerned and told us that it was the only one available. They did offer a rollaway bed and $100 credit. The second big disappointment was that two weeks before arrival, the hotel told me that there are no CD players, but there are ipod docking stations. As it turned out, the suite did have a CD player (but of course I didn\u2019t bring any CDs with me) and the ipod \u201cstation\u201d requires you to have your cord to plug between it and your ipod. The weirdest thing was that all of the light bulbs were unscrewed, so it took us a long time to get any lamps to turn on. I suppose that was the work of pranksters who had the room before us? Check-in went great. Thursday at 3:15 pm and we were checked in within 10 minutes. Watch the check-out though, especially on a Sunday. It\u2019s very hard to get a down elevator with your luggage. Allow yourself at least 20 minutes to retrieve your luggage at the bell-stand if you store it after check-out. We got to the pool at 8:30 or 9:00 am and got excellent seats. The lazy river was practically empty at that time. By 11 it was packed though. We brought our own inner tubes and the folks at the rental shop inflated them for us. The mix bar on the top of THEhotel is amazing. We got there around 7:30pm and had a few drinks (go for the pink goose!). At 10 pm it becomes bottle service only, so that\u2019s when we left. The views of the strip are gorgeous\u2014it was fascinating to watch evening turn into night and see all of the neon lights get brighter and brighter. The casino was nice, with slot machines starting at 1-cent and on up to several dollars. It wasn\u2019t very smoky and seemed really crowded only on Saturday night (after a big boxing match). We went to the Bayside Buffet and enjoyed that a lot. We got there at 5:30 pm, no lines at all, but when we left at 7:30 there was a fairly long line. There is a McDonald\u2019s across the strip, which we went to for quick breakfasts. You can walk through the Four Seasons on the way there or back. The flower arrangements in that hotel are stunning. I would definitely stay at Mandalay Bay again. If you really need to have two separate beds in the one bedroom, call a few days before you leave to request that."

Cabanas are the most exspensive I have every come accross in Vegas , and the smallest . Its a busy Pool, and beware if you have small Children under 48\" they cant use the Wave Pool, We saw lots of small children in tears being chucked out !!! . Not sure if the Life Guards are there for Life Guards Duties or Trying to get into Bay Watch !!.The rooms are nice, but it took 3 calls to get turndown service, a bit late arriving at 10pm !!"

We always leave the do not disturb sign on the door because we do not like to have housecleaning go through our stuff if we are only there for a couple days. The first two nights were fine. On the third night we came back from dinner and our room had been cleaned (even though the sign was on the door and the room was not entered before we left for dinner at 5ish.). I had left a right hand diamond ring ($300) on the counter under some clothes (we went to the pool earlier and I didn't want to take it and loose it.) The ring was gone when we returned. I was furious. I felt so violated that someone had not only entered the room and placed our clothes back ontop of our suitcase, gone through our stuff....but also stolen my ring. We called security who took almost an hour to come up to the room. The next morning the front desk staff failed to take any interest in my loss. Then I was told to call risk management when I returned home. When I called TRACY (a total b.....) refused to talk to me. Finally she told me that they refused to cover the loss and that was it. I was so upset with the way this hotel treated me. They were only interested in getting my money and did not care to alleviate the situation at all. Really unimpressed!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

The week was extremely chaotic and I wanted the largest suite so my wedding party and I could get ready there. I booked the 2 bedroom 1500 sq ft suite. To my disappointment, they overbooked the room (of course!) and would not give me the room eventhough they were available b/c it was only two people sleeping there. They said usually families book the room and would not give it to me. I wanted to get all bridezilla on them, but I didn't. They put me in the Mandalay Bay Suite, which was smaller and refunded me $50/night (whoptee do). Anyway, the did put me on the 60th floor which was cool. My BIGGEST disappointment... The carpet was TRASHED.... so much that when my girls walked on the carpet it left little holes from their heels that didn't go away for hours... Otherwise, not a bad little suite. I was extremely turned off that they wouldn't give me the suite I booked (and paid a deposit for), but I was tired and had other things to worry about. They toiletries were very high quality and I enjoyed them. The master bed was comfy and the room was great. Still the old style TV's, but who cares about the TV when you're getting married. The masterbath had a shower stall, and whirlpool tub, dual sinks, and a separate room for the toilet. Plenty of room there. The living room was great with a couch, love seat, chair and a bar with bar stools. The bar had a small sink and small fridge. One major problem I had with quality of room was 4 (yes, not exaggerating) lightbulbs were out in the suite. I called maintenance and they responded quickly and replaced them upon request. The 2nd night there another one blew out when I turned on the lamp... I ordered room service for dinner the first night and breakfast the day I checked out. The food presentation was wonderful both times. The one time they did not include napkins which was fine, but they should provide in the future for most guests. The did offer turn down service both nights. The first night I was already in bed (I went to bed very early), and the maid still asked eventhough I was IN bed. ? The second night was after the wedding and they had laid out our bathrobes and slippers, left a flower and godiva chocolates on our pillows. Very nice service indeed. We also got a chance to visit the pool which was VERY BUSY, and crowded. But very refreshing. Overall, I wish I would have gotten my upgraded suite that I booked (in February, nonetheless), a better discount for a shabby looking carpet, but the room service and maid service were superb in my opinion."

    "content": "I met a friend in Vegas for the weekend in the middle of a business trip. We have been there 7 times and have stayed all along the strip. We have always heard great things about this hotel, but were very disappointed. First I should clarify that we reserved a newly refurbished room and the beds were excellent! The bathrooms were clean but the tub showed a lot of wear and the towels were rough and stained. Check in was nearly a disaster. I came in at 7:00pm on a Friday. After a long wait, a front desk assistant started my check in process and then left me there while the guy next to her managed to checked in 4 other parties. She never came back to tell me the problem but I could see her just standing there like she was waiting for something. Finally she came back and said she had my room. I was supposed to get some free coupons with the room, but I had to ask for them. No bell man helped me with my bags which was a first for me in Vegas, so I had been dragging them around in my suit and heels after a very long day. I dragged my 2 wheeled bags down a very long carpeted corridor until I reached my room - I opened the door to find it scattered with empty beer bottles and a total mess. So I was not very happy when I dragged my luggage all the way back to reception. The good news is they gave me a $150 credit (after I demanded it). I then dragged my luggage to another room which was acceptable. The next morning I went to the pool at 10:45. There were absolutely zero chairs available!! I had to beg one off another party and it was not a lounge chair - it was a little upright chair so I couldn't lay on my stomach at all. For all the money we spent for that room, I was disappointed and will never stay there again."

    "content": "I stayed at the Mandalay Bay while attending a meeting, so didn't sample all the hotel had to offer. However, I was pretty impressed by what I did experience. Arriving well before the designated check-in time, I was pleased to learn they had a room available. The desk personnel were polite and efficient, and got me taken care of quickly. The rooms were large, well-equipped, well-maintained and clean. The food in the hotel was quite good. The fare at the restaurant Aureole was excellent and very creative but also very expensive -- about $100 per person with a couple of drinks but without any wine by the bottle. Aureole also features a \"Wine Angel,\" an attractive young lady who is hoisted vertically to retrieve the bottles of wine ordered from their four-story wine tower. Very silly. The House of Blues, right in the hotel, is great: casual, quick, good food, and not too expensive. The Rum Jungle was pretty wild, especially considering I was there earlier in the evening. It appeals to a younger crowd, and I can't image how it is later. The drawback, of course, is \"It's Vegas, baby!\" That means tons of temptations to skip a session to pull a handle or throw some dice, to wander the Strip, to do...well, anything but the meeting your company sent you to attend. Because it's Vegas, all roads lead through a casino. It's virtually impossible to get from one area of the hotel to the other without passing through the \"gaming\" area, which is of course how they planned it. And the walk from the hotel area to the conference center is quite lengthy. Wear comfy shoes if that's why you're there. The Mandalay Bay is connected to two adjoining hotels by tram, and it's right on the Strip so it's fairly easy to get to other locations, either on foot or by taxi, if you're of a mind. Room rates were pretty reasonable, but then that's not where they make their money. I'd stay there again, even if I was paying my own way."

    "content": "First of all I want to say, this is a beautiful hotel. The rooms are also very large. We stayed here last summer for three days with our two daughters, 9 and 13. The kids loved the huge windows. We would sit and just look out and admire the landscape. We are from Ohio and had never been out west before. We had also got a roll-away so the girls didn't have to sleep together. My daughter said that roll-away was the most comfortable bed she ever slept on and wouldn't give it up. It did have a super thick mattress on it. Anyways, I booked this hotel because of the pool. I knew the kids would love it, and they did, but it was very hard to ever find a chair. Very crowded!! One time, we had gone up to the pool closer to the convention center just to get away from the crowd, but it is no wave pool. Mostly adults wanting some quiet time, so I had to make my younger one kinda mellow out. The lazy river is crazy. The current is kinda fast which is actually fun but it is so crowded you're slamming into people (not fun). You have to buy the inner-tubes, which are like $18-$20 but they're worth it. We still have ours at home. Some people didn't want to buy them and walked around the lazy river. Looked silly, actually. My biggest complaint was we were really looking forward to going swimming one evening and couldn't. I mean it is so hot in Vegas day and night, it would of been a lot of fun. We got all of our stuff together and went down but everything was closed off for some corporate swimming party. You could see a lot of other people were disappointed as well. I think the pools in Vegas should stay open all night!!"

    "content": "First, even though you can get great rates at this first class resort in the off-season (we paid about $129 per night plus some freebies), be prepared to spend money. Everything is pretty expensive ... even for new Vegas standards. The check-in - the worst I have ever experienced. It took about 45 minutes and no central line. You just hope you picked the right line (which I didn't). There were plenty of vacant check-in terminals but not enough employees. The rooms - we stayed in the \"Gold Class\" DR 550 rooms. Very nice, spacious, nice bathroom & huge HD TV. We have 2 kids (elementary school & middle school) and staying on the 3rd flooer was very convenient. And very quiet although not much view ... but we are not sitting in the room admiring the view. The hotel - huge ... like the other major resorts ... and setup real nice. First class all the way. The casino is huge with multiple bars and not very crowded (probably because it is at the far south end of the strip). The food - expensive. We had one breakfast at the Bayside Buffet and it was among the highest price ($15.99 for adults) and the quality just average. Walk over to Luxor and save some bucks (and go to Luxor Beam website for coupons). Trattoria del Lupo we had appetizers at the bar that were terrific and the bartender (a guy from Towson, MD) was great. Took the family to Giorgio (in Mandalay Place) and had a nice, Italian meal for $101 (try to get the Mandalay Place coupon book for a discount at check-in). We considered the two Asian restaurants but the prices looked too high and the reviews mixed. The bars - go to Mix in the TheHotel. If you go before 10 there is no admission. We were able to sit outside at sunset and get a terrific view of the stip (Mix is on the 64th floor or something). The $15 martinis were worth the view. A nice (and apparently expensive) restaurant is also there. The casino bars at mediocre entertainment and gambling at the bar (including video BJ). We were comp'd while playing. The pool - the wave pool & lazy river are fabulous. The new casino looks great. But the pool is CROWDED. Get there early to get a chair. Very little shade made it difficult to stay past noon as the temps soared over 110. The lifeguards are strict on the 48\" height requirement for the wave pool and our 47\" child was told he could not use it. We brought our own blow-up tubes from Wal-Mart (and the pool staff even inflated them for us) as opposed to paying $16 for their tubes to buy or the $20 to rent the big tubes. We had more fun at the Tank at Golden Nugget (where we spent 2 days before finishing at the Ritz) but this is still a great facility. Overall, a little pricey but it is the new Vegas. I would avoid the buffet next time as it is way overpriced and the other restaurants are a bit overpriced. Get to the pool early or risk the crowded pools and no chairs. HINT - get yourself a MGM Mirage Visa card before you go and earn certificates that can be used for anything. I got one last summer and used it for work & personal stuff and had $675 in certificates making the 2 days at MB nearly free. Enjoy."

Housekeeping service was minimal - they changed the towels and made the bed but did not see any signs of sweeping bathroom floor or vacuuming in bedroom. On a lighter note: the pool area is very nice and large (hard to catch a cocktail waitress), rooms are nicely decorated, other staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Final note: with all the choices available on the strip did not feel that this hotel is worth our repeat business - will stick with the Venetian where we have stayed before and had good experiences. (Did not stay there this time due to construction nearby - thought we'd try someplace new)."

We needed to extend our stay at the hotel and I must say they were pretty unhelpful with this. First the rates were treble what we'd paid to start with then later in the week they couldn't accomodate us. I did this the service and general manner could be worked on but we had a really good time there. The wave pool and the beach that's in the hotel really are spectacular and something most of the hotels in Vegas dream about. The location is at one end of the strip and although you can see everything and where you want to go getting there is a different story!! The place is huge and being a bit further in would be an advantage. I'd stay again and I think the reviews of the hotel are a touch harsh."

I was looking forward to my stay since I had heard about the wave pool and the lazy river and you can only use the pool if you are a guest at the hotel. I arrived on a Saturday, tired from my flight only to be faced with long lines and over a 1 hour wait to reach the check-in desk. That pretty much characterized my stay at Mandalay Bay -- it was crowded, noisy, and there were long lines to do most anything. Mandalay Bay has some of the biggest conference room facilities on the strip but consequently that means that the hotel is swarming with people. Once I did eventually make it down to the pool area it was so crowded I wandered around for 20 minutes trying to find an open spot in which to sit. In the scorching sun there is not 1 umbrella or piece of shade in the entire pool area except for the cabannas (tents actually) which you can rent (if you have a reservation) starting at $500 a day -- the cost of a piece of shade. Highway robbery! I was furious! The inner tubes for the lazy river cost $20. I squeezed through the crowd in order to take a couple of trips around the (not so lazy) river and that was it for me. Great if you have kids but not so much fun for adults. Being a business traveler I then went in search for a quiet place to do some work. None to be found! On the second day, I noticed that the Ritz (the hotel next door) had what I was looking for -- peace and quiet! Unfortunately you have to be a guest there to enjoy it. Lastly, because Mandalay Bay is at the end of the strip you have to either be prepared to take taxis or rent a car in order to get anywhere else. The one good thing that I did enjoy was the room -- it was clean, large, nicely furnished and blissfully quiet -- the one saving grace!"

Was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews on this site and the relatively low ranking for a high visibility property, however, overall my experience was very positive. According to the front desk, all room renovations have been completed so don't worry about bribing your front desk clerk. Check-in at 5 PM was painless and there was no wait. We received a room on the 14th floor overlooking the pool area. Other descriptions of the room posted on this site are very accurate, you won't be disappointed! Bath amenities by Gilchrist & Soames were above average. Bedding was very comfortable and the room's climate control system worked well. Housekeeping had our room cleaned before noon every day of our stay. The expansive pool area was crowded and it's a shame that there are no misters anywhere in sight and shade is hard to come by. I assume they are hoping you will fork out the big bucks for one of their private cabanas. It was so hot (115+ in the shade!) that we actually spent very little time at the pool. This was despite the fact that one of our main reasons for choosing MB was the pool. Conditions were absolutely inhospitable. Our first dinner was at Red, White, and Blue. Average American fare with average service and of course above average prices. The next morning's breakfast was at House of Blues. Awesome, creative dishes but the service was terrible - in fact the worst of our trip. Lunch on the last day was at Border Grill walk-up counter. Their Nuevo Mexican cuisine wasn't for me, I'm a Tex-Mex traditionalist. I knew there would be some kids at the hotel, but I was starting to think we were in Orlando rather than Vegas. Even more alarming were the tykes under 5 out with their parents after midnight. Please folks, leave the kids at home and/or take them to Orlando instead. They have all the same comparable kiddie attractions there and your kids will have more fun. We overhead some folks on the elevator complaining about poor service at the Mandalay in line with comments on this site, especially compared to other comparable hotels on the Strip, but this was not our experience at all. Perhaps we were just lucky? Overall, would recommend this South Strip property if you're looking for high quality rooms and a great pool area. I would consider this hotel for our next stay in Vegas, along with the Wynn and a return to the MGM."

The casino is relatively smoke free and large. The pool is excellent and very kid friendly. The restaurants are okay but the service is slow. The elevators are extremely slow and crowded. The recent remodeling of the rooms was done very poorly and could use some work such as A/C vent covers missing, chipped and stained toilets, tiles missing etc. I was very disappointed and had wished I had stayed at Bellagio where I stayed last year. Even though the 2 bedroom suite at Bellagio was very dated it was immaculate and the service at Bellagio can't be beat."

Lunch at the poolside restaurant was convenient and the portions were huge! We had read reviews stating that the location was somewhat inconvenient since it is at the south end of the strip, but we used the tram system, as well as cabs and the Deuce (local public bus). We found the location less crowded than the properties in the center of the strip. The Deuce is reasonably priced ($5 for 24 hours), but very slow due to numerous stops and construction around the Bellagio. We visited numerous casinos, and found Mandalay Bay's to be high-end and not too smoky during the day. The kids wanted to see Shark Reef. I was skeptical because it seemed expensive, but it was enjoyable, and much more interesting than expected. Only one problem: one night, when we arrived back to the room around 11 pm, the room was not made up. A call to housekeeping fixed the problem within about 15 minutes. I did have to speak to a supervisor to get it done that quickly, but they were apologetic and friendly. Kids and adults had a great vacation and would return again!"

The rooms are quite amazing and large in size - the bathroom (complete tub and shower) was as big as the bedroom. We quite enjoyed the amenities in the room and he contemporary decor. The hotel staff was helpful and nice! We chose this hotel because of the amazing pool. The pool area is more of a waterpark complete with wave pool and many side pools and cabanas. Unfortunately, I believe the hotel allows locals and other hotel guests to buy admission to the pool area, so it is very overcrowded. We couldn't find a place to sit at 10 am! The wait staff is so busy, you only can order order a drink once every hour or two. But it is a fun social scene and relief from the heat. Our favorite restaurant and lounge in Vegas is lcoated at the top of The Hotel (attached to Mandalay Bay). Dinner is very pricey $$$$ but so worth the cost! Overall, a great Vegas hotel!"

    "content": "I was at the Mandalay Bay Resort at the end of June for a conference with my husband. I had read the many reviews on trip advisor before my stay and was not surprised when I arrived from a 5 hour flight from Florida to find that when we arrived at 12 am the room had not yet been cleaned... I was told that it would be around an hour an a half before that happened and was given a credit for room service and Raffles ,the only place open to eat at that hour. We asked if we could at least place our suitcases in the room so we didn't have to drag them around. It took us about 2 hours at Raffles to be served and for us to eat our meal. I can say that the food was really good ...even at 2:30 am in the morning. We finally got to go to sleep around 3 am and the room and bed were very nice and comfortable. The next day really cinched on how much Mandalay needs to work on their staff. We left the room and we always leave a daily tip for the cleaning staff. When I returned to the room around 2 hours later....the tip was gone and our room was not cleaned. I called housekeeping 3 times in 2 hours and was told that they would send up someone....never happened....finally I talked to the hiring manager and then received a call from the floor supervisor who told me she knew that the maid had taken the tip..and that she did not clean my room....but did not know her location...and had not been able to find her all day. They said they would return my tip and send someone to clean ASAP Needless to say that did not give me warm and fuzzies about the domestic staff that are allowed free access in my room every day. I requested that this particular maid did not clean my room again and that she was more than welcome to give the tip to the person that did clean my room . I had no further incidents in that area for the rest of the week. I was really surprised that for a hotel with a reputation for excellence...that they were so lacking in basic areas. This was my first trip to Las Vegas and most likely my last....as I would feel much more comfortable spending my time and money on a place that holds true to the standards that they advertise."

The negative of MB is it's location at the end of Strip, you can't hop across the street from Caesars, to Bellagio to MGM, to the Venitian, etc. as easily as you can when you stay in the heart of the Strip. But since I love the clubs, restaurants and beach at Mandalay, I don't feel as restless as I do when I stay at Bellagio or Caesars. I have also had very good luck at Mandalay as opposed to Bellagio where money gets sucked out of my pockets like there is a Hoover stuck in there. The Mandalay has a big, high ceilinged casino that is very comfortable and the public spaces roll nicely from casino to the restaurants and clubs."

    "content": "Mandalay Bay would like to give you the impression of being one of the upscale hotels on the strip - don't be fooled. Beyond the lobby it is just another hotel on the strip with rooms and service to match. If you are set on the wave pool, book a room at TheHotel or the Four Seasons (only marginally more expensive when I was booking). My impression of the hotel started when I stood in line to check in. and stood. and stood. Then, I was told i had to wait for a room. Not unusual I supposed, but I had a room booked for the previous night when my flight was unexpectedly diverted and thought (since I had paid for the room), i could get into a room. Only after explaining this several times did I get the room (and was told i was being done a HUGE favor as i was now being given a new room). The room was fine albeit with little annoyances (missing towel rings and toiletpaper holder). The hotel is huge so that if you are ttending a conference you have to walk and walk and walk - bring comfortable shoes because it is probably a 1/2 mile walk to the convention center. Checking out was another annoyance - a long, long line so I opted for the \"express\" check out where i could drop the bill in the box and get a receipt in the mail. More annoyance? Receipt never came. In short, I am not a big Vegas fan but I am sure you can do better for service."

We had no problems checking in, only took 5 mins and we got a large room on the 21st floor with excellent views of the strip. The room was a good size and had just been refurbished so everything was new and the room was cleaned early every day. The pool area is really good, especially the wave pool and beach, however it is so crowded and you cannot get a bed if you dont get there really early. The South lagoon pool seems to be the quietest, if like us you have had a late night and cant get to the pool by 9.00am! Good choice of restaurants and overall a good hotel, however I would not stay here again as compared with Bellagio where we stayed for a week last year, Mandalay Bay was not up to the same standard and being at the end of the strip, we found ourselves getting taxis every day and night down the strip for the best shops, restaurants, bars & clubs."

    "content": "I think I\u2019m addicted for life! It is going to be hard to go to Vegas and stay at a different hotel just because of the amenities alone. Let\u2019s start with the hotel room; nice is an under statement for a standard accommodation, we stayed in the newly renovated suite it was spacious and comfortable. Speaking of comfortable the beds are heavenly. Next item on the list is the bathroom; separate toilet and shower along with a great soaking tub was a nice touch to the guest room\u2026\u2026oh lets not forget the flat screen television strategically placed on the mirror so you can enjoy watching it, while soaking in the tub. By the way they give you great SPA treats like bath crystals and sea salt soap, makes you feel so rejuvenated after using them, nope\u2026\u2026.no cheap stuff here. But one other thing I must tell you about the rooms you should surf the internet for promotion codes before booking your stay. There are some great deals out there \u00bd the price you would pay originally for a stay. Okay let\u2019s get to the good stuff the pools were great; the wave pool was awesome and warm like a Caribbean Beach. The lazy river is great with the exception of the nominal fee for tubes (ridiculously high though @ $20 for 1 day sixteen to buy there) but on the other hand you can bring your own tube to the river, they sell them at the Walgreen\u2019s for $5. I like the fact that this hotel isn\u2019t the traditional Vegas hotel even though you\u2019re in the desert it gives you the elusion of feeling like you are in a tropical paradise. This place is great for romance, family and singles too. I think they have not excluded any class of people from this venue. I would bring my kids here to stay as well as feeling very romantic with my husband. But the trip was spent as a girl trips for my 35th Birthday and I wasn\u2019t disappointed at all with the atmosphere. I plan on coming back to Vegas in November for my husband\u2019s birthday. I believe we will stay here, I just like the fact that everything is in between not to much romance, not to many screaming kids and definitely not to many irresponsible college students. Like I said just right for whatever you\u2019re looking for!!! I would like to address the people who were concerned about Mandalay Bay\u2019s location. Seclusion is not a factor, they have done a good job with the TRAM system; this system is setup like the Las Vegas Monorail with the exception of serving three hotels which is the Mandalay Bay, Luxor and Excalibur hotels. After you catch the Express Tram to Excalibur hotel all you need to do is walk the skywalk that connects the Excalibur to the New York, New York hotel then take their skywalk that connects the MGM Grand Hotel; that\u2019s where you would catch the Las Vegas Monorail. True it\u2019s not near downtown but it\u2019s plenty of attractions on this part of the strip to keep you busy. My opinion about the distance of the hotels on the strip; is the fact is they aren\u2019t close any way you look at it, that\u2019s the elusion of Vegas; everything appears to be close but it really isn\u2019t at all. That\u2019s why we preferred to rent a car for our trip. Because there is so much to do in Vegas that you would spend most of the time walking; because it\u2019s so much to see and many things to do. So I guess it depends on how long you stay; but I wouldn\u2019t recommend renting until your first full day at the hotel. We came on a late night flight so we decided to rent a car the next day. We had an unusual situation were that the rental rates were cheaper at the airport rather then renting at the hotel; so Dollar picked us up at the Valet Parking area at Mandalay Bay Hotel for no additional charge. Why not rent a car Vegas makes it easy on you with free valet parking and self park and don\u2019t forget cheap rates. With that said don\u2019t sleep on Mandalay Bay\u2019s experience it\u2019s a world of its own!!!"

Check-in was quick and efficient, and it was wonderful NOT having to trek through the casino to get to the room elevators. We were on a high floor overlooking the Strip facing north, and enjoyed seeing all the hotels and even the dancing waters at Bellagio! The room was spacious, the two closets a treat and the bathroom luxurious. We ate breakfast and lunch at the hotel -- Raffles Cafe and Red White and Blue -- both were quite tasty and reasonably priced. Don't miss Red Square for a late night drink -- it was quite a scene! Although we did not have spa treatments, we did pay our $$$ and used the fitness room, sauna, steam and pools one morning. It was a great way to spend a few hours. The weather was chilly when we were there, and the pool under renovation, but it did look inviting and a lot of fun with all they offered. My gripe comes with the location. It was either A) tedious to take the shuttle to Excalibur and walk or B) an expensive cab ride to get to Bellagio, Mirage, Wynn, etc. For two nights it was OK, but if I were to return for a longer stay, I would want to be more centrally located."

We were sadly mistaken. 2 days before arrival I called to make sure a friend and I would be on the same floor and she also called 1 day before to confirm this, they said our reservations were linked together and it would not be a problem at check-in. My husband and I arrived earlier and the line was huge and the staff was slow. When my friend checked in 2 hrs later she was put on a different floor and when we asked the clerk she said it is not guaranteed and there was nothing she could do about it and was very rude...basicly \"You're SOL!\" So they were on a different floor. Upon getting to the room my husband took a beer out of the mini bar that was warm so he replaced it and we called the front desk so we could get credit...it was never credited! When calling the front desk it takes at least 5 minutes to get anyone on the phone and when they do answer they are totally rude! When my husband called to complain about not being put on the same floor as our friends they basicly said oh well. They didn't even offer us complimentary spa passes or anything! The mini bar stocker even came to our room the next day (at about 2 p.m. and hardly gave us enough time to answer the door, they just barged in) and saw that nothing was missing and didn't say anything! The beds were comfortable and the buffet dinner was good. The pool was great but very crowded. We arrived at 9 and shortly after there were no chairs available by the wave pool. Tubes for the lazy river were $20 to rent and $18 to buy! Hello, why do we have to pay for them we're already paying an arm and leg for the room, food, and drinks! Drinks were unbelievably priced. A Mai Tai was $13 and a bottle of water $10!! Poolside food wasn't bad but not much of a selection. The topless area was $10 for woman and $50 for men. It didn't matter if you were with a spouse or not. From what I could tell it was mostly men in there! Dinner at the sushi restaurant was good, expensive, and the service was extremely slow. There was one waitress for the whole place. Room service was fast and the yogurt parfait I had was good. There is a $2.50/person charge for room service so since I ordered a 1/2 pot of coffee with 2 cups we of course got charged for 2 people even though the other person was not eating anything! Also, there were no robes in the room! The shower door did not close all the way and so the floor was always wet. Housekeeping was poor and they often left trash in our room. I filled out a customer service form online and have not heard a word from this hotel! For the price I would rather stay at Imperial Palace. At least they have good customer service. I guess you don't always get what you pay for!"

    "content": "My husband and I stayed at Mandalay Bay for 3 nights beginning June 8th. I am an MGM/Mirage Players Club member (and since Mandalay Bay is now part of that group) I made reservations through casino marketing, and received a rate of $129 for Friday and Saturday night and $89 for Sunday night. When we arrived, there was a line at check in. I noticed that the clerk whose line I was standing in seemed very UNfriendly to the guests ahead of me, so I promptly moved to another! Having read the reviews posted here, I knew to request a renovated room, which I did at check in. (I used the \u201c$20 tip trick\u201d\u2026holding a $20 bill in my hand along with my credit card and I.D.) This clerk was very accommodating and assigned us to a beautiful strip view room on the 11th floor. Having stayed at Mandalay Bay two years ago, I knew immediately that we were in a renovated room because now there is a flat screen TV in the bedroom as well as a small one in the bathroom. (We stayed at Wynn last year and had the same thing\u2026I think Mandalay Bay took their \u201ccue\u201d from them when renovating). We enjoyed leaving the small TV in the bathroom set on the live feed from the Shark Reef downstairs. Pretty cool! Regarding the rest of the renovations\u2026the carpet appeared new as did the duvet. There was an IPOD dock on the bedside table which I don\u2019t remember being there before (but is also an amenity at Wynn). Another improvement is the bed which now has a down mattress cover on it, which is wonderful! The bathroom had a nice size tub and separate shower. There were two sinks which was nice. On the downside\u2026the bathroom floor was stained, which gave it a dirty appearance. In fact, I\u2019m not really sure it wasn\u2019t dirty. I was least impressed with Mandalay Bay\u2019s housekeeping. They never showed up before 3pm which was just about the time we liked to come back up to the room for a little rest! The only other negative thing about our room that I would mention is\u2026if you are a light sleeper, I would suggest requesting a room on the back (pool) side (which we had two years ago) because if you are staying on the front side with a strip view, you can definitely hear the traffic. My sister and her husband were in a room down the hall and commented on the same thing, although my husband, a deep sleeper, wasn\u2019t bothered by it at all. (Thankfully, I had my white noise machine with me!) There was the standard mini bar, with the standard ridiculous prices...and like most mini bars these days, if you lifted it\u2026you paid for it! ;-) There was also a desk and chair along with a comfortable chair by the window. Because we were celebrating our wedding anniversary on Sunday, my sister sent champagne and chocolate covered strawberries thru room service, which arrived as requested, and the strawberries were very decorative, wearing little tuxedos! (Sorry I didn\u2019t take a picture!) We never had to wait for an elevator. The halls and the common areas always looked neat and clean. They have a gift shop at the bottom of the elevator, as well as a nice place to buy coffee and pastries. By the way, I never had a bad cup of coffee at Mandalay Bay! The restaurants where we dined were all very good. We ate at Rum Jungle the first night, Georgio\u2019s the following night, and at Red Square the last night. We also ate at the buffet every morning for breakfast and enjoyed that very much\u2026one of the best buffets we\u2019ve eaten at in L.V. Of course, the restaurants are all very pricey, although Georgio\u2019s is less so. We found all the waiters to be friendly and helpful. The food at all of them was excellent\u2026the drinks at Rum Jungle were my husband\u2019s favorite! In fact, overall, Rum Jungle was our favorite place for the food, drink, and staff. To me every casino at the major Las Vegas hotels are pretty much the same. My husband said the dealers at the blackjack tables were friendly. However, I found drink service around the slot machines to be pretty scarce and slow. But they had just about every game and slot you could want to play. I am by no means a \"high roller\" but I found their comps very generous, if you're interested in that type of thing. I didn\u2019t use the pool on this trip so I can\u2019t comment on that but my husband went the one day while we were there and said it was very crowded. In fact, he said it was hard to find a lounge chair. This was surprising because everywhere we went, we were told this was the beginning of a slow time in Vegas. We attended two concerts while there\u2026John Mayer and Keith Urban. The Mandalay Bay Events Center is a nice place to see a concert. Fast and efficient concessions and plenty of restrooms. Ticket takers, ushers, and concession workers all greeted you with a smile. In my opinion, Mandalay Bay is an excellent hotel with very nice amenities and for the most part, friendly staff. If compared, I think Wynn has a bit of an edge over Mandalay Bay with the fact that they have superior housekeeping services (at least when we were there), what I consider a better location, and a newer hotel with rooms not in need of renovations . However, with that said, I would definitely stay here again, if attending a concert in their arena or if I received another good room rate offer."

We stayed in room #26124 and had a great view of the strip and the mountains. The airport is right across from the hotel and we never heard any planes taking off or landing. The room was very nice and clean. House keeping always arrived early and had our room cleaned to perfection. I left the maid $5.00 dollars a day, so this may have motivated her to clean well. Everyone we came in contact with was very nice and helpful. Only one slight complaint is construction crews started work around 9:00 am with loud annoying buzzing sounds. The pool area is awesome but very crowded. The construction around the pool was not a problem because they are almost finished with the outside casino project. Drinks are very expensive: beer $7.00 and frozen drinks are $12.00. Little advice, bring lots of money. If you get a chance go to Mix at The Hotel which is located on the 64th floor with outside seating and a view of Vegas that is awesome. Also, the Stratosphere has a restaurant at the very top with an even better view. Dinner cost us $150.00 but was worth it. My wife and I would stay at this resort again.

    "content": "I just returned from a weekend getaway in Las Vegas at the Mandalay Bay. I would not recomend this place at all. My wife and I arrived on a saturday morning at 9:30. I knew our room would not be ready but we had plans outside of the hotel all day and decided to check in and get our room assigned. I told this to the valet parking attendant telling him we would be right out. He told us he would hold our car for ten minutes. There was no line at the front desk and after checking my watch we were in and out in four minutes. Our car was allready gone. We then had to go down to the next level where you pick up your car from the valet which took ten more minutes. We arrived back at the hotel at 9:30 pm. When we arrived at our room we found leftover Mcdonalds cookies on the desk, and garbage in the cans. I turned the bed down and saw hairs on the pillow, at the same time my wife went into the bathroom to find the soaps in the sink open and used as was the same in the shower, and more garbage in the bathroom can. I then called the front desk and was put on hold. After a full five minutes on hold, we went down to the front desk figuring there would be a long line. when we got there, there was not a single person checking in, just the 5 front desk clerks conversing with themselves. I told them that I was put on hold for five minutes and thought there would be a big line when I got there. Their response was \"whats the problem\" not how can I help you, or what can I do for you, but whats the problem. What kind of question is that. With a 93 percent occupancy rate and premium room rates with record profits they just dont care. We changed rooms and went to sleep that night. The next day at the pool after spending 40 dollars to rent two intertubes for the lazy river and spending 48 dollars on 4 small margaritas I asked the waitress for a glass of ice water. I was told we dont serve ice water. I asked where there was a water fountain and was told there wasn't one but she could sell me a small bottle of water for 5 dollars. For god sake the place is in the desert, could you nickle and dime someone more. Everyone who worked at this hotel was either rude or pretentious. If you are under 25 years old and this is your once a year vacation and you dont mind being nickel and dimed to death then this place is for you. I usually take 3 weeks a year for vacation and 3 weekends a year to Las Vegas, so for me this was not a good deal. The hotel has potential with its setup but the people running it just dont care. You can have a much better time and value at either the Mirage or Treasure Island."

We were able to get 2 king rooms on the same floor. One was great but the other either still had someone in it or had not been cleaned. The bed was messed up, a towel in front of the tub and the light was on in the water closet. We left the room swiftly and called the front desk. The clerk was horrible but after I asked for a manager it helped. Moved us down from the 20th to the 5 floor because it was the only other one with two kings on it and it was a smoking floor. Bell man moved us and brought keys and manager gave us $100 credit towards food for the hassle. New rooms were fine but the views on 5 were horrible, I looked out onto an AC unit above a patio. They also did not seem as new as the upper levels. Room service credit quickly disappeared with 4 folks for breakfast. I would rate the rooms as slightly nicer than a generic airport hilton... Exotic stone in the bathrooms etc... but nothing to write home about... The casino is fine but kind of bland, nothing special about it appearance wise. Valet was great and on our last night I asked them to keep the car close so they put it in the vip parking right where you arrive so we had zero wait the next morning when we were leaving. I would go back if I got a great rate but not because of anything I experienced. I did not go to the pool."

The restaurants cover any type of food you might want. There about 8 different types of restaurants. The pool is equally as impressive as it consist of a lazy river and the propety has its own wave pool. The exercise facility is very satisfying as well. The Mandalay bay is the most southern property on the strip. A tram takes you to neighboring properties. To give you a point of reference, I paid $10 for cab fair to travel four miles to the middle of the strip."

We had to wait 4 hours for our rooms to be ready and then on our last day we were robbed $2,000 worth of stuff out of our room so far the hotel has done nothing. Sounds about the same with one of the stories below. It is very dangers and the have hardly any security. This is not a nice place to stay! Now my sister has a horrible memory of her 21st birthday."

    "content": "We booked this hotel through Southwest Airlines vacation package. I was very pleased with the accomodations. The standard room is a bit larger than most with a TV in the bedroom and the bathroom. The two negatives about the room is that the walls are thin so if people talk loud next door or in the hallway, you can hear it. The second thing is that they stock the minibar full of stuff so you can't use it for your own things. Apparently, your tab is charged automatically when you remove items from the fridge. The best part is the pool/beach area. You have to come early to get a lounge chair. There is a regular pool, wave pool with sand (beach) and a lazy river pool. There a also private cabanas you can rent but it looked like most people didn't do that. I'm glad I tried this hotel but next time would most likely try another place on the strip. Mandalay is at the very end of the strip so not quite as convenient even though the tram takes you to Excalibur. If you can get a good deal, I'd recommend staying here at least once."

    "content": "IStayed at MB from May 29th- June3rd. Arrived at 10:45am for check in and only 4 of about 20 stations were open. Lines were 10-15 deep in each line. The line i was in did not move for 30 minutes as the clerk was running back and fourth for the same person. It was so bad the 3rd and 4th people in lines jumped to others that had 10 people in them. At this point 2 other stations opened up and those clerks had the people flying thru them. They were checking in 2 people for every 1 person our clerk did. I finally recieved my keys at 11:30 which was a 45 minute wait. To my surprise the room was ready since you are not supposed to check in till 3pm. I was on the 3rd floor in one of the refurbished rooms. Room was very nice, clean and had lots of space for clothes. Nice flat screen hdtv on wall and a small one in the bathroom(HD channels start on 100 but only on big tv). Bathroom had 2 sinks,tub, shower and toilet. Like previous reviews said if you have a group who are all trying to get ready at once you may have a problem unless yoy don't mind showering or bathing while people are gettin ready. Also like a reviewer said earlier there is a window above the tub that has frosted squares in it but you can see thru it from the outside of the room so if you are modest and don't want people to see you you could be in trouble. Bathroom had plenty of towels and shower supplies. A phone was near the toilet so you could take care of business while you were taking care of business. Shower head had about 5 settings and the water pressure was great. Maids did a great job of replacing anything i used. The room had a refrigerator but i think it was one of those ones that come stocked with stuff and they charge you as you take stuff out of it. I needed one to put things in and i could not get that one open.(used garbage can) In room safe comes in handy to store money, ipods and sunglasses but is not that deep for anything else. Bed was comfortable and room stayed cool once i set tempature to 60 degrees. You do hear the doors slamming shut and the walls are better than other hotels i have been at in Vegas but you cant help hear a bunch of people laughing it up at 4am when they come in. I went to the Beach every day and you need to get their early if you want a chair. Especially if you are in a group and need alot of them. They pack them in like sardines so you do not have alot of room to yourself. Consruction was not a problem and is supposed to be finished in 2 weeks. Wave pool water was warm and for the most part clean. DO NOT forget your sandals as the sand gets very hot. Prices are kinda high down at the pools. Beer $7 or a bucket of 5 for $32. Gatorade $5, Small water$6, Large water $10, Mixed drinks were $12, cup of pepsi $2, Salads ranged from $9-$12 as did Burgers, Fries...etc.. I only ate at the House of Blues as those other places were out of my league. A single at the Buffet was $26 and i can't eat that much food. I think they need to add a Pizza Hut so all the places are not upscale. The people i talked to were very friendly and helpful and the whole Mandalay Bay complex was very clean. I would not hesitate to stay their again if i could get the same deal."

Check in: Got to hotel around 1 p.m, the line was really long, we waited for about 20 minutes. The women helping us was really nice. We upgraded to a newer room for $20 per night, worth every penny. We asked for any other upgrades, but you would have to pay for them all, there were too many people staying at the hotel for free upgrades (atleast thats what I was told) There were no pool or strip views available, unless we wanted to wait until after 3, or we could change in the morning. We decided to just change in the morning. Got to our room, average size room, had a nice big comfy bed, IPOD doc, a large plasma tv in bedroom, and a smaller one in the bathroom, his and her closets, very large bathroom, with nice soaker tub and seperate shower and toilet. Our room has an adjoining door, we could actually hear the people next door, and they werent even being loud. We went to the pool came back to our room, and called the front desk, told them about the problem, and the switched us to a pool view room no problem (since it was after 3) The pool/beach: Beach area is always pretty busy, we found a pool (South Lagoon) to be our favorite area, because there was never anyone there. They give you towels at the pool, make sure everyone in your room has there room key because thats how you get access to the pool area. Resturants: Everything at this hotel is expensive, we at at Border Grill, Giorgio, and Burger bar, all were very good. Overall great stay at the MB, we checked out lots of other hotels while we were there, and we liked MB best. Pleas email me if you have any other questions.\\ beckydrake@suddenlink.net"

We called Guest Services and complained for the 3rd time, finally they credited our first night stay and gave us 2 tickets to the aquarium. That made up for their lack of hospitality but it's not what we expected. The bed was comfortable and staff was really friendly. We had a lot of fun at the pool.

Here is our run down - we arrived late Monday night, checked in about 10:30. We had a reservation for a 550 room and had been invited because of our play to stay at a special rate. We were quoted $89 a night - FANTASTIC. When we checked in my husband asked about any upgrades and we were given a spa suite. So wow even better. The room was amazing, we had a mountain view but it was still great. The bathroom - seperate shower and water closet, double sink, TV & a huge double soaker tub with jets. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud. Make sure you call down and ask for robes to be sent up - so soft. We checked out via VIP services and they took off all our local calls - which were $1.00 each, our meals at the hotel (charge your meals to your room = you never know what they will comp at check out). The Beach is so worth it. We went 2 times and had no problem finding lounge chairs (we did hear comments about it being quiet in Vegas that week), the sand and water is super clean. We had a great time and added on 2 friends that were staying at another hotel to our room so they could come to the pool with us. All in all, this is the first hotel in Vegas that I ever felt like I never wanted to leave and always want to come back to (it was our 4th time in 3 years). We will be back!!"

Opened then, inside, lit artwork in the entryway, an entire wall of windows from bedroom to bedroom, coral accented dining area with seating for 4, a cozy living area with large, flat-screen t.v. Bar, lovely, lots of counter space and a Bose stereo system. HINT: The guest amenities books are hiding in the living room. It's in a lovely case that looks like artwork or a vase... turn it around and there are 2 books inside. My bed was comfy!! Another large screen t.v. on my dresser. Large bathroom, whirlpool tub, separate shower, separate room for toilet, phone near toilet, smaller t.v. over sinks viewable from tub. My friend's room seemed to have a different layout - I think her toilet was NOT in a separate room, but right next to her tub. We both had queen beds. We didn't eat/drink at Mandalay, or even shop there for that matter. Cab rides to & from Mandalay were very reasonable. $6.00 to $20.00, including tip, to & from various casinos on the trip i.e. Treasure Island, Monte Carlo. Didn't get to enjoy the pool - my friend was too hung-over and I didn't want to abandon her. The pool LOOKED very inviting!!"

Especially considering how poor the service was in our room. I'll start with the cons- our room was dirty!! Not dusty, I mean wrappers and food under the table hasn't been vaccumed in weeks dirty! There was shrivled up mushrooms and a pizza hut sauce container under our table by the windows. Very gross. Our maid also never really cleaned while we were there. An empty beer bottle left out for her disposal sat on the bathroom counter all week long, the tissues were never replaced (I ended up buying a box!) and ice was never brought in (yes, we could have fetched our own, but even the Flamingo refreshed our ice bucket every day, and they're hardly a 5-star resort). So the room was a major disappointment, but the rest of the resort was great. Very pricey, but great. The pool area was very clean and chairs were abundant. A window in the hotel broke on Tuesday, and apparently it was magic glass that had the ability to shatter over the entire 11 acre pool area, so the entire place was closed- for the whole day. We were shuffled to the South Lagoon pool instead which was crowded, noisy, and offered no shade. But aside from that the other days at the pool were perfect. There are plenty of places to eat, all of them super expensive, but good. We ate at Red Square, the noodle shop, and Red White and Blue. All were excellent. So overall, we had a great stay. If we go again we'll most likely stay on the strip, but for the convention it was nice to stay right there. Incidentally, I think I liked my room at the Flamingo better than the modern art room we had at Mandalay Bay. Just personal opinion."

We spent a lot of time at the pool and even though construction was going on it didn't affect us at all. The drinks are expensive ($7 for a beer), but it's like that at all higher end resorts. We ate at the China Grill which was very good, everything is family style to share and the service was extremely good there. We had breakfast at House of Blues, which was good as well as the buffet, also good with a big selection. We also ate at Red White and Blue which is casual and was what we wanted. I would recommend all the restaurants there. I know a lot of people talked about the location, but unless you are going to old Vegas it isn't that bad. The tram gets you to where MGM and NY NY is and you can go from there. We walked every we went.

My only complaint is that the lighting in the bathroom was very dim- not conducive to applying makeup. We stayed on the 32nd floor & had a perfect view of the pool area. We spent one day at the pool. The pool area was sooooo crowded on Saturday & there were a lot of kids. After spending an hour in the wavepool, we went to Club Moorea- the European style pool area. I thought there would be naked girls everywhere, but luckily only a handful of girls took their tops off- mostly older ladies. It was fun to get away from all the kids & just relax. The only complaint i had is that there were little styrofoam balls EVERYWHERE from the construction they're doing. The pool & every person in the pool was covered in them. It kinda sucked. Megan, the concierge, was so helpful getting us VIP to the Playboy club! Other than that, everything was ridiculously expensive (as to be expected, i guess). We had dinner at Aureole & it was so delicious, but $$$. I will definitely stay at the Mandalay Bay again.... after saving up some money."

    "content": "I have stayed at Mandalay numerous times over the past few years. I travel to Vegas frequently for boxing, and like to stay in Mandalay to be near the Events Center. You have to understand one thing, this is Vegas. If you're looking for tranquility, Mandalay is not the place for you. With the large number of popular restaruants and clubs, of course it is going to draw a young crowd. No problems with that here. Beautiful women are a constant at Mandalay. Again, no problems here. The pool area is nice, although it does get quite crowded, and tons of kids. I agree with the previous poster, who brings kids to Vegas anyway?? I did have one major problem with Mandalay, which is the reason I only gave the property an average rating. Upon check in an authorization of $900 should have been taken on my credit card. The front desk clerk took an authorization of $9000!!! Front office management was unresponsive when I asked them to call the bank and release the hold!! I understand people make mistakes, but this was completely unacceptable! It took writing a letter to the General Manager to get through to anyone. They comped me on my next stay, but needless to say this was a very frustrating experience. Overall, I think for the money there are better places to stay in Vegas. However, if you want action on a big fight weekend, Mandalay is the spot."

The only peculiarity is the layout of the bathroom - if you are traveling with a group, there is no privacy in the bathtub and/or shower with respect to the sink area. There are double sinks, but the bath and tub are in the same immediate area, tub is open and shower has clear glass doors. This restricts how fast a group can get ready - only one person at a time if showering/bathing is involved. This should be looked at - even frosted glass on the shower would be helpful. Aside from this peculiarity, the property is resort-like and one could easily spend a week without ever leaving the property. Many food/entertainment choices, clean, plush, excellent ambiance, Mandalay Place is nice for shopping. Pool area among the best I have been to thus far. Conference facility run very smoothly - food was delicious. Service efficient, never had to wait for anything. I would highly recommend this property to anyone, and if you can get it at a great rate, don't hesitate to book!"

I usually can't afford the room rate, but my company was paying for the hotel, so I was excited about staying there. I checked in and was given a room on the 32nd floor. I had a great view of the pool, but the room was nasty. Big stains on the carpeting (like someone had eaten on it) ... felt like I needed to wear socks when walking on the carpet. Not what I expected from a supposedly high end hotel. I called the front desk and they moved me to another room on the 20th floor. What a difference! The room was newly renovated with nice decor, a comfy bed, large flat screen TV (and a smaller one in the bathroom) and IPod clock radio. I was totally satisified with this room. Pros: The renovated rooms. Great pool. Super sportsbook. Nice bar/entertainment at the sushi restaurant. Walkway to Luxor. Cons: The unrenovated rooms. Expensive restaurants. High minimums for table games. Attracts a young (and rowdy) crowd because of the House of Blues. Slow check in."

It is basically not walking distance to other hotels, unless you utilize the tram (which is quite HOT during the May/June months). My complaint lies in the current condition of the property. The Mandalay is doing extensive construction on the pool, various walkways/entrances and the hotel rooms as well. I know many of us don't covet the opportunity to sit on a construction site and hear drills going all day, but this is how I felt while I stayed here. Let me say, quite a vacation! At 8:30am, I was awoken by the constant hammering in rooms it is attempting to re-model. I requested to be moved, but this place was jam packed and the only spot they could move me had construction going on 2 floors above versus the floor above. Alas, I seek salvation at the pool so I could go back to sleep. Well, I find a nice lounge in front of the pool, and literally not 5 minutes later, I hear a very loud sawing noise. I look back and see that they are working on building a new restaurant. I couldn't find a place to go w/o construction going on. I was thinking, why not have flood lights out here at night, and do the construction then, when no one utilizes the pool, but probably a union issue. Anyway, I asked the front desk when this should all be over and she told me at the end of June. However, I wanted to speak to an actual worker since I was so pissed off and this was suppose to be my vacation. He told me they probably won't be done until July. You'd think the Mandalay would make sure to have the place going full throttle during the summer months, but I guess tthey just didn't plan so well."

This does not fit well in a hotel where many of the patrons are getting into rooms drunk at 3 am, and the rest of us need to get up at 6 am. I was awakened most nights. I had problems with check in. 45 minutes after getting into the registration line, I was finally in my room only to open the door and find they had booked me in a dirty room. Yuck. I was then rebooked into a smelly smoking room when I had requested non smoking and was told there was not another non smoking room. My room itself was spacious. I thought the color scheme was boring if not depressing. The rooms have been updated with IPOD docking station clock radios and flat screen TVs. The pillows smelled dirty. I left my room by 8 am most days and it was not made up until late afternoon. The safe did not work when I checked in and security had to come into my room. Room service was delivered sooner than promised, which was nice. Checking out meant another wait in a line to have my bill corrected. I do not gamble and to me this is clearly not a business center hotel"

Since our last stay the rooms have been remodeled! (Be sure to ask for a recently remodeled room!) The bathrooms were very nice and luxurious with seperate (large) tub and shower. Double vanity and potty room. The beds are comfy and the linens were a higher quality than before. The pillows were VERY hard but I called the front desk and they sent up two perfectly soft pillows right away!! Every employee that we encountered from check in to check out was very helpful and accomodating. (Including the casino workers.) We love to eat at House of Blues for breakfast. Their food is consistently good. Saturday night HOB transforms from a restaurant to a 70's disco with a band called Boogie Nights. They were petty good, the DJ was great when the band took breaks, but we had SO much fun! There were people in there from 21 to 81 dancing and having fun! Everyone was getting along! We rented a cabana by the pool one day. Not much luxury there. The beach scene was pretty wild and crowded but we were stuck back in the farthest pool area. Kind of stark without the landscaping of most Vegas pools. Servers were very nice and helpful but basically just a lounge by the pool. Cabana was too small for anything but a table that seats 4. You must get in line at 7:30 a.m. to get a lounger. Put your towels and magazines on it, then go put on your swim suit and come back when the sun is out! This hotel has beefed up their rooms, their service and their price. It is still a pretty good value. Vegas is just more expensive than it used to be! If you really are wanting to treat yourself to a little better room stay at THE HOTEL (all suites, same building & pool, just across the casino floor from Mandaly) or get a Lake view suite at Bellagio! Lakeview is a bit more but SO worth it when the fountains go off!"

Apparently all the newly upgraded rooms are on low levels so don't expect a good view. The flat screen TV had terrible reception and just seemed merely like decoration rather than quality. My only major problem was the kids. I am not against kids but when I go to Vegas I don't want to be around too many. The place was absolutely swarming with them....hundreds upon hundreds packed around the pools and just generally running every where. I understand that the Wave pool at Mandalay and Vegas as a whole is starting to cater to more towards families, but I felt like i was in Disney. Both Mix Restaurant and StripSteak were exceptional, but be prepared to pay. On the whole, Mandalay Bay was decent, but I do not plan on returning there. The upgraded room was only as good as the Bellagio standard room. The pool area was too overcrowded and too many kids. I would recommend the Restaurants though. Aereole (from a previous trip) was also excellent. Sometimes you can get Mandalay bay for a decent price, but having now stayed at Bellagio, MGM, Luxor, and Caesars as well as Mandalay Bay, the Bellagio beats them all hands down. I am definitely willing to pay a little more for a more classier, quieter environment. After a late night of partying, (we are in our 30's) I just want to relax at a nice pool not a water park!!"

    "content": "We chose Mandalay Bay based on its #1 ranking for pools in Las Vegas. I am writing this from the hotel, on our second night. I have a mixed review... The pros: The pools must be heated b/c it was 53 degrees our first morning here but the pools were still swimmable, at least 75 degrees, I'd guess. My kids had a great time. Our room was spacious and clean. Tremendous water pressure in shower (not sure why - aren't we in a desert?). The cons: Our room did not have enough drawer space, and the drawers in the huge television wardrobe were in bad shape with the bottoms sagging down and clothes slipping out and down preventing the drawers from closing properly. A light was out in the bathroom making the vanity area dim, and the bathroom and closet doors were very squeaky; they needed an application of WD40. The bathroom fan did not work. Despite the kid-friendly pool, there was no game room or other amenities for kids. Long walk to the pool. My kids complained that the waves in the wave pool were too infrequent... they had to wait a while for the next wave to body surf on. The lazy river was great but at $20 per tube per day, we felt ripped off. I would recommend that other travellers bring deflated tubes from home. Everything was VERY expensive: food ($12 sandwiches), frozen drinks ($12), water ($5), internet access ($13/day per laptop), black jack tables ($15 minimum bet). There were a couple of notable 'free' things: parking, and the tram to Luxor and Excalibur. The tram was great and we took it to Excalibur where there was a wonderful kids arcade and game room, plus $5 blackjack tables! To summarize: I would recommend Mandalay Bay if you are travelling between mid-April and October with kids who love to swim and if you bring inner-tubes from home. Bring drinks and snacks from home as well. If the pools are not your focus, I think other hotels on the strip have more ambiance and more energetic public spaces. Travelling on expense account would help as well!"

Drink service (except around 3 AM which oddly is much faster than any other time) The Room (they are remodeling, when we complained about our they gave us another room) High table minimums (even during the week midday) The pluses The restaurants (restaurant RM and RumJungle) The Spa Single Deck Blackjack Friendly staff (even the pit bosses) All in all Mandalay Bay is a great place to stay."

    "content": "Just got back from 5 great days in Vegas but only a mediocre stay at Mandalay. The vibe here may be the biggest problem. Can you say \"tired\"? The Casino and most of the common areas are a bit 1980s Hyatt Regency. The rooms that have not been renovated feel the same - I was in a friend's renovated room and must say that perhaps great things lay ahead - but my non renovated room was again, of the the 80s Hyatt. Additionally it had no honor bar! As a result, when i simply was too tired at one point to leave the room, I incurred a $38 room service charge for some fruit when a $6 box of nuts would have sufficed! As a result of all this mediocrity, the place was dead. There was no energy in the Casino and very few people there. I visited the Bellagio, Mirage and Hard Rock on this visit for various shows and restaurants and all of those hotels had their usual mojo working - great crowds, high energy. Even THEhotel, where I attended an after hours party in a beautiful and HUGE suite, seemed sedate. By the way, in such an empty boring casino, how about bringing those table minimums down? The most egregious offense: Half of the pools at Mandalay are currently undergoing reconstruction. This includes the infamous \"European Bathing\" area. The upshot is that TOO MANY people are squeezing themselves into too small a pool area and that far too many of those people are CHILDREN (again we ask, why does anyone bring children to Vegas?) Trust me on this - the pool vibe at Mandalay is currently unacceptable. Children are crawling around everywhere and their parents are doing nothing but chasing them down. After getting the agreement of several other guests, I met with the pool manager and asked if he could cordon off another area (south bay pool, anyone?) and make it 21 plus. After saying he'd think about it he must have decided not to do it. In a five day stay, I used the pool twice - major disappointment. Looks like they are planing something great for the reopening, but with no prior disclosure from hotel management, consider yourselves warned by me. On the plus side, the restaurants and clubs at MB are pretty great: I tried StripStrek, Noodles, HOB Red White Blue and Red Square. All were all great at what they do. Reality though, is that MGM is just renting out space to places with good management. If Mandalay Bay were managed as well, this would be a better review."

They were ready and waiting for me to pick up on arrival. The great thing about this level of customer service is that Mandalay Bay is a popular hotel for weddings, birthdays and other special occasions. It's a hassle to load up your car or plane baggage with gifts. Just call or e-mail The Chocolate Swan and they'll customize a wonderful gift for you in advance. I bet they would even arrange to have it delivered to your room, althought it's a very short walk from THEhotel or the Mandalay rooms. Highly recommended!"

The other members of my team (4 of 6) had rooms with high-beds, nice threadcount sheets, with down pillows and flat screen HD TVs in the bedroom and bathroom (thus removing the big, boxy TV housing furniture unit). I assume renovations were made, but have no idea why I was placed in such a horrible room! I was very unimpressed."

    "content": "Just returned from a week at the Mandalay Bay. First let me put any normal person at ease who is trying to sift through conflicting reviews of virtually every property in Las Vegas and wondering what to believe. The Mandalay Bay is a wonderful property, very well maintained, offering more than adequate lodgings and amenities. Period. Be happy to stay to here. If you have what you believe to be a favorable rate at this hotel take it and rest assured you will not be in trouble. To read the odd bad review of a place because of a randomly long wait in a line or something is to wonder at the sanity of the rest of the world. Some of the reviewers on this site seem to have such high standards, one wonders if they are happy anywhere. But anyway, the hotel itself, in terms of the quality of its surroundings is absolutely great. Staying at this hotel is staying at a high quality resort no doubt about it. That being said, there are a couple of things to be aware of about The Mandalay Bay. First, you have probably already read or will read reviews that crow about the \"renovated\" rooms and that suggest that you ought to ask for a renovated room at check-in. Taking this advice, we did ask for a renovated room and we got one. What no review we saw said, however, is that the hotel will charge you an extra $20 per day for the renovated room. Okay. Taking everyone's word for the difference, we chose to pay the extra $20 and were rewarded with a very nice room. It had a giant flat screen tv on the wall (as well as a smaller one in the bathroom). The beds were extremely comfortable and luxurious according to my wife and two kids, although I personally prefer a firmer mattress. The bathroom was cavernous with a large bath as well as a separate shower equipped with a generous showerhead that was sufficiently generous that I actually felt guilty about using it in the desert. One aspect of the bathroom that I thought was peculiar was the window into it as you walk into the room. In theory I suppose there were strips of transluscent material laced in the window that would obscure a perfect view to the interior and shower. But the reality is that you could see into the bath area. The toilet had a separate stall inside, but you could see into the double sinked area and the tub and into the shower. We did not find this to be a problem, but I guess some people might. Oddly, in this day and age of cable television with millions of stations, the television did not offer such variety. Virtually none of the cable channels our kids might have expected to see were available for the odd times when we were in the hotel room and they wanted to give the fancy big tv a spin. It seemed odd to me that they would bother to paste a giant fancy tv on the wall and then not hook it up to more than a few stations. On the other hand, we weren't there to watch tv, so I didn't particularly care about this either. Other people might I guess. The pools are great for the kids and we spent quite a bit of time enjoying the hot weather by the pools. The pools open at 9 AM and people line up early to get in first and grab a seat. Here's a big secret: DON'T line up at the entrance where everyone else is. There is another entrance at the back that nobody wants to line up at for some reason. You will get in right away and have your pick of the seats. The wave pool is really cool and the kids will enjoy it. Ours did. There is also a lazy river that the kids like as well. The lazy river is a nice winding circuit that passes to the great delight of the kids under two waterfalls that dump enormous amounts of water on the swimmers (who choose to steer under it). Here is a caveat about the lazy river. The resort will charge you $20 to rent a tube for the lazy river. As far as I am concerned anyone who pays that to rent an innertube is an idiot or so wealthy that the insult is lost on them. Here's a tip to anyone who doesn't want to feel like the resort is spitting in their face. Walk about a block down the strip to Walgreens and buy a tube for $5.99. This theme of obscenely overpriced items purchased in the resort is oft repeated. Here are a few examples. A hot dog by the pool will cost you (if you are an idiot or so wealthy you don't care) $7.95 and a bottle of water will run you $10. Once again, if you make a quick trip to Walgreens you can supply yourself with water and snacks for the pool at prices reasonably close to those you might find on planet earth. A disposable camera that retails for $10 will cost you $20 if you take it from your hotel room instead of buying it retail. I don't necessarily consider this a negative to the hotel because these things are not necessary for you to enjoy the hotel's benefits as a nice place to sleep and a nice place to hang out by the pool and swim. You just can't buy their overpriced accessories. Would it be nice to be able to buy a hot dog by the pool and not feel like you were an idiot? Sure. But there are simple enough alternatives. It isn't as if the resort is so huge that you really have no way to escape and get water and hot dogs elsewhere. So be it. Oh and back to the pool for a moment. There were oddly enough virtually NO umbrellas by the pool. Not sure what the idea is behind this concept. Maybe it is to try to make the pool such a hostile place that nobody dares stay more than a couple of hours at a time so that they will go back into the casino and spend money. If you get to the pool early, which I recommend, unless you have radiation resistant skin and/or spf 1000 sunblock, you can manage to find one of the half dozen or so seats that exists in the shade of some of the palm trees. One morning on a whim I actually called to find out about the price of renting one of the cabanas by the pool. I was never able to establish the cost of this, however. Nowhere is the price listed on any of the materials in the hotel room and when I called the front desk they \"didn't know\" trying to get me to speak to some other department. At that point, I was no longer sufficiently interested in learning what king's ransom it would be for shade by the pool and so I never did find out. It probably was one of those situations in which if you have to ask the price, well then.... So just get there early and find one of the shady seats and you will be fine. Otherwise, you probably won't last too long baking in the direct Las Vegas sun. We went to see Mamma Mia while we were there and it was fantastic. The theatre is enormous and comfortable, with soft rocking seats and cupholders even. Great theatre. We took two kids with us, 8 and 11. We had a fine time. We enjoyed the pool, we went to a magic show, we saw mamma mia, and we took a drive one day to see the real world around the fake world of las vegas. Here's another piece of advice: Resist the tours and rent a car. You can spend $100 per person to take a tour to the Valley of Fire. Or you can rent a car for $60 and drive there yourself. We also saw the Hoover Dam and got to go on our schedule. It was great. By the way, The Valley of Fire is incredible. With young kids you might be tempted to take on The Grand Canyon in a day trip from Las Vegas. Not so sure that's a great idea. Long day. The Valley of Fire is under an hour from Las Vegas, it is really really cool looking, and a much more manageable morsel of a trip for kids. Make the Grand Canyon its own trip as opposed to a day trip from Las Vegas. Depending on your kids' (and your) level of energy, you can drive though stopping at various spots along the way, or you can stop and hike into some more interesting locations. There is plenty to do for the tame and adventurous alike. And when you're done, you have less than a hour to go to be back at the hotel. Anyway, back to the Mandalay Bay. Great Property. Very resort like. If you have a good rate, you should take it and be confident that you'll be just fine."

    "content": "We arrived early and didn't expect our suite to be ready but we had reserved a cabana by the lazy river so we were good to go until late afternoon.When I called the first time the room wasn't ready so I called back around five and they said it was now ready.Well my first red flag was a foot high pile of dishes outside the doors of our room.This suite is one of the newly renovated I think they call it a\"Gold Class 1500\" I give it a\"Bronze Class\".It looked at first sight like it was clean but the longer I stayed in there which was all of an hour the more I found out how not clean it was including magazines,wrappers and paper on the floor,there was old newspapers and other items in the drawers,dust on all the furniture,hair in both bathrooms along with dirty,stained,cigarette burned bathtubs with some sort of pieces of something in there too.Then we got all of three towels one of which was stained and had holes in it. I called for more but by the time they brought them we were getting out of that room for good.The light in the toilet closet was also burned out so the maids sure must have cleaned that in the dark- if at all.The mini/snack bar was also messed up with things not even in place.They also show on the web-site that there is I-Pod dockers in the room but we didn't see one in either bedroom like in their pictures.We went to the front-desk and they upgraded and moved us to an older but much cleaner suite except for the conecting room which had burns in the carpet and on the curtains. The pool area is still undergoing renovations and is hard to walk around to certain areas because it is so crowded and chairs are hard to come by unless you get there when it opens at nine.The cabanas are great if you are willing to pay the price they have a flat screen tv a table and chairs,couch,lounge chairs and a stocked fridge with ice,soda and water.The drink and food service can be very slow it took an hour and a half to get a food order and they said to order ahead it is common to take that long. Bring you own innertube (they will inflate it) or it is $20 to rent one. Casino is Ok with high table minumums go next door to the Luxor or the Excalibur for lower.Machines were not the best paying that I played or did I see anyone hit anything big. The Cafe at The Hotel was very good and well priced and the Red,White and Blue Deli had good food also. Plenty of nightlife at this hotel not much shopping and Shark Reef is OK but not great if you have already been to Sea-world."

In fact the only decent thing is the view if you get a high floor on strip-facing room - simply stunning. Pool area is decent although $20 for a tube is taking the p***, and construction detracts from the tropical paradise intentions. The lifeguards really were fun-nazis and seemed to whistle just about anything that involved people enjoying themselves. Safety is one thing but these kids just had attitude problems. For a classy stay go for the Venetian - for overall value for money/facilities go for MGM Grand. I wont be going anywhere near this dump again."

    "content": "My husband and I were there the weeeknd of March 30, 2007. From beginning to end everything was perfect. Check in had a line but it moved. We had a reservation for a suite but upon check -in we were put in the renovated suites! A HUGE difference from the older suites. The service was excellent at ALL levels. I know some people complain about the location of the Mandalay but we never left the hotel the whole time. We had everything we wanted right there. I think if it is your first time in Las Vegas you may want to stay somewhere more centrally located. But if you have been to Vegas many times you may like the out of the way location. It is not so crazy and not too many tourists I think. The pool is a crazy scene. A word to the wise claim your real eastate early or good luck finding a beach chair anywhere! We put our towels down around 9:30am and came back an hour later and the place was PACKED! Anyone getting there @1pm is going to have a tough time finding a spot they want. The Lazy River is fun but cold and you have to pay $20 for a floaty tube. As others have mentioned everything is pretty pricey. Cocktails at the pool are $12 EACH. Beer is $7.00. A sandwhich at the pool is $12.00. Lunch at the HOB was $80 for two. Dinner at the Border Grill for 2 was $120. Dinner at Lupo for 2 was $130. All in all this hotel is excellent Vegas! It is clean and doesn't smell bad. The service is wonderful. The food is outstanding! No bad meals. I say stay here is you don't care about location."

That in itself isn't a problem, but the location is a fair bit away from the main areas of action. It didn't really bother us, but I can understand how that may pose a problem for some people. I have to say I found the pool area to be quite good, and enjoyed the food in the various eateries. Rooms are adequate, and in fairness to the cleaning staff always were kept in decent condition. I guess the main thing missing was that certain \"Oh la la\" and Razzamataz you expect when coming to Vegas. Things overall were acceptable, but then again is that what people are looking for when they come to Vegas?"

The common areas (casinos, restaurants, convention center, pools, etc) are very nice - however my room left ALOT to be desired. I was on the 30th floor, with what they called \"pool\" view... which amounted to a nice view of the airport, which is across the street. The bed was extremely uncomfortable, and the furniture was missing many pieces (ie, could not open drawers since the handles were missing). Never once did I have a full set of towels (and I stayed a week), and I had to ask for laundry bags several times before receiving them. The bathroom was nicer, but one morning I had no water and was told it would be a least an hour if not more for someone to check on it. I understand that they are renovating rooms, but until that is complete I would not waste money on the Mandalay Bay. You can get a much nicer room and location at the Venetian or Bellagio for a lot less money than I paid for the Mandalay Bay."

(We had requested non-smoking king.) The beds were horrible and I'm really fairly easy to please. There was nothing else that really made the room special. When we complained at check-in that they did not have our requested room for us, they offered to move us the next night. Let me tell you, it was well worth the hassle of changing rooms. We moved to a room on the 14th floor. It was SO much better! The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in - even better than mine at home! Down comforter, down mattress top, double sheets....need I say more? Comfy!! Everything was new, carpet, decor, bathrooms. There was a huge flat screen tv in the bedroom, and another mounted on the wall in the bathroom. There was a large soaking tub and a glass shower. The toilet was in a closet by itself. Double sinks, marble floors, granite counter tops. The room had a minibar, where the previous did not. The view of the strip was spectacular. Overall, I can give the hotel an above average review thanks to a much better room the 2nd night."

The check-in clerk mentioned this while I discussed the bill on Monday. It seems that if you open the bar fridge and pick something up, it charges your room immediately. Same for the snack tray on top. Of course there is no sign indicating this. This is a great place for couples or groups that want to party and have fun. BUT bring your wallet and it better be full. It won't be when you leave. A single plastic cup pina-colada at the pool was $11.50. The beers (domestic) were $7.00 each. Food wasn't cheap either. 2 coffees in the morning were almost $6.00. Don't get me wrong, the room was clean but the housekeeping staff couldn't keep the extra towels or glasses in the room. The last night we didn't even have clean glasses after the room was serviced. The wave pool was pretty neat. Kids must be 48 inches tall to go in. Lazy river was cold. Want to rent a tube- $20? Other pool was quiet and warm. Some renovations going on so the whole pool area wasn't open yet. In fact the wave pool opened the day before we arrived. There were many lifeguards watching and reacting to actions taken in the pool. They were great that way. I can't comment on the lounges or bars because we had the little ones with us. We travelled through the casino many times and even though smoking is allowed, the air is filtered very well. I never saw a slot machine pay out in all the times I travelled through. Maybe it was just me??? I enjoyed the place. But for the price, the attention to the details should have been much better. I would stay again, but I would have to get a much better price."

The location may be its weakest point--to get to other hotels, you must either take a monorail or a taxi cab, whereas at other hotels it is possible to walk from place to place. The rooms are clean, though dated as far as rooms in Vegas go. At this price point, they need to get rid of the vinyl bed covers and get some plasma televisions. The bathrooms, however, were a nice surprise, with separate tub and shower and a separate room for the toilet. With a soft makeover, these rooms could be much better. The views from our one bedroom suite were fantastic. The capacious casino definitely has high minimums across the board. On Saturday night of our stay, the Blackjack tables were $50 or higher. The selection of restaurants is not as enticing as, say, the Wynn or MGM Grand. Mandalay would do well to modernize their offerings. The pool is definitely the strongest point of this casino resort. It was quite a scene, though there seemed to be chairs and towels for all. For the money, there are better places to stay in Vegas."

The bathroom, w/ a jacuzzi tub was very nice and a great way to relax after busy days. Overall, a very nice hotel but everything was quite pricey. The breakfast buffet had a very nice selection of food; but quite honestly, we felt the Luxor breakfast buffet was better. The tram between Mandalay and Luxor/Excalibur was great (ran frequently; never had to wait more than a few minutes). If you like rum and food w/ a Carribean/South American tilt (but you can still get salads and burgers as well), check out Rumjungle (just off the casino) - not inexpensive, but the food, drink, and great service are worth it! We definitely enjoyed our stay, but given the original room and issues w/ the tv (an inconvenience, but frustrating), I didn't think we got a commensurate amount of value for the price paid."

Check in is at 3PM, it was noon and the friendly Doorman/Bellman took my bags and suggested I go directly to the front desk as early check in might be available. There, I was met by smiling, helpful Mirjana who checked me right in for my 3 night stay. She gave me helpful hotel information and directed me to the right set of elevators. My room had a great view, was beautiful & clean and we nicknamed our pillow-topped bed \"Cloud Nine\". The new decor is gorgeous and worthy of being on the cover of the best designer magazine. The bathroom has whirlpool gigantic tub/large shower & toilet in it's own closet. There is a flat screen TV between the double sinks in perfect view of the tub. There is a large flat screened TV mounted on the wall across from the bed. I thought there would be robes provided so I did not pack one. After noticing that there were none, I called housekeeping and they sent some right up and wanted to know if there was anything else I needed. They were soooo nice! As long as we put the \"relaxation/recovering\" sign out, no one knocked on our door. One day I forgot to bring the sign in and when we returned late that afternoon, housekeeping called and said they noticed the sign out all day and was just wondering if there was anything I needed, did I want the room cleaned, did I need new towels etc. Very Nice! Service by every employee I encountered was excellent, courteous & friendly. In-room menu, food and service was excellent! All was delivered quickly, in sterno warmed cabinets. YUM! Our groups last night function was excellent and it seemed there was a friendly server for each guest. Each food station and bar were manned by friendly, smiling staff. The eateries are excellent, all staffed by smiling, friendly & polite employees. There is something for everyone, from coffee shop and fast food to the best gormet places around!! Don't miss the \"Ice Bar\" at Red Square. The casino is lively with several inviting bars with great entertainment......all kinds for all ages. IWe had a rental car, self parking is a long walk but we felt safe. This was my 2nd stay at Mandalay Bay. I stayed at Bellagio twice also. It is gorgeous and is better located but is not anywhere as welcoming and friendly as Mandalay Bay. I will be back!"

Separate tub/shower with toilet in a room by itself. Bathrooms were beautiful as was the entire room. Food was excellent but pricey. Shark reef was overpriced but if combined with the dinner buffet, it was reasonable. Everything seemed to be a long walk, but with the free tram to Excalibur, it was not bad. Don't miss Momma Mia. Terrific show! I would stay here again at this price. This is a beautiful hotel/casino. Everyone on the staff was friendly and helpful, from the lady at check-in (no waiting) to the bellhop when leaving."

    "content": "The Mandalay Bay is a fairly nice place to stay if you never have to sleep in your bed. Their mattresses are about the worst ever. I've stayed in discount hotels that have better beds. You can feel the metal springs with every move. And they call themselves a four star hotel? The rooms are also getting a bit banged up too. The room I stayed in must have had some rough parties, as the doors had lots of scratches and dings in it. Other than that, the bathrooms are very nice, and housekeeping is excellent. Their pools are closed and seem to be under constant contruction during the winter seasons - at least the last two times I've had to attend a convention there. From a convenience standpoint: very close to the airport, but you have to travel a lot to see the rest of the Strip. Also, if you attend a convention be aware that it can take 15 minutes from your room to the hotel's convention center. But having to walk a lot is pretty standard for Vegas."

This room wasn't much better so I went to the front desk to change it - much quicker and got the result we wanted. We didn't get chance to use many of the hotel facilities - too busy shopping and sightseeing in Vegas. We did go down to the beach, which is OK for a man made beach resort! Had breakfast in one of the hotel restaurants and didn't need to eat for the rest of the day - says it all about American breakfasts!"

The halls look fresh with new carpet also. The front desk said the first 12 floors are completed on the remodel and the remainder should be complete by August 2007. The hotel has a nice ambience and the pools are great for the kids. The main pool areas are being reconstructed and are supposed to be completed by March. I've stayed at all the large resorts on the Strip, but the 11 acre pool complex here is the best in Vegas. Wave pool, lazy river, sandy beach and multiple pools. Very nice hotel. If you're price contious, be sure to check their website often, as their room prices often drop and you can request the lower rate if you call before arrival."

    "content": "I had my wedding at Mandalay Bay during the NBA allstar weekend. We stayed for 5 nights, and for the first night our honeymoon suite was on a high floor but was in an older room. The first room was decent sized with a large bathroom, but the furniture and bed were very worn. On our second day there we moved into a newly refurbished room. That room (also a honeymoon suite, same price) was spectacular. In that room there was beautiful modern furniture and decor, a plasma tv, an lcd tv in the bathroom, and most importantly an extremely comfortable bed. We had a party in our room after the wedding and the room accommodated 20 people comfortably. I would suggest requesting a remodeled room as they are FAR superior to the other rooms. The hotel staff told me that so far only floors 10 and below have been remodeled. Also, if view is a concern I would not recommend a honeymoon suite as those rooms only have a partial window in the room. Front desk service, bell service, room service, and valet service were all excellent. The only gripe that I had about service was with security (I will touch upon that later). The common areas at mandalay bay are superb. There are many good dining options. The Shanghai Lilly restaurant was outstanding, and was perhaps the best meal that I have ever eaten. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Tratorria Del Lupo was also very good. Burger Bar was very good. Mix restaurant had good food, but the price is very high (expect a $400 check for 2 people). I had the breakfast buffet a couple of times and it was good although not quite on par with the Wynn or Bellagio buffets. The food from the cafe and from room service was also very good. The Mix lounge was a nice, upscale bar with a spectacular view of the strip. The Rumjungle was a different story. Throughout the weekend they had special nba allstar events and it was pure chaos. There were huge crowds of people standing in front of the club, but most weren't even trying to get in and were just standing there listening to the music for free. There was nothing even resembling a line, and the supposed \"vip entry for hotel guests\" did not happen. On one night when we tried to go there the security had obviously lost control of the situation and they actually started shoving people (including my brother and I). I was very disappointed with how that club handled the busy weekend. The wedding ceremony was beautiful and the chapel did a great job. Our wedding was high class and definitely not some kind of cheesy ceremony that one might expect in vegas. The biggest negative of our stay was the crowds on all-star weekend. The Mandalay Bay hosted the \"NBA jam session\" which was open to the public. That seemed to bring in a lot of people who were not going to gamble or spend money atthe hotel. Drink service was virtually non existent, as every bar was filled with people who werent playing the machines, and there were large numbers of people lounging in the slot areas who were not gambling (causing the waitresses to avoid the area). The table minimums were also very high during the weekends. I had to do most of my gambling elsewhere. Despite the huge crowds I had an excellent trip overall and would highly recommend Mandalay Bay to other travelers."

We had dinner at Aureole- A bit spendy, but excellent service, and excellent food Our overall experience was good, but we were not aware of the massive construction/remodeling of the majority of the pool areas which made them unavailable to use. Yes it is winter time, but they do advertise having heated pools, and we didn't catch the \"closed for construction\" notices.. which may have affected our decision on where to stay"

    "content": "went to vegas last weekend (weekend after super bowl and before magic and all star weekend). i booked the hotel a month out, and started to read reviews closer to trip time. needless to say after seeing what the others here had to say, i had a lot of concerns. i originally got an ok rate (booked through the hotel, but same rate on other sites). being slightly OCD, i kept checking the hotel website as well as other travel sites and the rate dropped four times. the hotel was very accommodating as far as making the adjustments each time i called in. by the time we checked in for our trip we saved about a hundred bucks. so stay on top of your rates, because as other have stated here they overpaid and the rates that i've seen would not have been worth it. don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful hotel. But for the price i originally booked, we could have upgraded to the a suite for the same price. We took the lesser room and $100 to play with. the grounds and hotel are gorgeous! the fish and tropical decor are wonderful! upon check in we were offered one of the newly renovated rooms, unfortunately on a lower floor, but the front desk agent assured us that it was nicer than the older rooms. so we gambled on that, and won! the room was great, extremely comfortable, the bed, the sofa, and chaise. there's a channel on the tv's called \"shark vision,\" which is a camera w/in the massive aquarium. it was so nice to have 2 fabulous flat screen aquariums in our room and bathroom, (we left the tvs tuned to 'sharkvision' ), very soothing :) the bathroom was nice with a roomy shower (being of taller stature this is a very nice perk). traveling with a, let's just say, 'not as neat as i' companion, the separate closets were a HUGE plus!!! the bed was very cozy. the only down sides to the room were the walls are EXTREMELY thin (sounded like the gentleman next door was sharing our room) and the view was the absolute worst i've EVER seen. we didn't have the hallway noise that i've read in other reviews. there was a pretty thick carpet, so we didn't hear much outside of the room other than our neighbor. the hotel is packed with restaurant/club/bar options, it was so nice to have so many happening things at our fingertips. we didn't need to leave the hotel at all other than wanting to explore. The casino floor is spacious with a good selection of games and the air wasn\u2019t over the top with smoke at all. i went for my birthday and booked dinner at RED SQUARE through the concierge. i thought all was fine, until we showed up and there were no reservations!!! the restaurant was very accommodating and fit us in w/in the blink of an eye with no problem/hassle, they were super. our waiter was the absolute best!! the food is FAB! the lobster bisques is fantastic, the siberian nachos are great, and the tuna tar tare was excellent. the roquefort crusted filet mignon was delicious and the martinis are first-rate!!!!! i wished i wasn't slightly queasy from all the drinks during the day, because i could have gotten lost in the drink menu. i highly recommend it, and will dine there again! the highlight of the trip was without a doubt, shark reek! we visited after dinner, and it was a perfect way to cap off a very active and draining day. the exhibit/aquarium is ABSOLUTLEY MAGNIFICENT!!!!!! it's stunning, you go at your own pace, so we lingered a while\u2026 i'm glad we went late (close to closing), because it was almost empty. we leisurely strolled through the entire exhibit, checking out the amazing species of fish, and petting rays...so awesome! i enjoyed mandalay and would recommend it! not sure if i'd stay there again right away, only because there are other hotels that i'd like to try out, such as the venetian and bellagio...but it's definitely up there! missing the sharks, ~heavenlyberries~"

The Four Seasons in connected to the Mandalay Bay \u2026 which has as wonderful spa (if you have time / money / interest). Another positive note ... when I forgot my beautiful dress in the closet, they mailed it to me, free of charge. The service was really impeccable. The Shark Reef was disappointing, it was over-hyped and underwhelming \u2026 save your money for a real zoo. Other negative notes: internet access is not readily available; \"regular\" chow is a bit hard to come by late at night; hotel is located further south on the strip, which certainly isn\u2019t nearly as glitzy and glamorous (but you\u2019re still within walking distance to everything).

Here's the rundown -- The place is clean. The service is good. The room was clean. However, the bed was awful. It was way too hard and the pillows too soft. I was later told that casino hotels do that to keep you up at night and on the casino floor instead of sleeping. No DVD or CD player. No mini bar -- guess they want you to spend your money in the shops below, which just happen to face the casino! Few bath amenities. The walk to your hotel room or anywhere else can be a hike -- be prepared to have spare shoes available instead of just pumps. The restaurants below are very good -- excellent. I ate at Aureole and the service and food was first class wonderful. The Noodle Shop had great service but the price wasn't worth it for the food -- just average Chinese buffet food. The walls between rooms are too thin -- I heard everything I didn't want to hear next door at 3 AM (if you get the idea)! The sound in the hallways also echos into the rooms because of the tile. Unless you are there to gamble away and don't care about your room, look elsewhere for some back-to-the-room comfort."

My hubby and i, went to vegas for our fist time December 2005, after speaking to our friends they hightly recommended Mandalay Bay and thats where we stayed for 3 nights. We hade a regular room facing the mountains, the view was positively gorgeous! on our last day i pulled the curtains open to discover a hot air balloon in the distance, how awesome was that???? We also had a view of the side of the luxor and the Rio in the distance. Ok, on with the room, it was great and spacious, bathroom was nice and big, great tub and stand up shower, i brought some candles and bubble bath with me and layed it out, the next morning they left me some bath salt, which i thought was really nice, the room was clean no complaints, pleanty of closet space, we each had our own, YAY! The only bad thing i can say is when you opend the shower door, you thought it was gonna fall off, it was showing ALOT of wear, the handle on the outside of the door was no longer even gold, and it made a hideous noise when opend, but thats the only bad thing. Unfortunately being that it was December we werent able to take advantage of there amazing wave pool but we did take a walk around and the grounds, again...GORGEOUS! I would recommend this hotel but only if you wanted to remain there most of the time, it was way at the end of the strip, it seemed by itself, we walked everywhere our calves were hurting after one day, LOL. We only took in one show and it was Cirque du Soleil-Mystere it was very funny. We ate @ the Burger Bar (not sure thats the name) in Mandalay Place, you can litirally have your burger ANYWAY you want it! they even have lobster burgers, this place is definately worth a try! We also ate at Postrio @ the Venetian, we had a great dinner there as well, we sat outside in the piazza in the action so it was great! We also had dinner at Kahunaville in TI that was fun, its basicall just junk bar food, lots of fried stuff but the bartenders were amazing each corner of the bar had a flairing bartneder, they were all extremely talented, i actually saw 2 of them on a Food Network special on flaring competitions! Alot of the free attractions were not working at this time of year and there was hardley anybody around, we spoke to a bartender that said that the 2 weeks b/4 christmas are the slowest, which has its advantages and disadvantages. The TI Sirens show wasnt working, the Volcano at the Mirage wasnt working, but the fountains at the Bellagio were, HOW AMAZING, when it starts it seems like the entire strip just stops to look, its truley awesome! I will be going back this June, so i will make sure and post my review as soon as i get back so that nothing slips my mind! Thanx for reading!"

Alas, the rest of the room did not come up to the bathroom's standard: bed whose comfort compared to a Motel 6's, 1990's vintage TV, only 1 comfortable chair, and skimpy blackout curtain. Reveille was enforced by loud hotel staff in the hallway at 9 AM. We were here for a research meeting; convention facilities were adequate, though meeting rooms were a 15-minute hike from the hotel, and the signage was confusing and misleading.

First the good; for a first class hotel, it had good service and food at the two retaurants where we ate, the restaurants Rumjungle and JPOP sushi. Servers were friendly and efficient and the food was better than most hotel restaurants. Now the bad; the rooms were sadly lacking in basic amenities. We paid over $270 per night for two nights and had no robes, minibar, or CD/DVD player in the room. The drapes and bedding were holdovers from at least a decade earlier with faded garish tropical flowers. The nicest thing I can say about the room was that is was clean. There was also only one trash can in the bathroom and we filled it to overflowing with the soda cans we drank in one day. Maid service was very efficient and probably the best I have encountered for security (asking for a room key check at the door to verify we were the guests in that room because we walked in as she was cleaning). We went for a convention and received a \"view\" room which was of the pool under renovation/maintenance. Walls were not thick enough between the hallways and rooms because we heard every conversation anyone had in the hallway. We reported broken glass in our hallway and had to direct the cleaning crew to the spot even though we had told them exactly where it was located. Upon checking out we saw that a charge had been added for two bottles of water we never drank. The front desk clerk replied that \"That happens alot, we'll take it off.\" We wondered how many guests don't notice the charge and pay for bottles they did not drink. Overall I would only come back to eat in one of the restaurants. This hotel is not worth it if you want spacious rooms with modern and thoughtful amenities. I would recommend either the Wynn or the Bellagio for a truly pleasant and good hotel stay."

The girls at the reception desk were so pleasant and extremely helpful and accomodating. I was given a choice of which room I preferred, Strip or pool view, smoking, non-smoking, and whether I wanted a room up high. I was also told that if I was not satisfied with the room I could return to reception where I would be transferred to a more suitable room. At the Luxor when I requested another room the staff were unhelpful and rude. The room was very clean and extemely spacious. The bathrooms were particularly luxurious and again spotlessly clean. The Spa was just heaven on earth and I reccomend a visit to any one who enjoys a good pampering. Well worth the time and money. The beach pool area amazed me. If I closed my eyes it was like sitting on a real beach with the sound of waves and the spray from the pool. When I was there the pool was not at all crowded. I would fully reccomend this hotel to everyone, in fact I have already reccomened it to everyone I know. Go there you will not regeret it."

    "content": "We stayed at this hotel for my 40th birthday for 5 nights 7/19 - 24th of 2006. My first impression of the hotel was WOW - cant wait to see the rest and really settle in. It was very big and It took me 3 days to see everything - this was my first time to vegas so I am better prepared now for future with what to expect etc etc. Originally we were booked into a room at The Hotel because my father had us upgraded from a regular hotel room as a gift but I wanted to stay inside the main hotel so we were accomodated before we even arrived and put into a 1 bedroom suite that they must use for casino comps - I think they call it the Mandalay Bay Suite. The room was on the 60th floor and boy was it great. It was at least a 1000 S.F. and had a bar area, hall bath, large living area and the bedroom was huge with a large bathroom with soaking tub and seperate shower. The real suprise was the breathtaking view we had in full floor to ceiling windows in both areas of the suite. The view was directly up the midle of the strip - ohh it was great.. epecially at night. Now for those of you who would like the view and not the bigger suite as a room they do have regular rooms on this floor - i know for a fact because upon arrival they upgraded my best friend and her husband onto the same floor only in a regular room so that we were all on the same floor together. You get the better grade of bathroom products with this room as well. The extra attention to detail was evident in the housekeeping service, turndown service and just nicer accomodations in general. we even had our own seperate elevator bank for the top floors we were on and they were just off the casino floor which was nice. I am not sure though that I would pay 4-500 a night for this room or stay at Mandalay Bay again. The room was the nicest part of the experience for me - the service was not personal at all - in anyway mind you except for when I had to call down for something and they answered the phone Yes Mrs. so-in-so. The Casino was beautiful but not laid back and although within the first 30 hours of being there I hit on a couple of slots for a few grand the machines were kind of tight the rest of the time we played there. Blackjack was a hassle for my husband to find a spot at the peak times as with all the casinos but we did end up doing most of our gambling off the property at other casinos. Freemont Street had a few and they were loose. On the night of my birthday we saw Elton Johns Red Piano at Caesars and it was fantastic as was Mystere at TI a few nights before. I highly reccomend both shows. Mystere was a feast for our eyes and Red Piano was so special having grown up on all of his music - it was a real treat. After Red Piano we went back to THe Hotel @ Mandalay Bay and had dinner upstairs at the MIX restaurant. it was delicious but beware that if you are hungry you will not get full here... the portions are extremely small. The service was very attentive but I think the restaurant itself lacked a romantic atmosphere which was what I truly wanted. I am just not sure if 3 drinks 2 appetizers and 2 main courses should have been around $200. We are definilty not thrifty when it comes to a good meal but I just dont know if it was worth the price tag. I did not love it at all. It was a very contemporary environment - sterile looking if you will.... and I will not go back. We had dinner at the Palms steak house at Caesars and that meal was by far better to me - the steaks were perfect and it was less money. The Raffles 24 hour restaurant off the Casino floor was good.... the sliced steak sandwhich was about 20 bucks but it was huge and delicious - 2 people can share.....Breakfast buffet off casino floor very good and worth the money..long lines that move fast - they had breakfast stuff, lunch and dinner items - very good, fresh and they have servers for you drinks and coffee refills. Also the Border restaurant was excellent for Mexican and House of Blues food was good but so super busy that the service was so-so. The pool area was packed and we did not goto swim - we lived in Florida at the time of this trip and did not go to Vegas to sunbathe. Sharkreef for the kids - dont waste your money or time if you dont have kids..... We are planning to go back to Vegas and are going to try something more mid strip this time - anyone who can recommend something to me feel free to email. jfindest@comcast.net We want a nice property with better han above average amenities and a little smaller resort would work... I am staying away from Caesars - its too big for me to stay in and the Venetain and Bellagio look good but I am truly considering TI or the Mirage.. I welcome your replys......and or questions about Vegas....."

    "content": "We stayed at Mandalay Bay between Christmas and New Year, and loved it. We were on a high floor at the end of the corridor, and found it very quiet (even being on the airport side), although the people we travelled with had noisy neighbours. They complained and got a $50 restaurant credit. Regarding the previous reviewers comments on long walk from the self park and long queues at check in, in my experience most Vegas hotels have the same problem - the hotels are all so huge it's not surprising! Our room was clean, and didn't seem at all dated to us. We found the bed very comfotable. We had the buffet breakfast every day which was very good value. That was the only restaurant we tried in MB. We managed to get on the guest list for the House of Blues Foundation Room which was great and had fabulous strip views. Apart from Mandalay Bay, we also went to the Playboy Club which was fun, Voodoo Lounge and Ghostbar which are both cool with great views, and Love which is brilliant - and I'm not a fan of Cirque du soleil!"

    "content": "My first trip to Vegas was a short visit and I was there for a relative's wedding. When we arrived at the hotel, we passed up Valet parking and went to self park. With our luggage in tow, we walked what felt like miles to the check-in desks. We wished we had valet parked. Check-in was about a 20 minute process and seemed very slow. However, as it was my first time in Vegas, I was overwhelmed by the massiveness of the hotel and didn't quite seem to notice at the time how long the process was. Our first room was dirty and was overlooking the airport. So not what I expected. We were far away from the others in the wedding party even though we all requested to be together. We complained and were moved to a room with an amazing view of the strip! The room itself was just OK - linens were dingy, bathroom fixtures/hardware were worn away. I will agree with some other reviews that the beds were uncomfortable. I didn't get a good nights rest either of the 2 nights I was there. The restaurants were great! We ate at Red, White and Blue for lunch and everything was superb. We also ate at China Grill and the food was amazing. We ate very family style - there was 7 of us and we shared about 8 plates of food. The wild mushroom pasta was delicious as were the wasabi mashed potatoes. We ate at Raffles for breakfast one day and the omlette's were just right. Room service was really good too. Lastly, with 2 Starbucks at either end of the property, I was in heaven! The wedding was held in MB's chapel and the service was just lovely. The dinner reception for 20 people was held at the adjoining Four Seasons Hotel at the Charlie Palmer Steakhouse. The food and service was incredible. The attention to detail throughout wine/dinner service was impeccable. The casino at MB was very nice. The only other hotel I ventured to was the Luxor and I didn't like their casino at all. So I went back to MB to play Craps and the dealers were very friendly and gave advice when asked (I know they have to, but I've encountered some rude dealers at other casinos when asked for advice). A friend and I played at one table for about 3 hours and had a great time, and some of that was due to the friendly dealers at our table. The cocktail waitresses were very attentive if you give them a tip the first time they come by - I had one woman practically bring me a drink every time she went to the bar! It pays to tip well, I suppose. But it is Vegas afterall. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at the Mandalay Bay."

    "content": "After reading some of the reviews I was nervous about our choice of the Mandalay Bay Resort . But when we got there check-in only took a few minutes. Staff was helpful, courteous and friendly (throughout our whole stay). We had a lovely room with floor to ceiling window overlooking the Strip from the 15th floor. We only planned on being there for 3 days - then our flight back to Denver got cancelled due to snow and we decided to stay through New Year's. The hotel encouraged us to see if we could get a better extended deal online as opposed to their rates! I signed up for the spa 5 day package which only comes to $17 per day - includes unlimited exercise room and soaking pools - lovely luxury (they even have coffee, juice and muffins in the AM -at least on the women's side - and unlimited towels, cozy robes, free use of lotions and hair products). Enjoyed the casino - husband did poker, I did penny slots and won. It was much more elegant and less noisy than many other casinos. Restaurants were pricey but we never had a bad meal and sometimes just ended up sharing a tuna and potato salad sandwich (delicious from Red, White & Blue) in our room. As it was New Year's people from all over the world were there and it was quite exciting. Despite the crowds, housekeeping was always quickly responsive (eg when they forgot to give us hand towels) and courteous. I'd stay there again in a minute!! Be prepared to walk alot though. Hallways can be long - depending where your room is - and the casinos are large. P.S. We walked over to visit The Hotel and felt it was dark and quite stark, and were glad we were not staying there"

We visited most other hotels on the strip and always felt that we were home when we came back to Mandalay. So it is a bit far away from most of the action on the Strip, but that's not such a bad thing. There is something to do, drink and eat 24/7. It is spotlessly clean and the staff work very hard. Our room wasn't ready after our 16 hour journey and they immediately put a $50 credit on our room bill and said to go and have a meal on them. So we did. The room was a trek from the lifts but had a great view, was spacious, clean and comfortable. There is a great mix of people of all ages and backgrounds. The variety of restaurants is amazing. This is a true mega resort and if you liked who was playing in the concert arena, then a lot of the time you wouldn't need to venture out too far. The spa is beautiful and the staff friendly and informative. We used the tram over to Excalibur a lot and it ran conveniently 24 hours a day, handy when you are coming home from a serious night out at 4am. Even then, you could could go to Raffles and get a burger or whatever you wanted. Everything is so convenient. We loved it here and compared to other hotels had a good feeling of space and realative peace. It didn't seem run down or dowdy either."

    "content": "My husband and two adult children (ages 21 and 25) chose Mandalay Bay to celebrate our family Christmas of 2006- thinking this would be a great place/hotel to celebrate Christmas. We reserved a 2 bedroom suite, which I booked directly through Mandalay Bay. The elevators at Mandalay Bay were always congested. Kids ran up and down our hallway unsupervised.The suite was absolutely fiflthy, the furniture was old, wore out and mismatched. The carpet was full of stains and cigarette burns yet this suite was suppose to be a non smoking suite. The faucets in the bathroom did not turn on and off correctly. The furniture had trash in the cushions. Hot water was very limited . The same room service dishes were sitting in the same place in the hallway for at least 2 days. When I spoke to a representative about the condition of the room her response was that \"the hotel was doing renovations and when we come back next year all the rooms will be like new\" - Our suite was not inexpensive and I do feel that when I made reservations , since it was directly through the hotel, that I should have been informed of the \"renovations\" and the present condition of the suite. The amenities in the bathroom were limited. Waitresses were hard to find in the casino. We waited a long time in line at one of the restaurants and listened to the maitre'd talk about how staff didnt show up for work - then, we were seated with four dirty tables around us and the staff acted like they were doing us a favor. The service at the buffet was limited, food was not replenished in a timely fashion - if it was replenished at all. Smiles on staff were hard to find. I could go on and on. Staying here was a huge disappointment and based on this experience I would never recommend staying here."

Nothing has been changed since our last stay. The carpet in the bedroom was stained - badly. The door to the toilet closet was broken (wooden slats and one was knocked out and sort of put back in). The windows had duct tape along the bottom of all 3 - we were afriad maybe they'd fall out if we removed it! The light outside our room was broken - not burned out, the glass was broken from the cover of the wall sconce. The scent they pump into the casino was a bit much and this was really the only hotel I could smell it in. Our room wasn't cleaned until after 4pm any day we were there...not that big of a deal but when you're out for 6+ hours its a little bit of a hassle to be put out of your room for at least 15 minutes if you want it cleaned. Right now, I'd put it on par with the Flamingo in terms of cleanliness - definately not worth the price anymore!"

We were NOT happy with the bed - very uncomfortable or the room. We had a non-smoking room, but it reeked of smoke, and we complained that our room was noisy (ask NOT to be on the landing strip of Vegas airport) and we were never moved. I do not think we'd go back to Mandalay to stay, but definitely to gamble. If we did, we'd definitely request no landing strip. You could get an awesome view of the mountains."

Check in and check out: smooth and efficient Casino: Nice but not particularly special Room - nice size, but lacking amenities and character Cons: Room service was slow; food was sometimes cold. No honor bar and no large bath towels nor were there any robes ( at least not in the regular hotel. I didn't stay in THEhotel nor the Ritz Carlton) Bathtub had hair in it when we checked in and the same hair in it when we left. Needless to say, we didn't use the bathtub.

We also didn't find anything about what was going on in Vegas in the hotel. I think they want you to strictly stay in the vicinity of hotels owned by them. The rooms were clean and we had a good view on the 17th floor. The doors require you to slam them in order for them to shut. This is disturbing at 2am when a lot of people are coming home from the nightclubs. We were also near the service elevator which is blocked from view by two doors. Since service goes on all night, there was a constant slamming of the doors that woke us up. Food in the hotel is disappointing. The casino is pretty good and it doesn't seem incredibly smokey like a lot of Vegas hotels. I doubt we'll stay again mainly due to the location but also due to the amount of noise from the doors slamming."

Having read recent reviews, we were a bit apprehensive, but we booked because we had enjoyed it several times in the past. Thankfully, Mandalay Bay did not disappoint. We used self-parking because we knew from experience that it is easier. Check-in was quick and courteous, and we received a suite upgrade. The suite and bath were both nice and clean, and we had an amazing view of the strip. We did realize the decor had not changed in years, but we had been told at check-in that they were renovating in 2007, The staff was wonderful, and housekeeping was performed between 10 and noon every day. Towels were white and appeared fairly new. I love their amenities. We did not eat at any hotel restaurants except the buffet (for breakfast) and Burger Bar this trip, but have enjoyed other hotel restaurants previously. The buffet is good for breakfast - decent selection and well-prepared, although not overly exotic. The Burger Bar food was as expected, but our server was pretty slack. At this time of year, only the South Lagoon pool remained open. They were adding to the Lazy River area, I think. When open, the beach and larger pool area are a bit nicer. (They also usually come with more children, unfortunately.) The airport traffic is only annoying if you let it bother you. My only (minor) complaint is a lack of sufficient parking deck elevators. The main elevator banks to the rooms can also become pretty crowded during busy periods. Check-out was busy but painless, with incredibly friendly service. Like any large casino hotel in Vegas, you will walk a lot. If you mind that, perhaps you should look at a smaller hotel. Mandalay Bay is on the extreme south end of the strip and some reviewers have complained about the distance from the \"action.\" Again, if you prefer to be in the middle of everything, you should stay at another hotel. I look forward to our next stay at Mandalay Bay."

    "content": "On August 13, 2006 several family members and I planned to take a vacation to Las Vegas on November 7 \u2013 November 11, 2006. After exploring the Internet, we decided to book on what appeared to be a good deal through US Airways vacations. The timing was right and we were looking forward to visiting Las Vegas for the first time and also staying at the Mandalay Bay which we had heard was top notch. Our trip from our home base in Newark, New Jersey was problem free. Once we landed in Las Vegas and arrived at Mandalay Bay\u2019s front desk at approximately 12 AM, our trip took an unpleasant turn. Keep in mind it was now 3:00 AM Eastern Time, and we were looking forward to checking in, getting some rest and starting our adventure early the next morning. Matt welcomed us at the front desk and advised us that he did not have three rooms on the same floor. I had called to confirm with this specific request on Sunday 08/20 and once again on Sunday 11/5 and spoke directly to Tony at the hotel. I wanted to be sure that we would be on the same floor as we were traveling with our mother, Amelia who is 84 years old. We did not want her to be on a floor far away from us in case of any emergencies. Matt informed us that he didn\u2019t have any rooms available for us. Although we understand that rooms are not guaranteed, and that the hotel\u2019s only obligation was to find us comparable rooms (any where for that matter), he nevertheless offered us the 3-bed room suite with the provision that we had to be out of it by 1 PM the following day. He also assured us that since he was working until the morning, he would be following the situation for the duration of his shift and would follow up with the morning supervisor to ensure a smooth transition of rooms. Although a nice gesture, we would have preferred our standard rooms rather than the inconvenience of wasting our limited time to accommodate Mandalay Bay\u2019s problem. At this time he also offered us a $50 credit to our accounts. We then realized that once we were out of the suite, there was no guarantee that there would be rooms available, and, why should we, in essence, move our luggage, check out and then check back in again. We were also told that we could not leave our luggage in the suite and transfer them directly into our new rooms. Needless to say, we were tired, disappointed and aggravated. We now had to pack up the next morning, be back in the lobby by 1 PM, thus postponing and canceling some items we had planned on our itinerary for that day. At any rate, we had no other option than to stayed in the suite that night. We returned to the front desk somewhere around 12 PM the next day. At this time we were told that our rooms were not ready, nor were we given a time when they would be ready. But we were given the promise that we would be given priority to get us into our rooms. . We spoke with a Janet and then moved on to the supervisor whose name was Mary Jangiello, she apologized and told us that she would look into it and that we could have another $50 credit to our account. She was able to assign one room on the 19th Floor and suggested we put all our luggage in there and wait for the other 2 rooms as they become available. She assured us that she would put a rush on cleaning the rooms. We grudgingly did this and spent the next two hours waiting for the other rooms. Bear in mind that our entire morning schedule was placed on hold in order to wait for our rooms. About 2:30 PM, we went back to the front desk to check on the status and were told Mary was out to lunch. At no point in time were we informed of the status or how much longer until we can check into our new rooms. This is when we spoke with Anna Stafford Heckman. She apologized profusely for the situation sympathizing with our loss of precious time. My sister Joanne mentioned that this was her wedding anniversary, and it was turning out to be a pretty lousy way to spend it especially with our plans sidelined by this total communication breakdown at the front desk. I am sure that room reassignments is a common practice in the hotel industry but there does not appear to be a procedure in place to take care of stranded guests. I would expect this service in a lesser hotel but certainly not one that is AAA approved, with four-diamond rating like the Mandalay Bay. She then offered us $50 credit. We now assumed that we had a credit for $150, $50 from Matt, $50 from Mary, and now her $50. This was not the case. Apparently, one of them did not add the $50 they had promised. Anna did what she could and found us three rooms on the 18th Floor. And now, all of us has to move our luggage and relocated for the third time in the same day from the 19th floor to the 18th. We all felt like nomads and settled in to our new accommodations, which turned out to be less than expected. By now, our entire day was ruined and no one was excited about being in Las Vegas anymore. Fast forward to later that same day my sister Joanne received a bottle of champagne from Anna to assuage our annoyance at the inconvenience we had been through. My mother Amelia and my husband and I received a complimentary fruit basket. Imagine our surprise on Friday, November 10, 2006 when my sister Joanne checked her room bill and saw that there was a $60.11 charge for champagne as well as a $100 charge for the credit we had used at Lupo restaurant. She called the desk and was advised that these would be wiped out at check out. At this point, we were all was pretty sure that would not happen smoothly either. I also checked my room charges and found a $100 charge for the restaurant. At check out on Saturday, November 11, Janet asked me if I would like to put the $100 charge on my credit card. My sister was also asked if she wanted to put the 160.11 on her charge. This was the proverbial straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. We explained the situation with the credits and requested that all our accounts be balanced out to $0. This was accomplished with the help of yet another front desk \u201cmanager\u201d. We also had to request a copy of the bill showing the zero (0) balance just in case something else came up. It was here that we ended our stay at Mandalay Bay on the same sour note that it started on. The front desk had a major communication and customer service malfunction, which, unfortunately, we were the victims. Imaging receiving a \u201cgratis\u201d bottle of champagne for our aggravation, and then aggravating us even more by asking us to pay for it. We had recently lost our father and we had been looking forward to this vacation with the thought that this would be a perfect place to get away especially for my mom. I would also like to add the fact that we had booked through US Airway and were made to feel a bit like second-class citizens. We were told at every turn that we had not booked directly with the hotel and had to seek recourse through the travel agent. Although the front line employees and managers of Mandalay Bay had offered pretty much their \u201cstandard\u201d customer service spiel, we were all disappointed that there was no accountability from anyone at Manadalay Bay. I am sure that there are many positive reports from your customers but sadly; we cannot say that we fall into that category. I truly doubt that my family or I will book through US Airways again and will most definitely not return to Mandalay Bay."

Being Las Vegas, the quickest way to get from point A to point B in the hotel is thorugh the casino. The room wasn't too expensive...there for a convention but they charge you for EVERYTHING. A toll-FREE call from the room was $1 (for the first 30 minutes), Internet access (wired or wireless) was $12/day, no coffee maker in the room, $4.95 for a liter of bottled water --- it got to the point where I expected to find a meter on the flush handle for the toilet. Like all Vegas strip hotels it's huge -- it seemed like it was a 1/2 mile from the elevator to the room. The Bayside Buffet was excellent ($15 for breakfast, $16 for lunch, and $20 for dinner). --- lots of meats, hot food, peeled cooked shrimp, Chinese, Mexican, American, Japanese, and European foods --- all at once -- as much as you want --- excellent quality.. Most reasonable restaurant seemed to be the House of Blues -- if you buy a dinner and bring back the recipt at breakfast you get 1 entree free for a couple."

Also, the pools are nice but the place is extremely noisy due to overflying helicopters from McCarran that is across the street. I don't think the pools were relaxing at all due to the constant nosie. And of course, all the Europeans smoke at the pool so it is a good idea to sit upwind of them unless you like to get balefuls of secondhand smoke. Overall, the Mandalay Bay is nice but dated, and hopefully, now that it was bought by MGM, that they will dump some money into it for needed rennovations."

The pool area was gorgeous and very inviting. the fact that you could travel to the Luxor and Excaliber without even going outside was nice but I would prefer to stay somewhere in the middle of the strip, as the Mandaly Bay is at the very end."

As I live in Las Vegas, I take the opportunity to stay at many of the hotels as a relaxing getaway. The hotel as at its lowest occupancy rate of the year, and registration upgraded me to the Mandalay Suite. After brief confusion finding the elevator to my room, I asked a security officer how to find the elevator to the 62nd floor. He explained that there is a private elevator lobby for the 60-62 floors, and assisted me to the suite. What a wonderful staff! The suite was absolutely beautiful and had an excellent view of the Las Vegas Strip. In fact, I was only one floor below the House of Blues Foundation Room, which is at the top of the Mandalay Bay (also excellent, but that's another review). Overall, I would highly recommend the Mandalay Bay hotel, and recommend booking a suite level room."

The choice of restaurants on the property is remarkable and all offer high value for your dollar. The Four Seasons adjoins Mandalay Bay so you can walk over to Charlie Palmer's Steak House, which I highly recommend. The pool area offers you a sandy beach, a huge wave pool, a \"lazy river,\" or a more secluded pool area. Just don't drink the $5 bottled water in the room. It adds up!"

Between 6-8 pm, the wait sometimes exceeded 45 minutes. This is no exaggeration. Using the stairs was not an option since we were on the 23rd floor and I have a bad knee. The elevators kept getting stuck with people in them. the rooms are in desperate need of refurnishing. the carpets and furniture had obvious rips and stains all over. The mini suite did have a mini frig which was nice to have. Avoid the Red, white and blue restaurant. It low quality food at greatly inflated prices (even for Vegas). A cold, plain, turkey sandwich was $16-18.00 and didn't even come with chips. There is no security at the hotel and we frequently saw suspicious people wandering around the parking ramp. This should be a 2.5-3 star not a 4 star resort!"

We were worried at first from reading all the negative comments but it was the only hotel that appealed to us. We read so many negative comments about the rooms, but we were very happy, ours faced the many pools (our opinion better than the strip view), it wasn't \"luxury\", but we are very picky about where we stay. The room was quite large, very firm comfortable beds, very clean, the bathrooms were very large with two sinks, marble, glass shower, tub, separate toilet area. The pool area was wonderful, several pools with music playing around the wave pool area, we didn't have a problem getting towels or lounge chairs maybe because of the time of year. There are many restaurants and clubs there. We went to both Rumjungle and Ivan Kane's, we loved both. Ivan Kane's was fun but we definately would recommend bottle service there. The people there were very friendly, helpful and of course we had great service. The mexican restaurant we would recommend, although very pricey, you can sit down on the patio and watch the people in the \"lazy river\", or you can sit inside for a more quiet atmosphere. Overall the hotel was very spacious and open, you will see once you go through the other hotels, the casino area was one of the nicest, the tram was very handy, it went to the Luxor then to Excalibur, it is free and you are there in a matter of a couple of minutes, then if you wish you can take the Deuce bus, but we only recommend this bus if you have patience, it stops quite often and then you have to wait for several people to get on. For shows we highly recommend La Reve, and Le Femme, both unbelievable! We will be back to Mandalay Bay, can't wait!!!"

Not once did housekeeping vaccum the carpet during my four day stay, but the bathroom floors were mopped daily. The breakfast and dinner buffet were wonderful!...pricey, but worth every penny. Check-in and check-out was quick and bellmen were very fast.. Concierge sold us show tickets the day after the date we requested and we didn't discover the problem until getting to the show site. We just attended the event the next day and never complained to concierge. A bus stop outside the hotel was very convenient. Two Starbucks inside the hotel was great! Even though the rooms are probably sound proof, we constantly heard airplanes at all times of the day and night.. This hotel is the closest to the airport! Mandalay Bay has huge convention space and is definitely your best bet if you have a convention at this hotel. If you must stay here, I would recommend the connecting, \"The Hotel\", which is an all suite hotel at Mandalay Bay. The rooms are more expensive, but more modern."

The room was nicer than I expected after reading the reviews. I agree that they should upgrade the linens, but they are adequate. The bed was on the firm side, but I probably wouldn't have noticed that if I hadn't read other reviews. I slept fine...did hear maids in the hallways in the mornings. The bathroom was great! All marble with a separate tub and shower, double sinks, separate room for toilet. The room seemed clean and room was always cleaned when we left. BUT...Friday morning when I woke up I noticed a Nutri Grain wrapper in my bed that I DIDN'T EAT!! YUCK!! Obviously, the sheets hadn' t been changed. Called downstairs to complain and they said they'd come change the linens. We didn't pursue it, but I think they should have offered us SOMETHING! Went to the pool on Friday afternoon around noon. A few pools were closed, but the Wave pool, lazy river, and one other pool were open. There were plenty of towels, but had trouble finding chairs. After walking around awhile, we found 2 chairs stacked on each other. Then had to search for a pool guy to move them for us. Found a spot on \"the beach\" (sand all around wave pool) and ordered some pina coladas! Thought the pool area was very nice. Ate at Burger Bar in Mandalay Place for lunch one day. Thought it was great! Loved the whole \"build your own burger\" deal. Ate at Raffles Cafe late night one night. Food was just okay here. Shared nachos and chicken fingers. There was a pretty large menu and the place was packed at 3am. Overall liked the hotel, but would probably stay Center Strip next time, as cab rides were between $10-$12 each time we left."

I told them I didn't want anything except an inspection to determine if there were bed bugs so they can remedy the problem. They said they would look into it, so I asked them to follow up with me to confirm they actually did follow up and to let me know what they found. They said that they would not call me back because even if there were bed begs, no one from the hotel would ever admit it to me or to anyone outside of the hotel staff. So I've let the hotel know, but since there is no way for anyone else to ever know if there are bed bugs at the Mandalay Bay, consider yourself warned."

You can get on and off at every hotel and even Downtown Vegas whenever you please. Here is what we found Pools: Not crowded, a little tricky finding chairs together, but so what. There are 4 pools. Find a chair and people watch. We had no problem with towels. The pool drinks were pricey, but duh, it is a luxury hotel. Rooms: It may have been because we were there during the week as opposed to a weekend, but we had a great check in/out experience and no problem with the room. Wonderful shampoo, soap, bath beads, etc. With regards to room maintenance, there is a card in the bathroom that states they are trying to conserve water and if you really did not need anything changed (sheets, towels, etc.) then they would only come in every 3rd day. We were there for three days and thought that was fine. We did not care if the sheets were changed and we just hung up the towels not a big deal. If you wanted them more they came or if you ran out of anything we just found them in the hall and got what we needed or contacted housekeeping. We are Las Vegas fans and this was definately the best hotel we have stayed in on the strip. And trust me, I am a hotel snob."

My friend and I (we are 25 and 26) arrived and the hotel on 10/11 and were amazed at how beautiful it was...the lobby, restaurants, and casino looked great. We went into our room, however, but that was a different story. Our room looked really, really outdated it just looked empty. The TV unit took up a huge part of the wall and it looks like it was just put there to take up space! The tv was not a plasma (I'm jealous of the previous reviewer's tv) and the reception was TERRIBLE. The channels were very staticy and the tv kept freezing. Also, the volume would constanly go in and out. The bathroom was huge and had two sinks, but there was a glass shower, which was so inconvenient for us! We couldn't get ready in the bathroom while one of us was in the shower. What a pain. The walls were SO thin...we could here our neighbors and their screaming child loud and clear. The maid service was extremely slow and they didn't even come our second day there. Our other friends stayed at the Mirage and there rooms were GREAT and they were a bit cheaper. They also had a minibar in there room, which we did not. The gym was $27 for one day. It was so ridiculous. I was aware that you had to pay for the gym before I got there, but $27??? Not worth it. We used the gym once. Overall, we were pretty disappointed with our hotel. Luckily we had a great time shopping and going to the clubs. I would definitely not stay at MB again. We blew so much money on taking taxis and the monorail because of the location of the hotel. I would recommend staying somewhere in the middle of the strip and at a hotel with nicer rooms! Please listen to the other reivews as well!"

However, the many other positive aspects outweigh the negatives. All service personnel were very friendly! prices were basically the same as they would be at any other 4/5 star hotel. The pools were superb. Although there were a fair amount of of people there, towels were plentiful and the area was immaculate! The casino was well layed out and not too big. They had bands in all the lounges after five and visitors were also amicable. Yes, it is at the far end of the strip. However, one is pretty well aware of this when booking their vacation. It's also loads of fun to walk down the strip. We had a great time!!"

    "content": "Stayed at the Mandalay Bay from Sept. 21st to 25 th. We had a great time, but don't come here looking for anything affordable. The hotel was great. Big and over the top as you would expect from a newer Vegas property, but you are going to pay. Our first meal was lunch at the Border Grill. 75 Bucks!!! Pretty good mexican food, but not great. That meal set the tone for the weekend. Positives. The pool is great. We were there after summer vacation so the crowds were not what you may have read from others. I can only imagine how crazy it would be in the middle of summer. Great pool, good drink service(but high roller Vegas prices), and lots of eye candy. Guys wear some wrap around shades to the wife doesn't slap you. Room was nice. Ask for a Strip view. It was awesome. The hotel is on the south end of the Strip so you see everything. Huge bathroom with a real tub and a seperate shower. Clubs were cool. House of Blues, you know what to expect there. A bar called Red Square. Vodka bar with an ice covered bar. This was really cool and impressive, but you will pay through the nose. $24 for two vodka and cranberries made with just a middle priced vodka. Negatives.... You are on the south end of the strip. Which is really not walking distance from anything. You can get to the Luxor from inside the property and then take a tram to Excaliber which puts you next to NYNY and MGM Grand. So be ready to get creative with transportation or you will be shelling out cash for cabs all day. The other negative was cost. I really found nothing on the property that was cheap to eat. Don't get me wrong the food was all good, but if you are looking for a couple of fast food priced meals to save a little money... Forget it. The only thing close was a place called the Burger Bar. Affordable but is still a bar which costs me money in beer. All in all a great time and would recommend it, just know what you are getting into cost wise."

Good thing we bought bubble bath for our honeymoon suite room since we never got more. Also good thing we brought shampoo since we never got more of theirs either. We stayed there to enjoy the pools, which were very hard to navigate through. Could not rent an intertube even with our room key cause the pool person could not find us in the computer and offered no help. Asked for new and more towels for our room per the sign in our bathroon, staff was rude about it. I sent a complaint email after our trip which was recieved and an automated response said I would get a reply - nothing after 4 months. Pricey hotel - NOT worth the money. Also, put bottled water in our room that we did not drink (instead of soap??) the last day we were there and charged us for it (even though it wasn't even in there any other day). Obviously the hotel does not need us back since they were rude while we were there and unresponsive to our unhappy visit. Very unhelpful, ungrateful, grumpy staff. Don't stay there - you will be an inconvenience to them."

What a waste. It was 95 degrees outside and no place to swim.

Second room was much better but I were moved to the 14th floor. They really made no attempt to help us get rooms close together, due to some medical problems my parents had. The rooms were not what I expected. I thought it was a beatuful hotel, until I got there, the rooms did not match the lobby and surrounding land and structures. I think the Aladdin had better service and better prices for the las vegas area. I have already made reservations for the Panet Hollywood/Aladdin I've been there before and love the place.

    "content": "My husband and I stayed at Mandalay Bay Sep. 3 & 4. We were celebrating our 3rd anniversay so we decided to upgrade to an executive suite. When I called the hotel to learn the descriptions of the honeymoon suite and the executive suite I was told that the executive suite was larger and had a separate bedroom and living/dining area. When we got to the room we found out that that is not the case. According to our bellman, the honeymoon suite and executive suite are pretty much the same size but just have a little different layout and location. So I certainly would not recommend spending the extra money on the executive suite to anyone. When we got to the room we discovered that our refrigerator did not work , we were missing light bulbs, the hair dryer was broken and the speaker phone on the phone by the bed didn't work. We called the front desk and let them know our problems. We left our room and went to the pool. It was nice but very crowded since it was a holiday weekend and we seemend to be around a lot of smokers which wasn't good for us. When we went back to the room we found that we had light bulbs in the lamps, a new hair dryer and a different refrigerator which was set up on a big ugly cart in our room. We called the front desk again to see if they could just replace the original fridge and remove the cart. The front desk said that they would and also said that they would not charge us for the upgraded room. We left our room to go to dinner and upon our return found that the staff had replaced the fridge on the cart with a different one on the cart (made no sense!). We didn't call and complain again since they were not cahrging us for the upgrade. The bathroom of the room was very nice with double sinks, a spa tub for two and a separate shower. Our only complaint about the bathroom is that they will only give you two towels because of Las Vegas water conservation. Our second day we decided to try the Moorea Beach Club. We called the night before and were told that they open at 9AM and that it was first come first serve. We got there at 9AM and waited in line for about a 1/2 hour for them to open. They charged us $10 for me and $50 for my husband (an extra $10 for men on Monday b/c of the holiday). We were led to very nice lounge chairs and were given wristbands and were told that they could only save our lounges for an hour if we wanted to leave for anything. We ended up having a wonderful time there. They play great music which makes it feel like a club. The bar servers were wonderful and brought us our drinks really fast every time we ordered. With our reservation we were given some coupons for two free drinks at both the Beach and Mix and were frustrated to find out the they would not accept them on Monday because it was a holiday. . . Oh well! As far as food goes,we ate breakfast at the House of Blues one morning and had a wonderful meal and service. We ate at one of the cafes by the pool and had very dry plain chicken sandwitches. We also tried the Wolfgang Puck Italian restaurant and hands down had the WORST meal we have ever had. It was literally almost inedible! We played a little on the slots and had a lot of fun and even won some $$. . . All in all, we had a great time and would stay there again:-)"

We had approximately 15 family members that stayed at MB and about 10 that stayed other places. We loved MB! The service was outstanding! Our honeymoon suite was huge and had a jacuzzi tub in it! It was neat and clean and we had no problems! Everyone else had regular rooms and also liked their rooms. The morning of the wedding my flowergirls, my mom, and myself had our hair done at the Robert Cromeans salon. I also had my make-up done there. We looked like models when we left! The new chapel is absolutely beautiful! Our pictures are the best! Our wedding coordinator, Marcela, was great, making sure that everything was perfect for our wedding. The minister did a wonderful job, making everything meaningful and perfect. It was a perfect day. We had a dinner reception after the wedding at the Bayside Buffet. The had a private room there and a VIP entrance. Everything was set us for us when we got there. We also had a wedding cake that was made at the hotel bakery and it was wonderful! We did a champagne toast and the champagne was expensive, but they did make sure that all the guests who were minors had sparkling cider so they could taost too! Everyone loved the buffet. The food was really good and the service was great. As part of our wedding package we also got breakfast in bed one day (which was awesome!) and dinner for my new husband and I at Shanghi Lilly. It was the best dinner I have ever had in my entire life! We also ate breakfast at the House of Blues one morning. I loved my food, but new husband wasn't too impressed with his omelet. We ate dinner one night at Red, White, and Blue. It was kind of pricey for sandwiches, but still really good food. My family and friends went to see Mamma Mia! We did not go, but they said it was well worth the ticket price. They said it was a lot of fun."

Carpet was newer and not stained, towels were clean, much better than the first room we were given. The pool area was crowded and there is no shade - period. Just rows and rows of lounge chairs. Hotel's website and other photos make the pool complex appear more expansive than it is. There IS a pool tucked away from the main complex that was much less crowded, it's worth seeking out. We paid $159 + tax for the night, booked directly with Mandalay. Have previously stayed at the Mirage, Rio and now Mandalay. The Mirage was the best of the three, though there seems to be a willingness in Las Vegas to offer an inferior room to a guest that accepts it as an \"oh well, it's Vegas.\" Yes, the LV hotels have tons of rooms and tons of guests, but a hotel should renovate as needed and not offer the customer a shoddy product."

Upon check in no rooms were ready so we went to the pool (9:30am) no chairs or loungers were available and we went and asked if there were anymore and were told that we were too late and needed to get here earlier, by the first of MANY rude employees at Mandalay. We were finally able to check into our room on the 28th floor (non smoking) and as we walked down the hall all we could smell was pot. We called downstairs demanding another room and they gave us one and that was all....my friend had a similar situation arise at her stay at the W hotel and they compd one night of her stay there. When the bellman brought our bags up to our new drug free room, we told him what happened and he said \"oh well, Vegas is a 24 hour hour town\" and i responded quickly with \"and drugs are still illegal\" The second day we asked for a 2nd beach towel at the still overcroweded pool and we were told no........the floats in the river cost $16 and i am pretty sure that i could have bought the same raft at target for $3. Every employee at Manadalay Bay with the exception of a nice waitress named Tina left little to be desired, for as much competition as they have out there, Mandayaly needs to clean up its act! I will be staying somewhere else next time for sure!!! What a HUGE dissapointment!"

    "content": "I have stayed at the Paris, Aladdin and Ballys before and my friends stayed at the flamingo. I can quite honestly say that this is the best hotel i have stayed at in Vegas, and only the Atlantis in the bahamas edges it in my all time favourite hotels (and i have stayed in quite a lot both on holidays and with work). First things first, when reading some of the negative reviews (which i did before going on my holiday) i was very worried. I did notice a pattern though. Each person who put a bad review on had a 'unique' experience that affected their time here. Their plane was delayed, their luggage didnt arrive, they were unwell, they had an accident etc etc. I discounted all of these reviews as these could happen to anyone and it would affect your holiday. My rating is objective - my previous job was looking at hotels to use for corporate events. I therefore have a critical eye for details. Here are the positives about the hotel: 1 It is clean, in the rooms/hallways/elevators/in the casino/around the grounds/in the pool area 2 The bedrooms are of a very good standard (the bathrooms are very large also with 2 sinks, bath, powerful shower and seperate toilet). If you put this room in New york, Rome, London or Paris people would say that the room is excellent..dont let people fool you into thinking they are bad rooms, they are not! 3 Service - i saw, and experienced largely good service...a few abrupt people, but that comes with the territory of any hotel. 4 Facilities - show me a better hotel in Vegas!!! Spa is amazing, pools are the best in vegas (i do accept that there is little shade around the main pool, but you can go to the south lagoon pool for shade...or if you dont want sun, then go to alaska!) 5 Entertainment - world class - from the bars (my favourite was MIX at the THE hotel) to the restaurants (i recommend the gospel brunch on a sunday, the buffet is good (but not as good as the wynn or the paris) and The Burger Bar was good also. Mamma mia is the best show in town...without question. 6 Location - although it is at one end of the strip, this actually means that you dont get a lot of non hotel guests crowding the place out. Ok so what are the downsides: Pool - you do have to 'reserve' your seats early-ish (before 9.00am i would say) to get your PREFFERED seating. If you leave it until 10.00am onwards you could be anywhere. After 11.00am, you only may have the south lagoon pool. Conventions - most popular hotel on the strip for them...this can make you wait on occassion for a lift if you time it that you want a lift when a convention finishes (happened to us once in 10 days and then we only waited 2 minutes). Thats it....here are some tips before you travel: 1 e-mail the hotel and ask them for a strip view or a pool view both are great! (if you stay between the 2nd and 16th floors you have seperate lifts which are far less busy so you could request one of those) 2 Take your inflatable doughnuts with you for the lazy river to avoid the $20 cost. Or there is a walmart just past New york, New york where you can buy them for half the price. Check out e-bay..you can even then sell them on, so no cost to you! 3 Book in for Mamma mia, but you dont need to pay the full price. The theatre isnt massive so just get any tickets, they are all good views (although we were second row which was excellent) Also there is a TKTS booth across from the monte carlo and you can pick up tickets there for as little as $50 most days 4 Dont bother taking sun tan lotion if you go from the uk...buy it there...saves space and it is cheaper!! You need a high factor due to the lack of shade! 5 Dont bother going to luxor/excalibur - you wont miss much, the same with the shark reef..trust me! Go to New york new york, espn shows english soccer games, and if you go to the reception and ask nicely they will give you a buy one get one free beer and food voucher for nine fine irishmen. Watch the duelling pianos they are excellent (also good at the paris, but more sophisticated in napoleons bar) 6 Go to MIX bar at THE hotel, the voodoo lounge (before 20.00pm to avoid the cover charge) at the Rio, ALL the bars at New york, New york, V bar at the venetian (you will need ID), Tangerine at treasure island (to view the sirens show on the outdoor balcony) 7 Book your stay when a convention is on....some cater for 5000 people...and because they are in the convention, the pool is sooo much quieter!!!! Look up the convention timetable on google 8 Enjoy it - dont let one experience drag your time down....make the most of it!!"

As far as the room/service, etc... it was average. Nothing spectacular, nice but what you would expect for the room rate. The really bad thing about it was how far away it was from 'Vegas'. The casino seemed boring to me and granted it was spring break but geez... you couldn't get into the pool because it was Family Vacation Hell!! Took forever to get drinks, when you weren't dodging a bunch of 6 year olds. If you want to go anywhere you have to take a cab, the shuttle only goes so far. And believe me getting a cab was not so easy. Then you are stuck in traffic in the cab while trying to get downtown. The shuttle only takes you to the inner outskirts of the strip so you still have about a 15 minute walk. To walk from Mandalay to Caesars was at LEAST a half-hour. Although there are all kinds of restaraunts & clubs in MB, they were all pretty dead and/or only people that are actually staying at the hotel because there really isn't a reason for anyone to go to MB when everything they could possibly want is at the strip. We went to all the hotspots and when we walked into The Palms it was like walking from a retirement home into ... well... life. There were actually people gambling, and laughing & dressed nice, drinking, having fun - same goes for Caeser's plus it's location was perfect (which is where I will stay if I ever go again) If you want to be in the middle of the action STAY AWAY from Mandalay Bay!! Yes, the pool was nice, but c'mon do you really go to Vegas for a pool? If so, then Mandalay is probably perfect for you. I wouldn't recommend MB to anyone except maybe a female with her husband & kids that wants to keep her hubby away from other distractions, like enjoying life... well okay, that may be a bit harsh, but if you are going to Las Vegas to experience Vegas, stay somewhere closer to Caesar's. Oh, and btw, if you are sharing the room, the bathroom is pretty nice/large but don't expect any privacy. One of us would be in the glass-doored shower while another one would be getting ready and the other person could be taking a bath or going to the bathroom all in the same little area, it was quite cozy!!"

At my husband's suggestion we stayed at Treasure Island- a theme hotel with a serious identity crisis (TI or Treasure Island- seriously, what are you?). The visit was so awful that we changed our flight and left a day early. He still swears Treasure Island was a great hotel about 10 years ago, maybe so- but by last year it was club MTV meets confederate flag speedos. Enough said. I was not looking forward to going. This time around we stayed at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. From the moment we walked into the very spacious, immaculate lobby- I knew this trip was going to be much different. The suite was great. A living room with a wet bar, a large bedroom, a very large bathroom with a big bathtub and a granite stall shower and a powder room. There was enough room for us to spread out and work and the best part about it - not having to feel like we were in a bedroom while working. I did something I have never done in a hotel ever- which is take a long hot bath. Wonderful. after a trade show when your feet and back are screaming. The hotel bath salts actually smelled good to boot. My highest compliment to this hotel is that it never felt crowded, the layout is great and if you're agoraphobic or claustrophobic -- this is the place to be in Las Vegas. From the front desk to the bartender at Mix to the baristas at Starbucks- the staff at this hotel is outstanding. I have done my fair share of travel and I was truly amazed at how friendly and personable the staff was - the staff is what really makes this hotel shine. My only complaint about the hotel is that the room is a little too dark and while that may be sexy --it's a little hard to work or read in. That could easily be remedied by putting a light fixture in the center of the ceiling in the living room part of the suite. I'm sure lots of people stay at The Hotel for business since there is a convention center at Mandalay Bay.I think that a little more light in the workspace would be greatly appreciated. The 'The\" thing is a little tedious ie: The Private Bar, The Digits, The Store, The this, The That- The 'TP'? I really don't love a label on my toilet paper. But those things are easy to forgive because my stay at 'The Hotel' completely changed my attitude about Las Vegas. 180*."

I booked this hotel six weeks in advance for myself and my son and grandchildren. It was to be a treat for the children because of the beachlike pool. I requested adjoining rooms so that the children could have supervision. When I arrived at check-in it was a nightmare, the rude clerk told me there were no rooms side by side, we were given rooms two wings away from each other. Strangely enough the clerk the next day was able to find us adjoining rooms and told me that they had been available the day before. No one helped us pack and move!!! The beds had torn bedspreads, the dressers were missing their knobs and the blinds had a broken pull rod!! Our view was of the air conditioners and at 7AM the cleaning crew was washing the windows. As if this wasn't bad enough chairs and towels run out at the beaches at about 11AM. There is no I repeat shade or misters provided unlike at other Las Vegas Pools. There are cabanas for rent at 500.00 per day. Inner tubes for the lazy river cost 16.00 to 20.00. If you have a car drive to a supermarket and buy them. The much touted wave pool is shallow and dangerous unlike the regular beach it is concrete and easy to scrape your knees surfing in. Here is the supreme kicker the area from the pools to the elevators are slick marble, there are no mats or rubber. I slipped on water dripped from one of the guests and fell. I was given no compensation or comped anything. I was not driven to a hospital. I saw a doctor when I returned, my knees are black and blue and swollen. I have missed work. When I called security I was asked to sign a release not to sue which of course I refused. I missed a show and lay in bed with ice on my knees for hours. Nothing has been done for me. Someone vomited outside our room and the cleaners had to come at 2AM to clean it. The whole hotel consists of young guests sharing rooms who spend hours in the halls on their cell phones (in the AM). An awful hotel."

When we asked if it was a strip view, they said we could have one, but not until check in time. Since we were able to check in at 9 am we decided to skip the strip view. (Another party we were travelling with requested 2 queen beds, and their room was facing the strip.) We were very very pleased to check in at 9 am. The room was very nice. There was a wet spot on the carpet, but in my mind it was clean! The only other thing \"wrong\" with the room was the little bit of frayed carpet at the door. Other than that, it was a spacious room, with a spacious bathroom. Very clean, and was cleaned everyday without any problems. After unpacking, went immediately to the Burger Bar, awesome burgers, awesome service. We then got some provisions at a liquor store across the street and went to the pool. I was somewhat skeptical about being at the pool on a Saturday. By this time it was 12-1pm. As predicted, no sign of chairs, and very packed. We did manage to get a \"spot\" and eventually some chairs to call a home base. Our party of 11-15 people were all at the pool, and I think all had a good time despite the crowd. There was enough shade as well. I went back to the pool Sunday, and it was less crowded, still a chair shortage, but I sat on the edge of the pool and noticed one chair open, and grabbed it, within an hour there were chairs around me becoming available. On Monday it was even less crowded, and had no problem finding 2 chairs. We stayed near the actual pool and not the wave pool or lazy river. I also never saw a shortage of towels any day I was there. We also ate at the lunch buffet on Monday. I also think it was excellent and well worth the 16 bucks. I would definately stay here again. Room was clean and spacious. Staff was friendly."

Quieter pools around for a more peaceful & relaxing day in the sun! Although at the end of the strip the Monorail takes you to the Excalibur & then you can link up with the Stip monorail at the MGM.

The hotel was very plush, with a huge wave pool and lazy river on the beach, which gave us hours of fun! You would never know you were in the middle of the desert put it that way. The casino was great too, especially sitting on the slot machines and getting drinks brought to you for free. The place was buzzing and wasn't a place you could get any sleep, the noise outside was really bad even though we were so high up we could hear everything. I don't think I slept for the whole three nights we were there. We had a lovely meal at Shanghi Lilly's - it was fantastic, the service, the food, the wine it was just perfect - this is one not to be missed. Didn't think much to the other places they rushed you and never really cared about the service they gave you. We even won \u00a3200 on the slots the second night which made the holiday.

Only one strange thing, the maids stuffed the bedspreads in the closets the first day they cleaned...right on top of the stuff on the floor of the closet, a little weird. Great views of the strip. Wasn't hard getting to the other casino's on the strip...just take a little walk, then get on the tram. Raffles was great for breakfast, only one waitress was a little rude, otherwise all the staff in the hotel was nice...from the front desk to the cabana rental staff.

Don't be alarmed when you find out that there is a charge for EVERYthing you can imagine ($20 for an inner tube rental!). The drinks and food were very overpriced.

We were able to check-in early which was greatly appreciated, but that's only one of the few good things I have to say about the hotel. The Beach at Mandalay Bay consists of 3-5 small pool areas which surround the wave pool. Each day we used the beach area the hotel was out of towels by 10:30 a.m. and usually didn't have clean ones until 1:30-2:00 p.m. Once inside the beach area it was a nightmare getting to your destination. I felt like a mouse navigating a maze. You had to step over and around people and objects to get to your destination spot. There was minimal room for walking. As far as the rooms, the beds were made, but the sheets were dirty and there was sand on the bedspread. Daily housekeeping consisted of clean towels and emptied trash cans. Not at all what I expected."

We booked in April for an August 7th departure and waited with great anticipation for our trip. We both enjoyed Mandalay Bay immensely but there were a couple things we were surprised with when it came to quality but first, the things we loved. 1.Pool was spectacular. You could easily spend the entire day there. It is also a great pool if you have kids, especially if they are 4 ft + 2.Clubs are great and the list of performers is exceptional. Check who is playing before you set your dates. We missed out on seeing Boz Skaggs by a day and Nickel Back by a week. 3.Burger Bar, sad but true, the Kobe burger was the best meal we had. 4.Free drink ladies in casino were quite attentive and prompt. 5.Cheap ride from the Airport. $10.50 to the hotel $9.60 to Airport The not so great 1.I have to say, I have slept on Backpack foamies that were more comfortable than the bed we got. 4 horrible nights sleep, good thing we didn\u2019t do much sleeping. 2.Staff was grumpy and short with guests. From lobby to the pool, there was a negative vibe coming from the staff. For 4 star hotel, the staff should have been be more pleasant, even if they have to fake it. 3.A wee bit far out. To get from Mandalay to MGM grand is great and easy but beyond can be a bit of a chore. 4.Table minimums were too rich for me. Most were $15 and during the day the lowest you could find was $10. Unless you have set aside some serious coin for gambling Mandalay is too rich for most."

We travelled with our two teenagers who are 14 and 16 and we were pleasantly surprised by the great restuarant choices, the shops in Mandalay Place and the clean and non-smoky casino. Our children enjoyed the game room at the Luxor which adjoins the Mandalay Bat through a shopping walkway. My husband and I checked out the spa at the sister property THEHotel and we loved it. Very nice gym and hip, tranquil, water themed spa. Really lovely with a great staff. Also, we saw the great show MAMA MIA!-What a trip!-Both of our kids enjoyed it and what a great Performing Arts Center. Upscale and so nice to have a theatre experience. Have no doubts about the quality of this resort. We would return in a minute!"

At first we were going to ask for a strip view but were really pleased with the view we got. We managed to get a sun bed every day no probs, I did send my partner down in the morning to put a towel on the bed anyway! Found it abit quieter siting round the lazy river. We eat at the buffet inside the hotel for lunch and dinner during our stay and would really recommend it. Tried Excalibar one night as it is slightly cheaper but wouldnt recommend it. The hotel is huge and we didnt get to see everything. Ladies make sure you wear flat shoes! Tried to every hotel, Balengio is great there is a bar where you can sit over looking in jumping fountains and paris. At night its beautiful. Try and bring something smart to wear if you want to go up Paris at night. We tried and couldnt get in as we were under dressed. Cant remember the name but next to MGM there is a Mexican restaurant next to the M&M shop, try it its great! All in all it was a great holiday, not what I expected but amazing. Will def go back!!"

My first room: The carpet was so badly stained that I was uncomfortable taking my shoes off. The shower head was covered in pink mold. Housekeeping arrived and cleaned the shower head. While housekeeping was in the room she apologized to me for how dirty the carpet was and said to me that she had called the front desk alerting them to the carpet problem. At that point I asked to have my room changed. I was told there would not be a bellman for at least one hour so I packed myself and went to the front desk. I brought with me a white washcloth that I had dampened and rubbed along part of the carpet. It was completely black. The front desk agreed that the room was unacceptable and they upgraded me to a penthouse suite. Great Suite, on the top floor looking right down the strip with an express elevator. Suite had a bar area, two large bathrooms, large living room, large bedroom with a bed that was significantly more comfortable than what was in the other rooms. While the suite was nice, had I payed the going rate or been a comped high roller, I would have been upset. The large windows had those slide vents at the bottom. The rubber was worn off and they whistled. I had to take the bathroon scale and place it on one of them to keep it from whistling. There were no glasses in the bar area in fact in two bathrooms in this huge suite, there were only two glasses to be found. Many of the light bulbs were burnt out. The sleep timer on the bedroom TV did not work. The one in the living room worked so I could have slept on the couch and used that sleep timer. At least this room was clean. Other members of my group had problems in their rooms: No towels. No wash cloths. Also filthy carpets. Non working hair dryer. One person even got locked in her room and could not get out and had to call maintenance to break the electronic lock. I had stayed in this hotel twice before and loved it although it was approximately 6 years ago. It was a shame to see how this hotel has deteriorated."

Although it does have a nice wet bar (not stocked), and a jacuzzi tub. The main reason my wife and I stayed at the Mandalay Bay was for the pool scene, which is top notch. There are actually several pools, a couple of regular pools, the wave pool, and the lazy river pool. Before going to the MB, I read the previous reviews, and would suggest following the advice of bringing your own floating toy. The MB doesn't care if you bring your own floater, they'll even fill it with air for free at the \"surf shack\" next to the lazy river. Bringing your own saves you $20 per floater. We also brought a small cooler filled with water, sodas, food, and no one seemed to care. Pool side drinks are between $10 - $15 dollars. The pool grill was a little pricey, but not too bad, and the food was pretty tasty and hearty. Get to the pool early, because the lounges do get taken quick, even on the weekdays. The only complaint about the pool is that they close very early. 7:00PM in the summer, and there are no jacuzzi's open after that. At 7:00PM a cadre of young lifeguards start yelling at people to get out of the pool in a manner that would make a drill sergeant proud. Did not expect this from such a nice resort. There are much better ways of clearing out a pool area, especially when guests are paying several hundred dollars a night to stay there. My only real complaint about the MB is the lack of service. On a Tuesday evening I tried to get room service twice. The first time I called I was on hold for 7 minutes, I hung up. Called back 20 minutes later and was on hold for 8 minutes, until I hung up and called for delivery pizza which was there in 30 minutes. I couldn't believe that on a weeknight, during the low season, that I could not get room service. I bet the weekends during convention season must be impossible. Overall I had a good stay with a couple of minor inconviences, but would stay again. Especially nice for families who like the pool scene and have children who can swim. I would stay again."

The rooms at Mandalay need an overhaul. They don't compare to other newer properties. Our carpet was so dirty and our room smelled horrible! The view was great if you could get over the stink! I was told that the spa had been renovated and I was looking forward to this, but the only thing I noticed was a couple of new curtains over the doors. The fitness facility does not compare to the other nicer properties. Stay at one of the newer hotels on the strip and go party at Mandalay one night."

I had not been to Vegas in a few years and I went with on a corporate retreat with all expenses paid. There are a lot of cool things about M-Bay. The pool/beach scene was definitely one of the best I have been to in Vegas - a definite plus. The sports book would be a good place to spend a fall Saturday or Sunday afternoon. The rooms and the overall environment however just don't measure up to upscale properties like the Venetian, Bellagio or the Wynn. Both are nice, but it depends on how much you are paying in my opinion and what your expectations are of the room and the casino. The other consideration is location - the hotel is on the southern end of the strip. It is somewhat isolated but there is a tram that connects the hotel to its neighbors Luxor and Excalibur. From there you have relatively easy access to NY-NY and MGM although you have to walk through the entire MGM to get to the monorail to access the rest of the strip. Cabs are always an alternative but you can get stuck in long lines and its going to add up if you take them from place to place. If the price was right and the weather was warm enough for pool action, I would definitely consider this hotel again. But if this hotel is priced even close to other upscale hotels, then I would go with one of the others, especially if the pool was not part of my trip."

PROS - big rooms and bathroom, separate bath and shower stall - best and biggest pool areas in LV (we researched ahead and visited many while there); despite the 105 degree temperatures in the day (low 90s at night) the wave pool and lazy river remained cool and refreshing - don't know how they did that, while the other two pools got very warm - moderately good amount of palm trees for shade (though there are ever enough - great assemblage of restaurants - no need to go outdoors for those or shopping or visiting the next door Luxor Hotel since a small shopping mall attaches the two - from inside Mandalay you can also take a tram to the Luxor and the Excaliber, though both necessitate walking outside from their trams station drop offs. - the ability to call up and get the latest (lower) room rates from when you initially booked your trip. We booked on line 5 weeks ahead and saved an additional $200 after two calls within two weeks of departure as rates fell. Then they went up again so we didn't call again! - free use of very luxurious bathrobes, but you have to call up and ask for them - really neat restaurants like the Rum Jungle that has a trapese act at night (but a still cover charge of $20pp after 11pm), this is one of the in places for locals and guests judging by the lines to get in at night or a frozen bar called Red Square where you are given a coat and have vodka from the freezer - rooms well sound insulated, interior public areas exquisite CONS - Since Mandalay sees themselves as an upper end resort, amenites that some of the other resorts have are missing (that some even nicer ones still have) - no food court, therefore the most reasonably priced restaurant (the Red, White and Blue) still cost you $10+ for breakfast or lunch pp and more for dinner. You can, without going outside, use the food court at the Luxor, or take the ten minute walk to your car and drive to McDs or Subway across the street - no guest laundry (did a lot of Woolite washing) and no clothesline over tub or in shower - no mirror in bedroom; there was a large mirror over the two bathroom sinks and a large full length mirror next to the shower, the latter should have been in the bedroom. - it took a week for them to come to repair the bathroom door that would not close all the way - only two chairs and no coffee or end table other than the desk (we moved to chairs to our nice view of the pool and mountains but needed a small table there) - a large number of rentable cabanas left us feeling a little like second class citizens (this is a pro if you don't mind spending $250-$1000 a day to rent them - but at least they had flat screen TVs!?!) - a very long walk to your car in the parking garage - 5-7 minutes through the casino and most of the restaurant mall. - no chairs in the main lobby (I know, they want you in the casino) - to visit a bathroom we had to go across a very large opulent lobby and take an escalator down to the floor below. - they charge guests to see Shark Reef - some maids don't know English and don't understand our notes (some do, because after two days of only 2 glasses and two bath towels for the 4 of us I dropped off a note with the front desk. I think we got a diferent maid after that.) -insufficient enforcement of the \"unattended chairs in excess of one hour will be considered vacated\" rule - though admittedly hard, it is very frustrating to get out there at 9am only to find all the shaded chairs taken by people who have put their book down and then left and probably gone to breakfast. I am guessing between 20 and 30 chairs were reserved this way every day. - pool closes at 7pm in the summer (I know, they want you in the casino) Disney World pools are open until midnight in the summer and it is not 95 degrees at night in Orlando - No ice or coolers allowed into the pool area (though not evenly enforced)"

Yes, there were some mix-ups with rooms (our son's room had not been cleaned when he checked in and he was given another room immediately), but, when one or two situations with no more available rooms for 2 queens happened, one family of our group ended up on the 60th floor in the penthouse! We also had made reservations for about 8 rooms and all was taken care of and everyone had a room in the computer when we got there. The people at the check-in were very nice. Our room was clean and not run down. We had plenty of towels and glasses and all amenities. Our daughter was married on Tuesday night at the chapel and everything there was really nice and well organized. Restaurants were interesting. We only ate at about 4 of them in our 4 days there. Many of them are very expensive. The casino had good bands in the Coral Reef area. We really enjoyed that! The pool was everything I had heard about it. Wonderful fun. The Surf Cafe had great food (cheeseburgers were awesome!) and good drinks, although the drinks were very expensive! ($10 for a Marguerita). All in all, a good trip. I think people need to remember how large this hotel complex is and how many people it takes to run it!"

    "content": "This hotel is not even close to 4-diamond. The rooms are big, but our room had no bath soap, few towels, and a shower curtain that was falling off to the point that I had to fight it during my entire shower. Our sink was clogged (and smelly) and despite calling them the morning after our arrival AND then waiting on line to tell them again that afternoon, we returned to the hotel at 10:30 that night to find that not only had the room not been cleaned but our linens were strewn across the floor and the bathroom, and the closets with our bags were opened with the lights on. We were concerned someone had entered our room, but because we reported nothing was missing, they could not have been less interested. They did upgrade us (we just wanted to move rooms b/c we were concerned that someone had gone through our stuff, did not care re: upgrade), but honestly we only had two nights in Las Vegas and between finding this, packing and moving to another room our second night was all but ruined. Plus, the manager treated us like we were lying, and said that unless we were willing to stay in the room and wait for security (all night and possibly the next day), he wasn't going to look into it. He also insisted the sink had been fixed, which was not true. INterestingly, the housekeeper that finally came to clean our room that night told us that this was a frequent problem since the hotel had \"outsourced\" these services to another company that was cheaper. I feel bad for the night housekeeping staff. And, FYI: they upgraded us to a 2BR parlor suite (we just wanted to move rooms since we didn't feel entirely comfortable, but did not request an upgrade) and it was in poor condition -- not worth whatever they are charging for it (no doubt that's why it was unoccupied!). The fixtures looked old, the carpets were stained and some of the lights didn't work. They were nice enough to offer us a delayed checkout (6PM), but this favor was sort of negated when housekeeping called us at around 5:55 and bluntly asked us \"when we would be leaving.\" They also gave us a credit towards room charges, which we barely used, but I had to call and remind them of this before we checked out (they would have charged us). Overall, we were most upset by the fact that they demonstrated no concern about any of this...i really think they are not staffed or trained to handle so many people at a hotel this size, and the service and amenities show it. The pool is always crowded and they do have a towel issue. Also, there are really no shaded areas, so I don't think the pool is such an attraction. TV's had few channels. Common areas are pretty and I don't think the elevators were an issue. The shark reef was cool. The bar itself at Mix was overrated and the drinks expensive, but the view is great and the restaurant looked cool. If you're there on a Monday night, go to the Foundation room. For a great brunch, try the Verandah at the Four Seasons (in the same building). Not that expensive (it's all relative) and very high quality. Would not stay here again. There are lots of other options in Vegas! All said, without the pool, may as well stay in a more central location on the strip."

We had rented a car and after waiting 20 minutes at the valet parking, gave up and left the car to go check in-what a nightmare-totally disorganized-long lines-rude staff. I felt like I was speaking a forein language when I clearly asked for a king bed close to elevator (which I'd reserved). Finding the elevator to the rooms was difficult. When we got to the room, the carpet was soaked making the already slippery bathroom floor very dangerous. We went to the pool to give it time to dry. The pools were packed with rude 20 somethings, smoking and jamming the lazy river. The cocktail waitresses were only interested in the 20 years olds. Went back to room where carpet was still soaked and then asked to change rooms. Were given the same quality room and no apology. The bellman and the maids were nice and helpful. Don't stay here unless you're under 30. Expensive and not worth it."

We would recommend this hotel to anyone. Our room was on the 8th floor and we had outstanding maid service. You definitely have to remember to lock your door or put out the \"do not disturb\" sign if you didn't want a 9am wake up call. I did appreciate that no matter how late we left, the room was always cleaned before we got back. The bathrooms are deluxe with plenty of soaps and bath products. We smelled so good for our visit. The phone by the toilet wasn't working properly and they replaced the handset for us. The wave pool was cool. The sand was a nice touch, but in 100+ degree temps it was scalding hot. We didn't even try any of the other pool areas and never had a towel problem. Didn't make it to the Shark Reef either, but they have a television channel devoted to a live cam so you don't really have to go. All of the public areas are gorgeous. The place is massive and you'll get to see all of it when you wander around lost. The casino isnt as crowded as compared to some in the middle of the Strip. I considered that a plus. The casino bars were fun, especially with the live entertainment and there's also a House of Blues. Our favorite for food and drink was rumjungle. My husbands only complaints were taking so many taxis and the busy elevator area in the lobby. The only improvement I can think of would be to come in a cooler month."

While the pool area was beautiful, the bathrooms were clean and spacious, and the beds were quite comfy. I was very disappointed with the service throughout Mandalay Bay. We ate dinner at China Grill and Guiliano's. The food was mediocre, and the waitstaff was inefficient. We had to ask repeatedly for additional water, and the waitstaff never returned to take our drink order at China Grill. While swimming in Moorea (an extra $10 fee for women), the cabana/pool boys neglected to accomodate our lounge needs (even though they gave attention to the male and hetero-couple guests' requests). The parlor suite was approximately $500 a night and the common furniture was extremely uncomfortable. Furthermore, the front desk was extremely inefficient. I waited 30-minutes to check-in and express check-out was unavilable. When calling the front desk to seek additional information or serveware, we were often placed on hold for long periods of time - sometimes as long as 15 minutes. When finally speaking to hotel staff, I had to repeatedly give my room number (they should know the room I am calling from), and requests took 30min-1 hour to fulfill (even for additional glasses). After waiting 10 minutes to talk to a front desk agent regarding resturant information (including prices), speaking to them for about 5 minutes, I was once again placed on hold for 10 minutes. I hung-up; I could not stay on-hold any longer. The agent did not return the call to my room, and I was forced to call them back. You would think spending over $1000 for two nights would lend itself to better service. I have received much more personal, accomodating, and efficient service at Marriots with rooms less than $200 per night!"

For the size of the hotel this should never happen, I spoke with an attendant and he said that everyone complains about this. Well in my opinion if everyone is complaining do something about it! When checking out I asked for a survey to complete as I wanted to put pen to paper, I was told to do it over the internet. The public transport, (buses) stop at every bus-stop, almost every casino and it took us almost 2 hours to get to Freemont Street, they certainly can try your patience, although they are very cheap. The mono rail from Mandalay Bay - Excalibur is free and is an excellent way to get between these two hotels. The lifts were very busy and you could wait a little while, although this didn't interfere with our holiday too much. The floats for rent were too expensive for what they were. Although we had an excellent time I would try a different hotel e.g. Ceasers Palace if we ever return."

We checked at noon, at 1:00, and at 2:00, and there were still no clean towels. In the 25 years we've been coming to Vegas, and the 10 or 12 hotels we visited in that time, we never found towels to be an issue at a pool. We theorized that MB was sending pool guests away as a form of \"crowd control,\" as the pool area was already uncomfortably crowded- too many people and lounge chairs in too small an area to accomodate everyone. Their famous \"wave pool\" was already loaded with too many chairs, and their unusually small outdoor cafe was impossible to get a seat at. This towel issue, however, was totally inexcusable, and that's exactly what we told the front desk person. We checked out that day and moved to The Bellagio, which, by the way, was a totally first-class experience."

    "content": "We stayed at the Mandalay Bay from July 2-4th. Overall, we had a good vacation here, but I don't think this is quite the \"four diamond\" hotel that it claims to be. A lot of it may have been due to the large crowds for July 4th weekend, however. My first impression was favorable. Upon entereing the lobby, the Mandalay Bay certainly has the look and feel of a higher end resort, with its nicely decorated lobby and well manicured grounds. The pool area was very nice... one of the better ones we've seen... has a nice, lush tropical feel to it. Unfortunately, they seem to run out of towels quite often, especially in the afternoons when it's most crowded. I thought the rooms themselves were pretty decent. I bit bigger than some others in Vegas. Ours was on the 14th floor, facing the pool area. We checked in at around 11 AM, and the room was ready by 1 PM. (They promise rooms by 3 PM) However, my brother in law wasn't so lucky For some reason, their room was not available until 5 PM. They called registration and housekeeing repeatedly after 3 PM. Initially at 4:30 PM, they were told it was ready, but when they entered the room, it was still a mess, with garbage strewn all over the floor. They called management, who promptly apologized and cleaned up the mess fairly quickly. I don't know if this is an anomaly or not... maybe the staff was just overwhelmed with the huge crowds this past weekend. Also, housekeeping does not change your linens or towels unless you ask them, too. We called them, and they seemed more than happy to do accomodate. Most of the restaurants appeared too expensive, but we did try out the buffet. I thought it was good, but not great. Worth going to, especially if you're tired, in a hurry, lazy, etc.. and don't want to leave the hotel. Not quite on par with, say Le Village at the Paris, but not bad, either. My biggest complaint, though was the crowds, and the hotel's seeming inability to adequatly deal with the sheer volume of people they had... from the long lines at check in, to the extremely long lines just to get into an elevator(!), to running out of towels by the pool. Overall, this is a beautiful hotel, with a wonderful, tropical themed pool area, including the wave pool. We probably wouldn't mind coming back here again someday, but after we try some of the other hotels, and next time, we'll come during a non-hoiday weekend."

The attendant actually told me, and I quote, \u201cI do not have to let you have these.\u201d After the patrons next to us stood up for us, the attendant left us alone. The other problem I have with the resort is the prices. A small bottle of water is $4.50. A domestic bottle of beer is $6.50. The least expensive meal for breakfast, a short stack of pancakes, is $11.50. An order of toast is $3.00. How can two pieces of toast cost $3.00? A hotdog is $7.00. If you stay here, be prepared to spend a lot of money. Several other guests we talked to said they had similar experiences. $150.00 per night is too much to spend for this kind of service."

One of you should run in to check in while the other waits in the valet line. 2. Request a room overlooking the pool. The other side looks at the airport and is a little noisy. 3. Bring or get a cooler and fill it with beverages and snacks. Plastic bottles needed for the pool. 4. About the pool: In order to get a seat you must get there early. I mean like 7am. There was a line a 6:45am. If you have the means, rent a cabana. It's worth it. 5. We ate at Red, White and Blue (it was the 4th afterall) and we do not recommend it. The restaurant is dirty and the food is average. I found \"something\" in my food. The waitress took it away and removed it from the bill. I didn't really want to eat anything after that. 6. Border Grill - dirty and bad food. We live in a town with tons of Mexican restaurants. This one is not worth your time. There is a better one off the strip worth checking out. It's on citysearch. They do make a decent mojito though. 7. Also about the pool: bring your own floaties or innertube if you are arriving by car. If not, stop at Walgreens where you can buy your cooler, water, and floaties before arriving at the hotel."

Our room was very spacious with a large bathroom area. The huge bathtub was heavenly for a relaxing soak after a long day. What a beautiful resort and casino. Best pool area. Only negative is that there is no seating area in the hotel check-in area. We would stay at this resort again when we go to Las Vegas."

    "content": "POOL: Visited the MB will hubby and 3 kids. We go every year to vegas. Stayed at Luxor and Excalibur before. No comparison with the pool. Our kids love the water and that was our main reason to stay at the MB. The pools are very nice. Yes, it was very crowded we went on the weekend and it was the 4th of July holiday. Stayed 3 nights. Yes, they run out of towels very quickly, so make sure you take your own. About the chairs, if you don't get there by 8:15 a.m. you won't find any chairs. The problem about the chairs is the PEOPLE. What we all do is reserve (put a towel or personal belonging) on a chair one for each family member. But, in reality we are not going to use them. The kids do not lay out or read/relax, people watch, on the chairs . They stay in the pool and so do most adults. So, if we would all be considerate and don't hog up all the chairs that we are not going to even use, then there would be no chair problem. If you ask one of the attendants walking around in blue shirts to find you a chair, they will. You just have to give them a tip. We gave (Zack-attendant) 2 of our chairs and he found 2 more and this man tipped him $40 for 4 chairs. The majority tipped $5 per chair. I was people watching. Ok I was being nosy. I also, seen a couple of people arguing with each other because they just couldn't find chairs. Just ask the attendants and tip them and you won't be all frustrated over the chairs. Also, the attendants (tyring to work up a tip) would come and ask if the chair were unoccupied for more than an hour and if you said yes, they would take them. There is was a couple of incidents regarding the chairs. Next to us this this lady reserved 4 chairs with folded umbrellas, then some young people came and moved the umbrellas to the floor and then they lady came and told them something, there were words exchanged and finally they left. Also, this young kids took these 2 older couples chairs in front of us and they man got so mad that this girl wouldn't get off the chair, so he pushed her and she fell off. I believe he was arrested because all this security came and took him. If this happens, just call a security person, don't get into it with someone and regret it later. Remember, there are a lot of people drinking. There was people of all ages including a lot of families. Make friends with the people next to you and watch each others chairs. If you wait until the pool closes (early) 7:00 p.m. The elevators do get very crowded and everyone wants to get in at the same time (issues). But remember you are on vacation, no need to hurry or push. The inner tubes sell for $16 each or you can rent them for $20. I bought 3, but a lot of people take their own and they inflate them for you for free. You do need a hotel key to get into the pool area. Each adult needs one and kids over 14 need their own. We have 3 kids, so they gave me 3 keys, so I or my husband would take the 2 little ones. In the a.m. they run the room key into the machine, it is just to check to make sure your card is still valid. When you check into reception, they do ask everyone's name of your party. Restaurants: My husband and son ate at the Burger Bar and they loved it. We all ate at the Border Grill, this was not our first time and to tell you the truth it is very expensive for what they give you. My son ordered the enchiladas ($28) and beans and rice were extra, plus they sat us outside and it was very hot with a hot fan blowing hot air. The kids got restless, so I asked to be changed to a table inside. I know mexican food and believe me this place is overpriced and is ok but, not great. Drinks are very good. When we go on vacation we like to spend money, but save your money on this one and eat at their little place they have before you enter Border Grill. It's a small grill/bar and they sell tacos and other foods for a reasonable price. Do have pastries or choclate at this place called something Swan their pastries are heaven. MB does not have any fast food restaurants. They do have 2 Starbucks. Next door at the Luxor, which we've stayed before. They have Quizno's/Little Cesar's Pizza and an arcade for teens. Or you can go next door to the Excalibur. They have McDonalds, a Chinese restaurant, Krispy Kreme, Cold Stone Ice cream. If you are too lazy to walk use the tram from the MB to the Luxor and they have an express directly to the Excalibur and back. The Excalibur has a nice arcade for kids of all ages. The MB has an aquarium that is kind of small, but nice. Rooms: The room was very clean and spacious. The bathroom very big and nice. Please tip the maid. I would leave $4-5 a day. They would leave extra towels and a lot of extra toiletries. These are very nice sizes and you don't have to take soaps/shampoo/conditioners/lotion/sea salt crystals/sewing kit/shoe shine sponge/cap. There is a room safe. Use the valet parking and just tip the guys a few bucks and save yourself the hassle of the parking. Overall: We loved the MB and do plan on staying here next time. Yes, it is far from other hotels, but you are going to have to do some walking sooner or later people! We only went to Luxor/Excalibur/New York, New York and MGM and the M&M Store. We also visited Cesar's palace because I wanted to do some shopping (Coach/D&G Stores). Feel free to email me if you have any questions. Remember that things will go wrong, and that there will always be rude people, but try to make the best out of your vacation!"

Fortunately I only stayed there for 2 nights. They definitely must replace their mattresses. Those things do not last forever, especially if they get cheap mattresses. The elevator was awfully crowded. I have never seen such a long line just to get into the elevator. That alone makes me not want to stay there anymore."

    "content": "I visited the Mandalay Bay Hotel from June 12 to June 16, 2006, to attend the eBay Live 2006 Convention. eBay Live was superb! The Mandalay Bay Hotel was not. I will begin this review with my qualifications to provide a realistic review of a high quality Hotel. I was Vice President of Inter-Continental Hotels, until my retirement in 1998. I was responsible for the design and construction of the Hotels in my region. Prior to that assignment, I managed the design and construction of Hotels for Inter-Continental and Sheraton. Summary 6 Star prices 3 Star facilities 2 Star services - some good, many poor Valet, Bells & Reception Valet and Bells provided fast, efficient, polite and personable services. They seemed well organized and trained. Front Desk Reception service was brusque, disorganized, tedious and erratic. No direction was provided being provided by Hotel Staff to assist guests and expedite the check-in process. You had to pick your line and then wait, wait and more waiting. After waiting in a line and arriving at the check in position, the clerk closed the position and directed me to another line. The Front Desk clerks carefully avoided eye contact with the guests. Finally, I arrived at the Front Desk after waiting in the second line. The clerk, this time, was willing to accept my reservation and check me into the Hotel. She was not quite rude, but her manner was not very welcoming either. Even though I was, supposedly, a VIP guest, ( they upgraded me to to a Suite for no additional charge), they had increased my first night room rate by $100 over the agreed charge (the rate was increased to $304 for one night). The Front Office Manager removed the $100 excess charge when I called down to complain and apologized for the error Elevators & Corridors Elevator decor was worn. I noted cracked marble flooring in at least one elevator. Corridors were worn and a bit shabby. The carpets were stained and unattractive. There is a fire exit at the end of each of the excessively long corridors on the guest floors. I was able to find emergency exit stairs only at the ends of each corridor. I was unable to find central exit stairs at the central elevator lobby. I assume that they counted the elevators as the required, second emergency exit for the corridors. I did not measure the corridors, but the travel distance to the emergency exits seemed excessive. The Inter-Continental design standards did not allow the use of elevators for exit in a fire emergency. Guest Room My suite consisted of a large guest room with a equally large bathroom. Room amenities were sadly lacking. There was no coffee maker. Bottled water was provided at $4.95 per bottle. Two small water glasses were provided at the small guest room refrigerator (not a Mini Bar as the refrigerator was empty). There were no other glasses provided in the suite. The bathroom has double sinks, make up mirrors, and the other normal Hotel bath equipment. The bath had marble walls and floors. The floor marble was polished marble. It was very slippery when wet and there were no grab bars or warnings provided. Bath marble is poorly matched. The shower floor is the inexpensive molded variety. At least the floor in the shower was not slippery marble. The shower door did not close properly. The bath had a large Jacuzzi style tub with several defective jets. The water flow at the jets was also not balanced. Water pressure in the shower, on the 16th floor, was poor. The toilet has a Sloan pressure system for flushing. It is effective office or commercial type toilet fixture, but not at all residential. There was a sign in the bath noting that linens would be changed only once every 3 days, unless special arrangements were made with the hotel. The message noted that this was due to the need to conserve water. While I salute the hotel's apparent concern for the environment, I also recognize that this results in a sunstantial reduction in hotel operating as well as a capital cost reduction for fewer pars (full sets of room linens) that was not reflected in the room rates. If the hotel was really concerned with water conservation, they would close all the outdoor water features, pools, etc. to reduce the evaporation losses in the desert environment. The hotel provides high speed, wired or wireless Internet connections in the rooms for an added charge of $11.99 per day. The cost to the hotel for this service is only a very small fraction of this charge, probably considerably less than $1.00 per room per day. It is the highest cost I have ever seen at a hotel for this service. Needless to say, I eschewed the usurious Internet rates at the hotel and utilized the free ebay wireless connections at the convention. There is a sofa located in the center of the suite. It has a cheap and unattractive green fabric. The sofa blocks the view of the lower part of the TV screen when viewed from the bed. There is a 27 inch color TV in an armoire at one end of the suite. The TV is 23 feet +/- from the head of the bed and no binoculars were provided. The sleep timer on the TV remote control was inoperable. The TV needs to be raised about 12 inches to be able to view the entire screen from the bed. There is a shelf in the armoire above the TV. There is a large hole in the back of the armoire above the shelf. It appears that the shelf was designed to hold some electrical/electronic aparratus that was missing in my suite. The lower part of the armoire contains 3 self opening drawers. When you open the lower cabinet doors, the drawers roll open, whether you want to open them or not. The acoutical insulation for the rooms was very inadequate. Slamming doors, plumbing noise and guests shouting in the corridors woke us several times during our stay. In retrospect, I have to wonder if fresh air for the rooms is being drawn under the entry doors from the corridors. Most modern Hotels have drop seals at the entry doors to provide compartmentalization for improved acoustics and fire safety. The room carpet was a monotonous, stained, tufted beige colored carpet that appeared to be well beyond its useful life. Our room, which was supposed to be a non-smoking room, smelled of stale cigarette smoke. There were ash trays located in the drawers of the bedside tables. Obviously, the Hotel had little concern for the fact that guests may smoke in rooms designated as non-smoking rooms. Housekeeping Hosuekeeping was excellent. The room was very clean without considering the worn state of the fabrics and furnishings. There was no dust on any surfaces in the room and the beds were well made. Bath linens were refolded and placed neatly. No linen changes seemed strange for a hotel charging more than $200 a night for a standard guest room. Restaurants Due to the exorbitant pricing at the restaurants in the hotel, we avoided them, as much as possible. Together with Joyce Banbury, we had organized a breakfast for the Education Specialist group attending eBay Live. The breakfast was held on June 14 in the Bayside Buffet restaurant. We had contracted with the hotel for a setup charge of $125 and, so we thought, a charge of $11.99 per person plus tip. To our surprise, we were charged $13.99 per person ($2 in excess of what was verbally agreed with the hotel Manager of Group Dining) for the meal plus an 18% service charge. Together with tax, it brought the actual charge per person to nearly $18. The 18% service charge provided each person with one glass of juice served by wait staff and the busing of soiled china and silver. 18% service charge for buffet service is ridiculous. The scrammbled eggs were dried out by the steam table and bore a visual resemblance closer to popcorn. The waffles looked good, but were soggy. I had a much better breakfast on Friday, at another hotel for $5.99. It was a full breakfast, well served and I left a 20% tip. I wonder if the hotel management believes that having smoking and non-smoking areas in a hotel restauant is possible due to the fact that cigarette smoke remains at the smokers table only and does not circulate throughout the restaurant and the hotel? Obviuosly, they do not agree with the Surgeon General's warnings on the dangers of second hand smoke. Convention/Meeting Spaces and other Public Areas Most of the guests were seated on the floors of the break out spaces for the meeting rooms due to the lack of adequate seating spaces. The only area I noticed with more than adequate seating was at the slot machines in the Casino. There were sufficient empty chairs there to line the walls of the corridors and meetings space lobbies. Thsi may be due to the fact that several local residents advised me that the Mandalay Bay slot machines were notoriously STINGY. Public area lighting was of dated design and often appeared to be poorly polished and maintained. I had a thought that some of the ceiling light fixtures looked as though they had been purchased at a \"used\" lighting store. Meeting room acoustic separation was very poor. The only advantage being that you could hear two meetings at the same time. It is obvious that the hotel installed movable partitions with inferior acoustical qualities. Conclusion The Mandalay Bay Hotel is in dire need of an extensive renovation. This hotel is in stark contrast to the newer the HOTEL at Mandalay Bay. The interior design, furniture, fixtures and equipemnt are far superior at the HOTEL and the room rates are only about 25% more than the standard room rates at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. Stay at the HOTEL. I suggest that you avoid the Mandalay Bay Hotel. Many other hotels on the Strip are much less costly than the Mandalay Bay Hotel."

    "content": "Just returned from a week's stay at Mandalay. (June 14-21) We had 2 rooms and an executive suite. After reading some of the negative reviews, I almost changed our reservation. I am happy to say that we were pleasantly surprised to see that those reviews were exaggerated and not completely true. I am a very picky traveler and yet I did not have any major problems with this hotel. I had stayed at other Vegas hotels before and was glad that this hotel measured up to the others. (with the exception of the suite that we had at the Bellagio....nothing could top that!) A few tips: Be aware that this hotel changes drastically on weekends. It becomes a \"mid 20's age group\" of guests who are ready to party for the weekend. This partying atmosphere continues poolside where you can see buckets of beer being delivered early in the morning. Weekends are when the pool is very crowded, creating a chair and towel shortage. We handled this problem by visiting other hotels and casinos on the weekend. By Sunday, the place was back to normal. Use the South Lagoon pool on busy days. Rooms: Regular rooms are very large and have great bathrooms. The suite added space and was great for gathering our whole group of 7 for drinks etc. Both rooms were clean, beds were OK. The decor needs to be updated and more comfortable bedding would be better too. Maids were friendly and brought robes and slippers upon request at no charge. Our view was the airport and the strip. Location: This hotel is at the end of the strip but easily accessible by tram to others. It was nice to return at night to this hotel after dealing with the crowds of people along the other strip hotels. I would stay at this location again. Casino: Clearly, this is the most spacious casino on the strip (best air circulation too) The minimum bets are high and the slots didn't pay much but the atmosphere is the nicest. Families: We had teenagers with us and enjoyed visiting the New York Hotel for the ESPN zone activities as well as the game areas. Also, cheaper food is available there too. The pools are great at Mandalay for all ages. The Burger Bar had the best burgers; Lupos Italian food was good and great pastries at the lobby lounge in the morning. Entertainment: Go see \"Love\" the Beatles cirque du soleil at the Mirage!!! Wander through the Venetian and Caesar's for fun. The Wax Museum is a quick hour of silly fun for all. Anywhere you go, you can find something to see and do. The adage \"pack half as many clothes and twice as much money\" is certainly true of Vegas. Live it up!!"

If you are there to gamble or go to the clubs, it is just so far off of the strip. The pool area was like college spring break and there wasn't a chair or even spot of concrete to be found at any of the pool areas when we got there - it was a busy weekend in Vegas, but we spent about 2 hours at the pool, with the first one stuffed onto one small speck of concrete until some room opened up, and we regretted even going to the pool in the first place. The rooms, lobby and casino are all very nice, but the location and disappointing pool atmosphere really ruined the experience for me."

Check in was very easy, and everyone was very helpful and kind. The rooms were beautiful. We had a view of the strip on the 33rd floor. Two beds and they both slept great. Well, one was for sleeping. (wink wink, Its Vegas! Right?) We ate at the buffet. It was awesome! Kind of expensive on Sunday, probably cause it was fathers day. As far as Vegas, we tore it up! Our friends got married at the Graceland Chapel. We saw two shows, a comedy show (can\u2019t remember where it was cause I was pretty intoxicated), and the other was Zumanity. It was pretty good, except for the cage-fighting scene (we won\u2019t go there). We partied at night at the Rum Runner and Red Square. Then slept all day at the pool. I don\u2019t know what all the other reviewers are complaining about, we always found four chairs. Gambled at old Vegas and Mandalay Bay. We had dinner at the Stratosphere. Which was probably the best dinner of my life. We did the gondola rides at the Venetian. As far as the complainers, some \u201cVegas\u201d advice, no matter where you go in Vegas, you have to caulk up a certain amount of \u201cdirty\u201d to it. There is no way that place can be spotless during a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year party! I can\u2019t wait to go back. I actually enjoy being broke until my next trip. I had it made, good friends, great view of the strip, great food, and an awesome girlfriend!"

    "content": "Mandalay Bay is a wonderful hotel and the rooms are large with enough space for two huge beds. The decor and cleanliness of the rooms you cannot fault. We were on the 10th floor and facing the strip and it was quiet the only noise was from other guests going back to the rooms early in the morning. The room had windows from floor to ceiling and the veiw was fantastic. The bathroom was huge with a tub and a walk-in shower and two wash basins. Also an endless supply of towels and sample bottles of shampoo, conditioner, body lotion etc. Plenty of wardrobe space with a safe deposit box, ironing board and iron. The room would of been perfect if you only had coffe making facilities. It became a real chore to go and get coffe first thing in the morning. We did however resort to room service a few times for our morning coffee. Starbucks was in the lobby but was always busy even at 7am. We ordered sandwiches from room service and the choice was very good and the trolly came with not only sandwiches but a whole array of extras like fries, crisps, salad and every condiment you would ever need and of course the large coffee pot. This was well worth the money and I would reccomend you do this as in the middle of the day the heat was exhausting and the coolness of your room was a comfort. The Mandalay is next door to the Luxor with a connecting walkway between the two and a Monorail that would take you to the Excaliber via the Luxor and back again. If you get off at Excaliber then it it a short walk to other hotels like the MGM, New York New York with walkways over the very busy roads. Mandalay Bay is a long way from places like Stratasphere and Mirage so be prepared to walk a lot, although they do not look far away beleive me it is a long walk. The casino's are all the same in whatever hotel you visit just a different theme in each one. This was our first visit to Vegas and we found it a bit intimidating to try out the tables as the Mandalay was hosting a poker tournament at the time and was very busy so you felt like a complete novice (which we were) so we stuck to the slot machine's. All in all Mandalay is a very good hotel but if you dont like walking then I would suggest you go to another hotel further down the strip."

    "content": "Stayed here for a conference from June 11 - 15. Not really a Vegas person, but had a wonderful time anyway and would recommend this resort. The property is massive and very far away from the rest of the strip, so it's suitable for those that just want to lounge by the pool, gamble and not do too much else. Either that or be there for a conference, like us, that keeps you so busy that there isn't time to leave the place! The food choices are a bit high-end but this is a more upscale property. I'm not really sure why people come to Vegas with children - it's just not a family place in my opinion - more of an adult disneyland. I have 2 teenagers and can see that it would be very expensive to eat out as a family - if I ever brought them (not likely). We ate at the buffet once and at the little pizza/sandwich place in the shopping area. Both were fine. We also ate at the food court at the Excalibur, at a trattoria in the Venetian and the Red & Blue - again no complaints. The maid service was excellent and consistent for us. It seemed like we got clean towels everyday, but am not bothered if we didn't. The little sign that states that you only receive clean towels on request, also says that this policy is in the interest of conservation and for environmental reasons. I've seen the same notices when travelling in Europe. When you think about the comsumptive nature of a place like Vegas, it seems like a small step in the right direction. Found the beds perfectly comfortable and the pillows really fluffy! The decor is a little worn and in need of updating but not too bad overall. Loved the size of the bathroom! Never had a chance to use the pool, so I can't really comment. Looked nice from the outside. Had a go at the slot machines in the casino and won a nice little sum - so that was a good experience! All in all, it was a pleasant stay. I guess my only negative comment would be the size of the hotel. The trek to the convention center from the 34th floor, at the very end of a very long hallway, was a bit much...we were exhausted by the end of our stay! And yet, I'm very happy that we stayed here rather than a nearby hotel - to have to commute even farther to the conference everyday and then schlep ourselves back would have made for an unpleasant visit. Have a good trip!"

We had dinner at the Border Grill, and while the food was good we never got the appetizer we ordered, and the waiter seemed to want to play with the other waiters more than serving his guests. Our room was fine, and the stip views from this hotel are some of the best. Also room service was very good here prompt ,friendly and was well prepared. The worst however was the pool area! When we arrive down stairs we were told that there were no towels avail for 2 hours. Then we searched for a chair for another 45 minutes. We had lunch at the pool and were served a turkey wrap with I kid you not raw bacon!! Also the small poor tasting cocktails were $11.50. This is not a good spot for families with children. The beach was line with drunk adults. It seems more like a pick up spot than a family area. The trash cans were so full the entire time the cocktail waitresses couldn't even throw trash way. I do not recomend this hotel!!"

The room was large, clean and way above average. My 2 complaints are the bed is very firm, but they did put extra blankets under the sheet to try to make it softer. It did't work. I also can't believe that on a Saturday morning there were no pool towls to be found anywhere?? Big problem as far as I am concerned. We ate at the breakfast buffet most every morning, it was great. Check in was about a 20 minute wait, no big deal. We had no problem with self parking and the pool chair problem that everyone is complaining about? We never had one problem getting a chair each day 10:00 or 11:00am. I will tell you to bypass the main pool and go straight up to the south lagoon, it was almost empty each day but Saturday. This hotel is stars in my book !!"

    "content": "I was in Vegas 10 years ago, but had the chance to go back with my new partner - her first time in Vegas. We had booked the Mandalay Bay over the internet and had got a bargain price to say the least - about 75% reduction on the room rate. We arrived on the 31st May from Zion National Park, arriving in the city at about 1700hrs. Parking at the hotel was so easy, and we even managed to get a spot near the lifts!!. The usual long walk to the Check-In area was interesting - Clare was blown away, nothing really prepares you for you first Vegas themed hotel. Check In couldn't have been easier, no queue at all (it was a Wednesday), the lady behind the desk was absolutely lovely, and a credit to the Hotel, she found us a room \"overlooking the strip\" - i took this with a big pinch of salt bearing in mind what we had paid for the room!. Check in took about 2 minutes (honestly!) - and we were at the room a few minutes later. Wow - what a room, what a view - looking directly down the strip through floor to ceiling, full width windows. The room was spotless, and immaculate. We stayed only two nights (strict fly drive plans) before heading to Death Valley and a huge culture shock. Didn't use the pool, but it looked great although rather busy, and we didn't eat at the hotel either. What we saw didn't appear too expensive for the quality, and access to the rest of the strip was no problem with the monorail - you're always going to walk a lot in Vegas. We even saw David Copperfield at the MGM - brilliant !! From our experience I would quite simply recommend the Mandalay Bay to anyone."

    "content": "Just returned 6/17 after spending 5 nights at the MB. The day before we left I e-mailed requesting a non smoking king bed to celebrate our 25 wedding anniversary. Got a nice reply back that our request was noted but nothing could be guarenteed. Arrived to a empty lobby shortly after midnight early 6/11. Check in clerk asked our name and then said Happy Anniversary. Told us she was upgrading us to a suite-strip view. After our check in was complete we tipped her $10 which she seemed suprised to receive, even told us it wasnt necessary. Suite was on the 29th floor non smoking king room with living and kitchen area. Room was beautiful, few stains on the carpet but probably the nicest room we have ever stayed in. Everything in good shape, only complaint was in regards to the hot tub. Filled it the first time, and saw a bundle of black hairs floating in the water. Must have come from the jets or drain. I do not fault the MB, I dont know that more they can do. The hairs were NOT in the tub before I turned the water on. We tipped $4.00 daily expect once when we honestly forgot. Interesting that that was the only day they forgot to leave us any washclothes and did not change the dirty water glasses. The third day 2 32oz of bottle water appeared in the room. I thought it was a nice touch until I read the note that if we used the water, we would be charge $4.95 for each bottle. We had housekeeping remove them the following day. We had a refrigerator and used it daily. Went to Whole Food Market and bought food for breakfasts each day. We had no problem finding room to sit at the pool. It may have made a difference that we went in the afternoons. Great hint*****take your own inner tubes from home or buy them off site. The beach store closest to the lazy river will blow your own tubes up free. Renting a tube is $20 a day or purchase them for $17. The pools are very busy and adults do NOT appreciate kids jumping in from the sides and splashing water everywhere! I did not feel that the lazy river was worthwhile, we have been in longer and visually nicer ones. The wave pool was nice, there is some construction going on by the wave pool. We ate twice at the Bayside Buffet. Food is expensive but nicely presented and we had no complaints. Casino was wonderful, Lots of nice signs to find your way around. Once you get your bearings it is easy to find your way around. Self parking garage is a distance away but as in Vegas-everything is a walk. Be careful driving in the garage. Directional signs are small and confusing. Do not purchase anything in the little store by the elevators, unless absolutely necessary. Prices are high. I thought about buying a Fuji disposable camera. They sell for $6-7 here in MI-MB wanted $19.95 for exactly the same camera. We got one at the Vons grocery store a mile off strip for $7.95. A choke point seems to be at the elevators on the casino level. There are 2 banks of elevators. One bank of 8 goes up to the about the 17 floor, the second set of 8 go from the 18 to 30th floor or so. Then there are a set of private elevators to the top bars, etc. It gets really busy in that area. We were amazed at all the children running around unsupervised. Could not believe it! People-please thing twice about bringing anyone under 18 to Las Vegas, it is not the place for them. More than once we were in the elevators with both boys and girls alone under the age of 10. Absolutely unbeliveable! Vegas is not Disneyland!!!! Only suggestion we would have for the Mandalay Bay would be to have some additional public sitting areas. There are only 2 couches on the Beach level in the corners by the escelators. I know this is Vegas and they want you in the casino's but it would have been nice to have an occasional sit in a quiet area outside or away from all the activity. We rented a car so being on the south end of the strip was not an issue. Mandalay is a very classy wonderful hotel. I would recommend it, and we had a very positive experience. Please e-mail with questions."

Especially when it is crowded. The beds were positively the worst I've ever experienced in a hotel room. They are very hard. The carpet was also filthy with multiple cigarette burns. Our towels were not changed daily, there was a sign in the bathroom that said you had to call the front desk if you wanted fresh towels. Unbelievable. For the high price I paid for this hotel, I expected much more. Other posters are correct when they say there is no wow factor to this hotel. Pay the extra $$ and stay at the Venetian. If I come to another confence here, I will stay at Luxor. I will not stay here again. The positives: food at Raffles (the 24 hr joint) was very good, and the portions were pretty good for the price. The bell desk, baggage people, and valet were very friendly and answered all my questions and treated us very well."

    "content": "I stayed with my wife and 3 kids and we had a good time at Mandalay Bay Jun 10-14! I have read the other reviews and there are many items of bad misinformation...some were correct....let me explain. . We checked in on a Sat morning 10am - no lines at all - and was told no rooms available and was given a number to call they said check back in 2hrs...I called in 30 mins and one was ready!! Lobby was clean and well taken care of no trash! We stayed on the 27th floor...mountain view...the rooms was large 2 Queen beds and accomodating..bathroom and tub larger than most hotels. Carpet wasnt as bad as everyone was complaining about. We asked for a refrigerator and they brought one up no problem without a charge! Internet is 11.99 a day. No coffee maker or mini bar. Maid service was hit or miss...one day they didnt even empty the trash...next day it was fine. towel, blankets were sent up if we asked for more. Since its the farthest hotel on the South Strip....expect to walk or take a cab everywhere..(Monorail or trolley not worth it if you have 4-5 people.) Cabs run $10-12 to get in a central location) you can take a free tram to Luxor or Exclaiber. Food at Mandalay Bay is EXPENSIVE ...the hamburger at the pool is 9.50( not $20)my kids split it...but going out to dinner at any of the restaurant with 3 kids is very expensive. There is a Mc Donalds and Subway for lunch across the street but other then then that you have to eat there. 3.50 for a muffin and bagel . 10 for sandwiches. No food court or take out type restaurants as they have in other hotels!! The food at Raffles the hotel restaurant is bad ..dont bother.....we went there and had bad service and crappy food. PASS. Food in general for a family in Las Vegas is expensive. The Pool was GREAT...Yes its was crowded on the weekends but that was expected. Monday and Tuesday was wide open!! It opens and 8am and closes at 7pm..too early in our opinion. There are 4 different pools to choose from and never had an issue. We got there on Sunday at 7:45 and there was 5 people in line...Monday around 9am and there were plenty of chairs!! Drinks are expenive at the pool 6.50 for a beer $10 or 11 for a mixed drink. I went to the store across the street and brought a cooler with \"drinks \"with me!!...a few time the water was dirty..mainly the Lazy River pool, but overall not an issue. Kids had fun there.... Didnt use the Spa or the workout room so no opinion on those. Overall...the biggest downfall is location (too far away from other hotels) and lack of reasonable priced food..we ended going to NY NY for much more reasonable priced food. Casino was fine ......I won so it was better...(made up for all the expensive food) We enjoyed our stay at Mandalay would probably try the Mirage or Aladdin next time....based on location."

    "content": "I'm sorry so many other reviewers didn't have as great a time as we had at the Mandalay Bay! We were there (a group totaling about 20) from June 1-6th and each and every one of us would return in a heartbeat. Check in for everyone seemed to be a breeze. A few people arrived hours before the official check in time and made it to their rooms with no problems. My husband and I came around 2:30pm and had no problems checking in. The girl at the front desk was extremely pleasant and we made it up to our suite just fine. The suite was very large...not the greatest view but we weren't too bothered by that. The bathroom and closet space was wonderful. The rest of our room seemed to be quite clean. We absolutely loved the pool! Yes, it get extremely crowded, especially if you are staying over the weekend (Monday and Tuesday of our stay it was pretty empty) but each and every day we found ourselves a spot somewhere. Most of the time there were about 10 of us all together. Some had chairs and others didn't...which is fine...because at 106 degrees you have to go in the water! We had a blast in the lazy river and wave pool...if you find you are not having a good time in either one of these two places then there is something wrong. It's your vacation, the weather is always perfect, and you have your choice of pools to go in! I can't imagine someone not having fun at the pool area. The food was excellent. Going in to this vacation you HAVE to know that things are going to be expensive. But it's a vacation!!! You have to expect that. We had a WONDERFUL dinner at the China Grill. Great food. We loved the House of Blues and had dinner and breakfast there (2 for 1 breakfast). They had a great band that entertained us for hours. The buffet was great for breakfast, as was Raffles. We also hit up the Burger Bar in Mandalay Place. Good burger and beer. Here you can find very high end (expensive) restaurants as well as some very decently priced places. The casino is great. Less smokey than most places (in fact, the hotel as a whole smells so much better than any other hotel on the strip!). We found the staff everywhere to be extremely pleasant! Everyone we spoke with was friendly and very helpful. I'm so sorry to read some of these reviews. Maybe some people go to these places and expect absolute perfection. You have to know that not everything is going to be perfect (no matter how much you are paying). I mean, we look at it as a relaxing vacation and we really try not to let too much get us down. You are in Las Vegas afterall! How can you not like this place?! We hope to return to the Mandalay Bay many times and I hope it doesn't disappoint us like it has some other people. We had a wonderful time this time around and we hope for the same next time!"

    "content": "We just returned from a 5 night stay at Mandalay Bay (5/28 - 6/2/06). We were quite excited to stay there, as this hotel is higher-rated and more expensive than where we usually stay, but got a good deal on Travleocity by booking months ahead. We have always wanted to stay here, but what a disappointment! Check in was an absolute ZOO. We arrived around noon and the weekend crowd was lined up all over the counters (checking out) and signs said no check ins until 2:00. We had to wait in line to check our luggage (although the bell staff was pleasant and doing the best they could in the midst of hoards of people). We decided to wait until later to come back and check in, so we returned about 3:30 to find lines as bad as they were in the morning. We went back around 5:00 p.m. and the lines were much reduced, but we still had to wait. The check-in guy was nice, but didn't give us any of the maps or other things our friends got when they checked in the next day. We did get the non-smoking room and bed choice we picked, which does not always happen. We were given the last room at the end of the hall on the 17th floor. After check in, we called the bell desk and the luggage as brought up in less than the promised 30 minutes. The bell dept. was the only one that stood out as far as good service during our entire stay. The room was OK. On the plus side, it is bigger than most we have stayed in and has double closets, \"regular\" hangers and plenty of them, an in-room safe, and a spectacular bathroom. On the minus side, the carpet was disgusting - burned, stained and dirty, the top drawer in the dresser would not stay closed unless the door to the armoire was closed (making it difficult to use the other drawers as well as just being annoying), and the housekeeping was below par. The pools were nice, but everything I saw posted in prior reviews was true, true, true. If you want a chair, you MUST be in line when the pool opens at 8:00 a.m. The line starts forming about 7:15 - not a fun way to spend your vacation. Many people ended up spreading their towels right on the concrete - not enough room on the beach to put a towel as all the room is taken up by chairs. Heeding reviews, we brought our own innertubes for the lazy river. $5 for two at WalMart and a little lung power saved us big bucks - we gave them to kids on our last day. We also stayed away from food and beverages - a guy from England told us that one hamburger from the pool grill cost $20. Our smartest move was to buy baguettes at Paris and carry them with us (the day before), then buy coffee from the Red, White and Blue place inside before we got in line for the pool. Even then, 2 cups of coffee (just plain coffee - nothing fancy) cost $7. The pools themselves were nice, the wave pool was fun, but like everything else at the propery, were dirty - lots of things floating in all the water (pools, wave poll, lazy river) - cigarette butts (lots), cellophane, other human trash in addition to the normal pool items like sticks and bugs. The chairs were not well maintained, either. Many were missing slats and our first day we got one that could only be used flat. The chairs and pool grounds also were dirty - chairs were stained, cigarette butts and matches). The service was bad - not indifferent, but actually rude at times. I ordered a drink from a cocktail waitress. When she came back with other drinks, but not mine, I ordered again. When she came back without it again, she simply stared at me like she had never seen me before. I would have filed a complaint if I could have found any other hotel/casino employee anywhere near the entire section I was in, but couldn't. Beverage service on other occassions was spotty - sometimes good, but other times, not a waitress to be found. Also, the housekeeping in the common areas was not good - dirty ash trays and empty glasses everywhere and many slot machines had ashes covering the screens - gross. Absolutely not what we expected from what it supposed to be one of the better properties around. Luxor next door was much better, even though under common ownership, but Excalibur has been allowed to degenerate to the point that it is disgusting. The landscaping is beautiful - they need to spend as much time on cleaning as they do on working on the grounds. And their employees all need customer service training. The people at the pool were uniformly rude. As to restaraunts, we at the breakfast buffet one morning ($30 for 2) and the parade of incompetance continued. We got there at 7:10 - it opened at 7:00. When I went to get in line to have an omlette made, the guy said that he had no pans, so no omlettes. When I asked him when the pans would arrive, he said he had no idea. So I walked around the rest of the buffet and got some fruit (which was wonderful). About 10 minutes later, I went back and there were people in line for omlettes. The guy only had 2 pans (most places run at least 4) and he was terrible - while cleaning out one pan, he caught his rag on fire and SLOW. The omlette was not worth the 30 minutes it took to get and breakfast was not worth $15 per person. Another day we tried House of Blues for breakfast - much better! Still not cheap, but we had a 2-for-1, so it was a good deal. The stuffed french toast was awesome! And the check stub was another 2-for-1 for the next day. We also ate dinner at Mon Ami Gabi (Paris) on their patio. We both had steaks that were good (nothing stellar, but reasonable - $22 each, and it came with more fried potato shreds than most people can eat). The bread was delicious and the view of the Bellagio fountains was nice, but the traffic noise is extremely load and we had the misfortune of being in the restaurant at the same time as two increadibly LOUD, obnoxious women from New York. The staff did nothing to ask them to keep it down, even when comments were made by people stitting at several surrounding tables. One of our party has hearing problems and missed pretty much all of the dinner conversation. One night we ate at Chin Chin (NYNY). We had eaten here last year and it remains excellent. The portions are HUGE, so definately spilt your entree with someone else. Everything (steamed rice, white rice) is a la carte here, but you get tons and tons of food and if you spilt your entree, you can eat for $30-40 for dinner for 2 people (not including tip) - and still have leftovers (money much better spent than on the MBay breakfast buffet). We did the video check out as we normally do and had no problems. I got a receipt in the mail less than a week later. Bottom line is - we will not be back! New York New York, MGM Grand, Mirage, TI, Paris, Aladdin - we would stay again at any one of these other places before we would return to MBay, much less pay a premium to do so. Also, their comps were stingy. We played less money and less time at NYNY last year and got much better service and more free stuff. I doubt that we will ever play much at any of their properties. Perhaps Harrah's tightness is spreading to others, but we got fewer comps for more cash through the machines than we ever have. Also, when I went to get comps credited to our bill, the lady was rude and neglected to mention that we had cash back on the account even though she was told we were checking out. I had to think of it myself and go back to ask specifically to get the money we had coming to us."

It looked like any other fancy hotel. One thing I did like were the room sizes. Very large and spacious. We had a mountain view (or so they called it) but it really was a view of the pool. Not that big of a deal. The restaurants were very expensive. The one restaurant we did find that we like was the Red, White and Blue. They had good prices and good food. The pool was absolutely beautiful, but was not open at the time we were there. We did love the Shark Reef at the hotel though. Very informative and amazing. Definetly worth the $16.00 a person. I'm not saying he had a bad experience but, next time we go to Vegas I will definetly be staying somewhere more mid-strip. I absolutely loved The Venetian and my husband loved The Mirage.

    "content": "We stayed at Mandalay Bay from May 24th -31st thru the Memorial Day weekend.My annual convention dictates we visit each year during the busy holiday weekend so we were prepped for the crowds.My event was at MGM but we were curious enough about the \"4 Star\" Mandalay Bay to stay there. Check-in Wed. nite @ 10pm took less than 5 minutes.Our confirmed stripview Exec. suite ended up being a partial stripview with an \"awesome\"view of the airport.The suite was tired looking but clean although the dim lighting made it difficult to identify each shade and origin of stain within the suite.The bathroom and jacuzzi were large and well lit until just the bathroom lights went out one nite for about 8 hours.Who needs light to get dressed for Vegas anyway??The view from our bed to the \"lowend\" TV was obstructed by the couch so we moved it.Who watches TV in bed in Vegas anyway?? The rooms were serviceable and kept clean by the staff but they were in need of a mini-bar and/or coffemaker.I got my daily run in by dodging the traffic crossing Las Vegas Blvd each day going to the liquor store and mini Mart. But who needs food and water anyway when you can just order room service and wonder if you will catch your show in time. One day during peak pool time,our room key magically stopped working so we took a break from the sun by standing in a long line at the front desk to rectify the problem.In line we discovered others with the same problem. With new keys in hand we didn't even mind the massive exodus of new arrivals to the elevator banks.Thoughts of returning to the Pool were out of the question as we were positive our chairs had been scavenged and sold to the highest bidder. We did not technically eat at Mandalay Bay except for the occasional jumbo colossal green martini olive and whatever Starbucks had to offer for breakfast each AM. Two exceptional meals were eaten @ MGM. First was Nob Hill noted for it's S.F. cuisine and the other was Sea Blue with it's \"jet fresh\" seafood. The food court at the Luxor kept us content between the high-end meals at MGM and the Discus Dental convention food. The Mandalay Bay casino area was clean,lively and not too smokey.Taxi lines moved efficiently and the slots paid out often.The Palm's slots were tight.We had been warned about the pool so we awoke early each day to stand in line before it opened daily at 8 AM. Once you had staked your claim to a chair just don't expect to ever leave it lest it disappear during a quick trip to the bathroom. Once the chairs filled in,then all available sand was taken and by Sunday,all available concrete was covered with towels. I felt like royalty with our chairs as it was standing room only. Imagine Bourbon St. with a beach. The most renowned pool in Sin City had become Sardine City. Fortunately the waitresses were friendly and pleasant despite their inability to find space to walk in.My occasional walk to the Bungalow Bar was refreshing to check out the scene and the lay of the land. On Sunday cabanas were rumored to be in the $1,000's. All in all,the controlled chaos wasn't that bad but I did feel soory for the families that showed up at noon with kids & rafts in tow wandering around for a spot never to be had. A brief respite was found at the South Lagoon Pool which doesn't fill up until around 10AM but the vibe is much more relaxed.All pool staff at both venues were pleasant and helpful. Next year we may try the Four Seasons or return to the friendly,marble confines of the Venetian. Mandalay Bay is what it is.Not bad but not great either.Since timing is everything in life,you just have to pick the right time to \"live large\" @ Mandalay Bay."

Drinks are around $11 at the pool. I travel a lot. You can read my other reviews....and see that I am not usually negative, but this trip to Mandalay was BECAUSE they presented themselves as family oriented with the waterpark, the shark reef and the aquarium...... Each of these items sucked, were too crowded and cost way too much. A large part of the pool area has been fenced off for Four Seasons guests only....The Four Seasons is on the top floors of the Mandalay. Rooms were reasonably clean, and except for the buffet, we liked the restaurants in the hotel. Las Vegas isn't for families. They make that clear. When Mandalay talked up the water park and the aquarium I hoped that the kids would have something to do....They don't. The waterpark closes at 7pm. Sorry mandalay...never again."

I have previously stayed at NYNY, TI, and the Mirage. Out of all of these hotels, I would rate Mandalay Bay as number 4. Arrived at MB at about 8pm. We were greeted (by the doorman? bellhop?) and the gentleman took our bags for us. Very nice. He took us straight to the check in desk, where there was no line, so we walked right up. We asked for a strip view and were told by Minnia (I think that's right) that she didn't think there were any left, but she checked and saw there was one. Do you want it, she asked? Um, yes. Didn't I just ask you for one? She then told us we owed over $400 for the 4 nights, when we had already paid a deposit of $108, so we really only owed $326. We finally got that straightened out. She ran our credit card and then asked us if we had another form of payment, as the cc was denied. We told her no and that there was enough on the cc and that it should have gone through. We were in the process of calling the credit card company when she told us that she had added in $100/night for \"incidentals.\" We told her we didn't want them and to take them off and that that's why the cc wouldn't go through. She ran it again and it went through fine. We were given room 219 on the 25th floor. The room looked clean, except for the carpet. I am not exaggerating when I say that there were stains on every inch of the carpet. Some of them were cigarette burns, I think. There were dust bunnies all around the edges of the carpet. However, the bathroom and beds were immaculate. Speaking of the beds, we had wanted only one bed and were given a room with double beds. It would have been nice if Minnia had told us that when we were checking in. Maybe that's why she had asked us if we wanted it? I sure wish she would have said something. The beds took up a lot of space in the room and made it look small. My SO asked me if I was happy with it and I said \"no\" but I didn't feel like going back down to the desk to switch rooms just because it had an extra bed. Plus, we'd had a terrible flight previous to this (stuck on the runway for 2 hours and 40 minutes due to previous delays and weather problems) so we were exhausted. We unpacked and went downstairs to grab a bite to eat. When we went back to our room later to go to sleep, we realized the beds were hard as a rock. Both of them. Yay for us. I have never in my life felt mattresses like these. They were so rigid and uncomfortable that I only got a couple hours of sleep. It was terrible. I cannot stress that enough. Why didn't I switch rooms? Because I had already unpacked everything! And I have a LOT of stuff (being that I am a woman)! All of my toiletries were laid out, clothes were hung up and put in dresser. Everything, and I mean everything, was out of my suitcases. My SO had unpacked as well, and didn't want to go through the hassle (sp?) of packing and unpacking again. So, against my better judegement, we kept the room. While the bathroom was clean, the fixtures are in need of replacing. They were no longer as functional as I'm sure they used to be (ex: the handle on the toilet was so hard to flush, you had to put all of your weight on it in order to make it work). That got annoying after 3 days. Also, the lighting was very poor. It seemed like a bulb was burned out, but that wasn't the case. The bedroom was the same way. I don't know if they are trying to conserve electricity or what but it was difficult to read anything there. One day, I had a headache, so I sent my SO down to the casino to gamble and said I'd call on the cell phone if I felt better. I told my SO to put the privacy sign on the door, as I was going to take a nap (we had left the room at 8 a.m. and returned at 1 pm and it had yet to be cleaned and I didn't want to be disturbed). I was sleeping when I received a phone call from my SO checking in to see how I was. My headache was still there, so I was going to sleep a bit more. I fell back asleep and was woken up a little while later by the door opening. I called out my SO's name. No response. Again, I called. Still no response. I'm half asleep, so not thining too clearly. Turns out, it was the maid! She had come into the room even with the privacy sign on!! What if I wasn't decent or something? She apologized and asked if I wanted her to clean the room. I told her no. She left for a minute and then came back to ask if she could take out the trash. Okay, I told her. She did that, gave me fresh towels, and then proceded to use the phone in my room. Nice! Rumors that you have to fight to get a lounge chair by the pool are true. The first morning I was there, I got up early and got down to the beach by 8:45 (they open at 8). Not a singal chair could I find. Ridiculous! The next day, I got up at 6:30 a.m. to try again. I got down to the pool at 7:50 to find at least 200 people in line already. Crazy!! I thought for sure I wouldn't find a spot, but I did. Granted, it wasn't a great spot, but at least I was able to get chairs. I was talking with some people in line and we all agreed that the pool situation left a lot to be desired. As I stated before, I have stayed at the MIrage. They have a nice pool and I never had to fight to get a chair there. Also, the lifeguard was rude to my friend and I (went with 8 other people). As we were standing in the wave pool, this Ken doll look-a-like came up and told us we either had to move or get out. That same friend that I was with at the pool and I were waiting in the lobby of the hotel for some of our other friends, and she was smoking. A security guard came up to her and told her \"You can't smoke here, sir.\" My friend is, and looks like, a woman. That's funny because the bellhop had said that she could the day that we checked in. Then, later that same night, as my SO and I were walking to our room, we smelled marijuana. It was coming from one of the rooms next to ours. I called the front desk because I can't stand that smell. The funny thing is, they weren't surprised and didn't seem to care!! \"All I can do is send up security to check it out.\" They never did, though. The reason I know that is because you can hear everyone walking in the hallway and I never heard anyone until later that night (at least 1 1/2 hours afterwards). God forbid you smoke a cigarette in the lobby, but smoking marijuana in the room is okay. Lovely! Yikes, I seem to have gone on a tangent. Sorry about that. I do have some good things to say about the hotel: the lobby is beautiful, slots weren't too tight, Raffles cafe had good food at decent prices, it wasn't too crowded because it's at the end of the strip, and most of the people that worked there were very nice. I was fortunate that I only had to pay $100/night for the nights I stayed. It is worth that much (just make sure to check out your bed before you unpack) but no more."

The property is beautiful; there is a fresh feel to all the public areas, even cigarette smoke isn't noticeable. The pool area is crowded, but we always found a pair of lounges in the sun without too much effort. The pools themselves are great -- so massive and plentiful that crowding is not a concern. The restaurants we experienced were great; the buffet was as good as any in town, and the Burger Bar, though very popular, offered great service and better food. I'd definitely stay here again; few Strip properties have more to offer than Mandalay Bay."

There was a 10 min wait to check in and received a Honeymoon suite on the 19th floor for an extra $25 a night. I was growing sceptical prior to my arrival due to some of the other reviews I read, however I must disagree with most every negative review. Our room was very clean and kept that way for our entire stay. All of the food we had there was excellent and reasonibly priced for Vegas. Had dinner @ Mix on Fri, a bit pricey but the food was great and view was even better. Ask for an outside table! Visited the Spa twice during the week and it was awesome. Great massage and great amenitites. Did the pool thing everyday, and while it was packed my wife and I got great seats everyday. Maybe we just got lucky. The 12 dollar drinks were for the birds but I was on vacation so I really didn't give a damn. The only real negative in my opinion would be with the gaming. I experienced some of the most stuck up and rude pit bosses and dealers I ever seen. The poker room was very nice but didn't offer much of a variety. All in all Mandalay Bay was a great experience. Not as crowded as some of the other center strip hotels, but it got really Stuffy towards the weekend if you know what I mean."

But happily our stay there was a very enjoyable one On arrival we checked in straight away, but were told that a strip view room was not available, we were disappointed (given a room overlooking the pool area, which was ok - but not what we had expected). But the next day the front desk staff couldn't have been more helpful, they arranged for our room to be swapped for one with a strip view on the 23rd floor. The views were fantastic and looked straight down the strip, marvelous. Both the rooms (our 1st night one and our replacement one) were very clean, bedding and towels spotless. Our room was cleaned every day, there was never any problems. The pool area was busy, and yes you did need to get there early, which wasn't a problem for us.We sat around the lazy river managing to sit where we wanted to each day. Pool was clean and very relaxing in the hot weather. My only real moan is the lack of elevators in the self parking area, we did have to wait quite awhile on some occasions, two elevators isn't reallly enough for a hotel of this size. I have visited Vegas 4 times now over the last few years. Staying in different hotels on the strip, I would have no hesitation in staying at Mandalay Bay again in the future."

Upon arrival the check in was quick and easy. The staff was efficient and friendly. She gave us a wonderful view of the strip on the 24th floor, which is nice because the elevator ride doesn't take to long. Most hotels pump in oxygen, but the Mandalay Bay pumps in the best smelling oxygen! Every time we entered the hotel we would take a deep breath and smile. The pool area was magnificent. Made you feel like you were at a resort in the caribbean. Yes, you do need to get down to the pool by 8:30am or you wouldn't get a spot. But that is normal for most popular vacations spots. After being up all night we still managed to get to the pool earily and nap there. Drinks at the pool were expensive, but we had to splurge and buy one every day. Otherwise we packed water or cocktails in a small thermos in our beach bag. The casino was nice. Very upper class with out the uppety rich people who nromally frequent the nicer hotels. Mandalay Bay's average age was 21-45 ish out to have a good time. Every night there was entertainment in the main casino bar. Gambled a little and won, Seems pretty easy if you know when to quit. We mostly ate outside the hotel. One because I like a change of pace and because there are plenty of good, reasonable restraunts out there. IE..Gonzolez Y Gonzolez (Mexican in New York New York) Fanelli's (Italian in the Stratosphere) We also went to \"Zumanity\" A Cirq Du Sole production. This show is very racey and deffinately for the open minded. I loved it. I am a travel agent and have a pretty realistic view of the travel industry. The hotel was booked solid and the service was fine. I would recomend this hotel to my clients."

    "content": "I will start w/the positives: 1. Despite several reviews stating otherwise, our check in was perfect. Short lines and pleasant staff. We were given a suite with a gorgeous view of the Strip..and were happy..for a while (see below). This first room was clean and spacious and we didn't have any of the cleanliness problems others had. 2. There are a TON of restaurants in this hotel, including Raffles, which is open 24/7. After several nights of walking around other hotels after 11pm and being SHOCKED that none had all night decent eateries, we quickly learned to save late night bites for our own hotel. This was very disappointing for a city that parties till the wee hours. 3. The pools are all really nice and for the MOST part almost kid free (sorry parents but Vegas isn't a place for children). We simply put our towels on the edge of the Lazy River the day we coudlnt' get a chair. This worked out much better actually because we could just dip our toes inthe pool and lay by the river's edge. The next pool day we easily found a chair. The waitresses were more than attentive and I enjoyed it thouroughly. It is a very young crowd--everyone was wanting to \"be seen\". 4. This hotel isn't cheesy like some of the others (Excalubur) and had a nice open, airy feeling to it. The casino was more cheery than others and didn't smell like a tobacco factory either. The negatives: 1. That first clean room, soon turned \"icky\" about 6am the morning after check in. Our \"suitemates\" came home and really screamed it up, declarinig how wasted they were and after waking us up w/their noise, proceeded to smoke on our non smoking floor. with just a door between us, the noise and smoke might as well been in our room. We called to complain and the front desk attendant told me \"Yes, it is a non smoking floor, but NV law makes us put an ashtray in everyroom (to not discriminate against smokers?? you've got to be kdding me..this IS a non smoking room, is it NOT?) and that is it were \"botering me\" we'd have to switch rooms. Which we did. 2. The second room was better I assumed b/c it was NOT a suite so I thought \"there is less chance of hearing myneighbors\". I was wrong. We once again heard EVERYTHING from the partying group of guys next door AGAIN -- right down to the tv shows they watched to them puking in the bathroom. THE WALLS ARE PAPER THIN!!!!! There was also a wad of gum in the sheets. Intead of them changing it, they handed my husband a sheet so \"he could do it\". OK.... 3.Location could be better..if you want to be in a quieter part of town, then this is the place for you. I wanted to be closer to shops, etc so I found this hotel a bit off the beaten strip. I would prefer the location of Caesar's Palace or something next time. The strip is not easily walkable, as there is a bit of distance from one end to another. And in 98 degree heat, who can handle that??? The Indifferent 1. The prices seemed neither expensive or cheap to me..I didn't expect Vegas to be cheap, and I live in Boston where the prices are similiar (I have paid 11.00 at a bar in town, so 11.00 for pool side service seemed normal to me). 2. Gambling minimums also seems normal to me. We took a walk to Barbary Coast the nights we wanted to gample b/c I knew the stakes would be higher in the higer end casinos--its just how it is. I am not a big gambler to me, so this was just \"whatever\" for me. All in all, I would stay here again if I went back to Vegas but would like to try the Bellagio or Venetian or Caesars first."

    "content": "First, there seems to be some confusion about the Mandalay Bay. There are THREE hotels on the property: 1. The Mandalay Bay Resort 2. \"The Hotel\" at Mandalay Bay 3. The Four Seasons I stayed at the Mandalay Bay Resort--which is where I had stayed previously. To say it was a disappointment is a huge understatement. I had stayed there five years ago and remember it as having excellent service, plush rooms, and lots of little touches that make a resort hotel stand out. Not this time. Yes, the rooms were still large, as are the bathrooms. But, the beds have icky polyester bedspreads, the towels were worn and smelled like chemical cleaner, no more robes in the rooms, carpet looks tired and worn. Seemed clean enough but just no ambiance. The service at the front desk was excellent. Friendly and fast. There's one plus. The pool area. Disasterous. The pool area is crammed with chairs and yet there aren't enough for the size hotel. As another poster stated, you had to be there by 8 a.m. to get a chair. When you're paying $300+ a night, I don't think it's too much to expect that you can actually have a chair by the pool. The lounges are so close together that they literally touch--so, you better like the person sitting next to you. If you are willing to pay, you can \"rent\" a cabana. The weekday rental price was between $250 and $650 \"depending on location.\" Trust me, there is no location that is worth $650. And, I heard a rumor that on Saturday the prices go up to $500 to $1000. The pool area itself is not well staffed. As a result by about 1 p.m. there is trash everywhere. Getting a drink was hit or miss. Oh, and if you actually get the drink, be prepared to pay. A frozen daquiri in a little plastic cup--$11.50!!!!! Oh, and the pools were so crowded that the water was actually WARM. Ick. Again, if you are willing to pay, you can go to the Morea Beach Club--another \"exclusive\" part of the resort. But I don't think you should have to pay to lay by the pool--not at $300 a night. The casino area is very nice. And, the best thing about this resort is the restaurant selection. The spa, on the other hand, has jacked up its prices to the point that it's just not worth it. I'm sorry but a 50 minute massage for $130??? Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to spend when I feel like I'm getting a special experience, but everything at the Mandalay is so \"average\" now that it's not worth it. My personal theory is that they have taken what used to be the service standards for the entire property and are now applying them only to the more \"exclusive\" \"The Hotel.\" I will not stay here again."

I would pick Bellagio any day over the Mandalay Bay, but it was not as horrible as some of the reviews say. We booked a standard suite and were upgraded to an executive suite at check in. This was a nice surprise.The room was very large with a great view of the airport. Unlike some people this did not bother us as we do not spend a lot of time looking out our windows while we are on vacation. However, one point I will make is this hotel is Very close to the airport. You will hear air traffic from your room and from the pool. The bathroom had a huge jetted tub that we did not use as it appeared dirty(hair, dirt). It looked like the jets needed replaced as they were very discolored. We arrived on Friday about noon and there were no empty chairs of any kind available around the entire pool, beach, lazy river, or eating area. We finally layed our things against a wall and just went for a quick swim. This was a dissappointment to me as with all of the talk of what a great water area they have, you would think it could accomadate for the large number of guests. Friday night we ate at RM Seafood. The food was wonderful. The menu was amazing and the service was exceptional. Saturday we had couples massages at the spa. We both enjoyed the service and the spa was nicely appointed. With a $60 or more service you can have access to the facility all day. There are hot tubs, steam room, plunge pool and amenities to fix yourself up after your treatment. Sunday we were able to find chairs at the pool. I agree with the others who say 11.50 for a pina colada is excessive. Overall no one was rude, the bed was comfortable, and RM Seafood was wonderful. But, for the money I would go to Bellagio."

Prior to discovering the stains, we had contacted housekeeping 4 times in two hours and non one ever came. We retuned down stairs and were assigned another room overlooking the air duct despite the request for a view room (room booked 4 months prior). We were offered a suit with one bed....priblem, there were 3 of us. No thanks. A rude service manager asked us what it was that we wanted. She was clearly irritated despite our effort to handle the situation diplomatically up until that point. They gave us a third room with a decent view and agreed to switch the room the next day. Ok fine. We get to the room and the stinch of bleach is so strong, we ultimately just decide to leave our bacgs and head out for the evening. By now we have spent nearly 3 hours trying tp secure a room. It just seemed like the hotel was overwhelmed by the number of people it caters to. There was also a convention and two of the elevators were not operable...leaving only a few elevators for about 300 people. Keep in mind that only cerrtain elevators go to certain floors, so what a mess. It took us 20 minutes to get our car from the valet. This place was just a chaotic mess. I have stayed at the Venetian (good place), Mirage, even lower end places like Frontier and Tropicana. I would not stay here again. I did enjoy the Coral Reef bar and the restaurant called Raffles, but the hotel accomodations , service and attitude of the staff was pretty poor. Save your money and stay somewhere else. I have stayed at Mirage several times and overall service was much better for less than mandalay Bay."

When we arrived check in was fine (there was a problem but with the people we booked through and not the hotel). The room was large, the bathroom was large, all very clean. The maid came everyday and couldn't be faulted. I noticed that the decorators were on our floor the day we left and through the week carpets were being taken up and replaced in the casino, so even if the hotel is a little tired (it has been up some years now), it is slowly being re-vamped. The buffet breakfast was fantastic and approx $14 each, which considering the choice and the amoint of juice and coffee that was included wasn't bad. The pool areas were fab, yes maybe a little crowded, but the Mandalay is a large hotel. We always found a chair and there were 6 of us. At the weekend go up to the Southern pool to avoid the busy beach area. My only realy gripe with this hotel was the prices, the cocktails were $11.50 which seemed a bit excessive. We ate at the pool restaurant which was nice, and we ate at border grill and had a lovely mexican meal. If you have booked into the Mandalay don't worry about the bad reviews, the hotel is fine, and at the end of the day, does anyone go to Vegas to spend vast amounts of time in their rooms???? Also, have a meal in the Four Seasons which is located behind the Mandalay (Vegas's best kept secret), we had a fantastic wedding meal there."

    "content": "After I booked my trip to Las Vegas I came to this web site and I read quite a few negative reviews about Mandalaly Bay and quite frankly I was very nervous. We stayed at Mandalay bay from May 7-11. The complaints ranged from being dirty, rude staff, noisy, and poor customer service. I am glad to say that I did not have any of the above problems whatsoever. From the moment we got there everything was great. During check-in, which was not long at all, I asked about possible upgrades and they gave us a suite with a strip view for no extra charge. The room was beautiful and large with a couch and lounge chair. The bathroom was awesome! Very spacious. One of my concerns was being at the far end of the strip. It really wasn't too bad at all, especially with the tram from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur. It ran about every five minutes or so. The other useful thing is that there is a bus that runs up and down the strip and it costs $2 a ride or you can buy an all day pass for $5, which I reccomend. It does take a little bit longer but it can take you all of the way down to Fremont street, which would be a $20-$30 taxi ride. The bus trip does take an hour but that could have been due to construction down by the Stratosphere. and buses run very frequently. The only negative thing that I could have about the hotel were the high minimums on the blackjack tables, $10, and the lack of affordable restaurants. They do tend to be on the expensive side. But both of these negatives were not a big deal as well. There are food courts in the Luxor and Excalibur with restaurants like Quizno's, McDonald's, and other cheaper places to eat and the Tropicana is a short distance away as well and they have $5 blackjack tables all day. Now to the best part of the hotel was the pool. The wave pool was incredible!! It opens around 8 and there was no problem getting lounge chairs if you get there around 10 or so. There was also a lazy river and a few other smaller pools as well. You could either rent a tube for $20 a day, which is nice quality, or you can buy a tube for $15. It is not as nice but it gets the job done and you can keep it and bring it down each day. The one drawback is that a margarita at the pool is $11.50 and a bottle of beer is around $6. I will most definitely go back to stay at the Mandalay Bay!!!!"

Not only was the guest staff very pleasant and the rooms spacious and clean, but there are tons of things to do without leaving the building. The shark reef was a lot of fun and we literally spent hours and hours by the amazing pools. There is a nice, relatively affordable lunch spot right by the beach that has good food and good cocktails. We loved our stay here and would go back again!"

The bathroom has a seperate shower and tub. The floor to ceiling windows are very nice. Make sure to ask for a north facing view! It can't be beat! The casino is nice, but there aren't many things for kids to do, besides the shark thing and the pool. The pool area is very nice, but that's when the bad stuff begins. It is REALLY crowded at the pool. Think going to the beach on a sunny holiday/going to the park on Easter, and this is worse. Everything in the room looked worn. The gold on the faucets was coming off! They also have very few elevators. At one point, it took us TEN MINUTES to go down. The only reason we got in the elevator is because we decided to take one of the elevators that was going up and wait for it to go down. The front desk also should also have more workers checking people in. The lines were LONG. I ate at a pretty expensive Asian restaurant (forgot the name). The service there was good, but the food was bland and STALE. I've had $5 chinese lunch buffets that tasted fresher and had better flavor!!! Considering the pros/cons, I'd say this is a pretty average hotel. Too bad they don't charge average prices. This is one of the most expensive hotels on the strip. Since this is the case, I would suggest staying elsewhere."

The second room we were in was better, but lifting up the beadspread on the last day we found goldfish cracker crumbs and other unknown pieces of garbage. This hotel is NOT CLEAN! I think the problem with this hotel is that they are catering to the Bachelor/Bachelorette Party scene, and therefore, they're not making sure it's really clean and they are skimping on the service. I had stayed there 5 years ago, and it was much better. While I enjoyed my massage, overall the spa at Mandalay Bay is not very nice, especially compared with the Mirage, which I really liked. Stay somewhere else in Vegas. Sonoma, California"

We did experience some brown water early in the morning coming out of the sink but that was only once. I guess our biggest disappointment was how expensive everything was and the pool. Be careful if you do plan on staying there during the weekend, quite busy. We tried to get a fridge sent to our room, $20 plus tax per night. Frozen drinks at the pool $12 a pop. Also, get up bright and early in the morning to find a spot at the wave pool or lazy river area, packed like sardines. We ended up using the North Lagoon Pool, ask for its location, quiter pool and good drink service. We ate at Raffles Cafe twice, decent food. The House of Blues, great food. Border Grill, excellent apps and great bartenders. Overall, not a bad experience just on the expensive side."

The room we were assigned--a handicapped room, at our request (my husband uses a walker)--was fairly small and very plain. It also had no comfortable place to sit--only two straightback desk chairs. We asked if we could move to a regular room, and the response was immediate: We were upgraded to a large and lovely (if somewhat understated) two-bedroom suite with a sweeping view of the Strip. We had been in the room for about 20 minutes when the Front Desk called to see if we were satisfied with the change. We sure were! The only difference between the handicapped and non-handicapped bathroom was that there was a small 2\" lip on the shower enclosure, which didn't have a seat--no real problem for my husband. The service at the hotel was excellent: We requested a shower mat and bathrobes, and they were delivered within minutes. The housekeepers seemed to have a sixth sense about when we needed to have the room made up or the beds turned down: They were done promptly, with nice touches like fresh orchids on the pillows. Our only complaint was the crowded pool, but we got around it by going in the later afternnon (after 2 pm on a weekday). The high-end restaurants (Aureole, Shanghai Lily, etc.) were fabulous; just wish there were a few more affordable food choices.... All in all, we'd eagerly return to the Mandalay Bay."

I was offered adjoining rooms but made it clear to the desk clerk this was unacceptable. In response, the clerk retreated to the back office with my drivers license and took at least 10 minutes to return. When she did return, she simply thanked me for my patience but offered no remedy. Not wanting to cause a scene in front of my guests and having just endured a long car trip, I reluctantly accepted adjoining rooms instead of the suite I had booked and been charged a deposit for. The carpets were frayed and dirty, the bed sheets had a hole in them, the bath towels were grungy and the shower had been worn so slick that my husband and I both slipped. My husband proved more agile as he caught himself but I suffered an injury to my arm. Both the housekeeping carts and the housekeepers who pushed them were extremely loud. The carts squeaked and the housekeepers carried on endless chatter. Judging by the other comments, I'm certain the Mandalay Bay is beyond caring but I hope to save another unwary traveler from this horrible hotel. I've been a regular visitor to Las Vegas for well over thirty years - trust me when I say you would be wise to seek better accomodations. I think the Motel 6 would even be a wiser choice."

I am here with my wife for an entire week and everything has been excellent. In order, the checkin was quick and the person at the desk answered all our questions with a smile. The wait at the elevator has never been a problem. There are 2 banks of 8 depending on what floor you are on. I have lived in a high rise before, and trust me, it can be much worse. The room was clean, roomy, and the temp was just right. The bathroom is HUGE! I really liked the garden tub and marble shower. There was no fridge or coffee maker in the room, but I was told by a waitress that this is common. They don't want you eating leftovers! The pool was to die for. Wave pool, lazy river, and 2 other pools. There are waitresses bringing you drinks as you sun bath in the sand. There are cabanas that you can rent that have a fridge, changing area and even a plasma TV! I didn't opt for that level of luxury. The food is outstanding, but your going to pay for it. We opted to take the free monorail to Excalibur for the $14.99 Buffet vs. the $23.99 we paid the first night at the Mandalay Bay casino buffet. The spa prices were resonable and our room included a discount on them. (2 for 1) With the 2 for 1 we could both get a 25min massage for $75. My chiropractor charges $125/45 min for a physical therapy massage for comparison. Now for my comments on the strip. Buy your show tickets at a 1/2 price stand or at the box office to save the convience charge. I got 2 Celien Dion tickets for $87ea the night before the show from the box office. Hotel Recomendations: Don't stay at Harrah's. Full of Hard core smoking seniors. The place reaks of smoke. Just nasty. Tropicana can't even fix the escalators that go to the other resorts. So they flunk too. I talked to someone else who told me that the room halls in the Imperial Palace looked like you might get stabbed, and the elevators were nasty. Resorts we might stay at in order of preference: Wynn - New and very very nice. Venitian Bellagio Treasure Island Paris Cesars Palace New York MGM Grand Since there is a free monrail between these and Mandalay Bay and also a mall connecting them all, it's like one large property, so I also like: Luxor Excalibur But I did like being in the center of the strip better. Paris and Bellagio seem to be the heart of the best resorts. Best free show goes to Treasure Island. I'm told that the 10pm show is the best. (More Fireworks?) In conclusion. I think you will be happy with any of these hotels. If you can afford Mandalay Bay and want to spend time at the pool. Do it for sure."

The rooms desperately need to be updated, the beds are uncomfortable and the furniture is old and damaged. The bathroom was actually pretty nice with a large tub and seperate shower.

My main downers with the mandalay bay were -; slow waitress service, very bad maid service rooms wern't even made one day, way too crowded round the pool and finally very slow lifts.

The rooms are so big and clean all the time perfect floorplan and the beds are nice and soft. The bathroom is surprisingly large and allows 2-4 people to get ready without getting in the way of eachother. The pool and social areas were awsome as well. The wave pool was fun, they have certain time slots that the wave pool is more constant with waves, thank god for that. If those waves were big all day long nobody would hang out in it unless you brought your klids. You want big ocean waves go to cancun. The bars of corse are the best of the best. The rumjungle was crazy, if you like a layback bar go to the red room they have the best martinies. The loby as in all vegas hotels is well vented to prevent second hand smoke from bothering there non-smoking patrons. All in all vegas is awsome! The partys are the best! Mandaly is the best! And don't forget leave your kids at home or go elswhere; Also i read some reviews that were negative on mandalay bay beacuse of their lack of activities for kids. I say it's suposed to be that way kids don't belong in the casinos where sex, drugs and alcohol runs at a high level, what kind of parent would do that to there kids.

I was told it was not smoking but after going in the room and smelling smoke the front desk admitted it was a smoking room and that all rooms do have ashtrays. I must say it did not smell too bad of smoke but I felt decieved by the front desk. The room was large and fairly clean except for some carpet stains and a few hairs in the linens. The furnishing were very old and in need of updating. The comforter looked 10 years old and very worn. The whole place was crying for a remodelling. The beds were also very hard and worn out. The shower had an ugly shower curtain (I was in a handicap room so the curtain may only apply to the handicapped rooms) but they did have nice shampoo and conditioner products. The worst part of the stay was the pool area. There were no chairs to be found anywhere in the pool area. People were packed like sardines and leaning up against the walls as there was no place to sit. There is an adult area for topless sun bathers but there is a 50 dollar charge for men to enter. It seemed ridiculus to pay to use the pool at your own hotel. Last time we stayed at The Hotel at Mandalay bay. The Hotel is mondern with nice room furnishings and plasma tv's. I did enjoy our stay there however we were there in the winter and didn't need the pool. In the summer you still must share the overcrowded pool and I would probably avoid the place unless you like to stand by the pool. We ate at Aureole which was excellent but very expensive. I've stayed at Bellagio, Venetian, Paris, Caesars and MGM and would choose Mandalay Bay as the worst."

    "content": "April 2006 Member , Calgary, Alberta Just got back from Las Vegas. Booked into the Mandalay Bay Hotel after checking it out on the tripadvisor. Although it was rated to be above average hotel, we found that it was poorly managed and very inefficient in PR and poor co-ordination between management and guest. The check-in was a wash. There was no proper lines formed to ensure proper service to guest as the queue just form at each counter instead of a single queue that would ensure first come first serve. Registered guest could not ask a simple question (eg. where is the elevator?) without queuing behind a long line of new registering guest. Poor information on whereabouts of main locations i.e. elevators to the floors. Simple task like putting a floor plan at the registration area would help especially for 1st time guest. Poor layout of casino area that forces everyone to venture anywhere to pass through the smoke screen before they get anywhere. Children and non-smokers do not appreciate having second hand smoke! Poor coordination of information i.e. the pool times even among staff was not properly conveyed and limited pool usage time from 9.00a.m. to 6.00p.m. only. The wave pool is a joke with one wave every 5 minutes!! The rental of tube is $20.00. The gym is $30 per day use. I thought a 4 star hotel provide basis gym facilities!! Food is expensive despite being a casino. Guest were complaining to the staff and the staff did expressed their sympathy but could not help much except to direct the guest directly to the senior management which we did voice out our opinion. I do sympathize with the staff having to put up with the constant complains from the guest and also the second hand smoke that they have to endure all day and night. We requested a non-smoking room but was given a smoke filled room. The staff managed to change it for us. Although the rooms were large but unfortunately not very clean compared to smaller hotels. The elevators corridor was a zoo with all 3 wings converging in a central location serving 2 thousand rooms and guest trying to move their baggage up and down and guest trying to ride the elevators. We took the elevator up while going down to fight the rush to get into one. A couple of guest realise that it was faster to ride up and come down than wait for an elevator to go down. There are 3 hotels inside the Mandalay Bay hotel and this is very confusing to the 1st time guest especially for parking and getting around. A floor plan was handed out at check-in but the prints were tiny to know where to go. So it comes back to asking the front desk which involves waiting in line. We had a lunch and a dinner inside the hotel and found the prices more expensive than necessary considering that we could have better value elsewhere. We booked for 5 nights but checked out after 2 nights and headed for Palm Springs instead of enduring another 3 nights at a much higher room rate. One other guest in line also decided to check out despite having good reviews in her previous stays because she had to wait 45 minutes to get a simple answer from the front desk as people were cutting into her queue without realizing that she was waiting. Despite the huge income generated from the casino, I know that the hotel need to depend on continued satisfied guest that consider Las Vegas as a destination area and also a good value vacation spot. If it was just for the gambling, any casino without facility would do for gamblers. But if the Las Vegas hotels are to survive in the distant future, it should start to seriously consider the huge customer base that do not smoke and not necessary gamble big but spend considerable amount i.e. Disneyland, Universal Studios, Knotts Berry farm, even New York City etc. It is the consistent and larger group of people that are prepared to spend and enjoy what they value i.e. good food, fun and entertainment. After all the over-rated reviews of Las Vegas, my wife and daughter have decide never to go back as it was not a good experience for the money's worth. As for myself, I see the failings of these mega hotels in placing too much emphasis on being big and extravagant but forgetting that it is the efficiency, friendliness, thoughfulness, cleanliness, basis amenities, good value and enjoyable stay that makes a hotel. To proof my point, I know that hotels in New York City are very much smaller and rooms are tiny in comparison yet they are more appealing and yet more expensive in most of them. New York City may not have the gambling and vice appeal but it is still much more fun than Las Vegas with all the glitter and shine. For families planning to visit Las Vegas for family fun time, go any where else with a decent wave pool than Mandalay Bay."

Because it was a really hot day, the pool was heaving \u2013 it reminded us more of Butlins than a 4* hotel. The sun loungers were squeezed together like sardines and there was no service \u2013 again more queuing up to get a drink. We ate at Red White and Blue on our first night; nice food, very poor service. We went to The Caf\u00e9 for lunch and breakfast on our second day; great food and much better service. For our last night we ate at Mix in The Hotel. The view was amazing (we were lucky enough to get an outside table \u2013 ask for one of these if you are dining here and the weather is ok). The food and service was also fantastic. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d stay here again if we were to go back to Vegas. We\u2019d consider The Hotel as it has a more sophisticated atmosphere. However as it doesn\u2019t have it\u2019s own pool, we\u2019d be subjected to the horrors of the Mandalay Bay Beach, which I don\u2019t think we could put up with.

Trash everywhere, damp towels bundled by the hottub, filthy carpets, etc. That room was located on the 26th floor with a spectacular view of the strip. Upon calling down to the front desk to tell them of the problem, they offered us an \"upgraded\" room on \"a slightly lower\" floor. They moved us to the 3rd floor with a view of the airport. Eventually, they offered us $50 off the room for that evening. Next, we ate at Shanghai Lilly, the food was mediocre at best, and the staff charged us double for our bottle of wine. The next day, some relatives flew in to Vegas, and we moved into a room with them (as we had previously made reservations for weekend only, then added one night before). Upon their arrival, we again found that management checked us in to a dirty room- but this time, housekeeping got there just as we did. Throughout the visit, we repeatedly informed housekeeping that we had 4 adults staying in the room, and to please leave sufficient towels. Throught the visit, housekeeping left us with less than four of any type of towel. On Saturday afternoon, it took us over one HOUR to get through to housekeeping to get more towels. We arrived at the pool around 9:30 on Saturday, and we got the last four chairs at the pool area. Those who arrived later than we did had to sit on the hard concrete. To make matters worse, the hotel staff would only give out one towel at the pool area, so some people had to make do on the hard cement- needless to say, those visitors were less than pleased to spend so much on this resort to be treated as such. I understand that Easter weekend is a busy weekend, but for a resort this size, they should be able to accomodate their guests! Plus, this resort is so far away from the heart of the strip, it was a hassle to leave the area and have the Vegas experience. The ONLY nice thing that I have to say about this resort is that they freely hand out drinks in the casino- even if you aren't in the big spending areas."

Top rate hotel in terms of false promises. All about booking you and taking your cash. We were bumped the first night to the fours season section of the hotel (much nicer) and promised that the night would be \"comped\" because the hotel was oversold and they did not have a room for us. We were promised a \"suite\" upon our return to Mandalay Bay portion the next day and were to be walked over from the four seasons. Instead we carried our own luggage over only to be delivered into a disgustingly dirty room on the 4th level with a tiny window. Garbage and hair everywhere. When we complained to management they said there was nothing else available and politely asked if there was anything they could do to make our stay better? I replied a clean room. To top it off Four Seasons and Manadalay Bay both charged our visa twice for the first nights stay, even though we paid for the first night upon booking. So they charged through 3 charges for 2 sets of rooms. On the last day we rode down with some guests who reported the same experience about the ratty rooms. Dirty carpet and beds. Save yourself the trouble and money. Anywhere has better service and cleaner rooms."

It took two to three complaints before it was cleaned properly. We were moved to another room, which was equally dirty (would not like to walk barefoot on the carpets), however could not fault reception staff. They were most professional and apologetic over this complaint. Hotel spa manicure was hurried and incomplete, again reception staff were professional and courteous. Shark reef was worth the visit, as was Mandalay Place shopping. The restaurant, RM seafood well worth a visit, as was the Burger Bar and House of Blues. I would highly recommend a helicopter trip to The Grand Canyon. We flew with Papillon. Spectacular is an understatement. On the strip, visit Smith and Wolinski restaurant. Bit pricey, but what a T-bone steak. Visit the Pharoe restaurant in the Luxor for the buffet breakfast, well worth the cost."

We stayed here when they first opened and at that time chose it for the pools and the wave pool was closed that time. Not having good luck in that dept. Booked the rooms several months before and checked the rates a little closer to when we ould be there and they were much lower ($100/room/night). Called and they adjusted the rate. Checked in at 9pm and asked for connecting rooms. She said they only had them on a smoking floor - no way. She said they had adjoining rooms on a non-smoking floor. We got up there and our rooms reeked of smoke and there was an ashtray and matches and the rooms were across the hall frome each other. I called the front desk and he tried to tell me ALL the rooms have ashtrays (now why would a non-smoking room have an ashtray?). I said I couldn't stay in that room. (The carpet was pretty filthy too). He said they had 2 non-smoking rooms on a penthouse floor but on different wings. He said the rooms were the same \"but a little nicer.\" All I cared about was that they didn't reek of smoke. The rooms were the same, but I think they had upgraded amenities, and we got turn down service one night in one room. The carpet was cleaner (maybe that was how it was nicer?). But wonder of wonders - there was no ashtray! The rooms are nice, the bathrooms are nice. The bed was probably one of the hardest I have ever slept on though. It was torture, and I rarely complain about hotel beds. One good thing about being on a penthouse floor is you have your own elevators for those 3 floors, so there was never any waiting. Every staff member with the exception of one valet was very friendly and helpful. We ate breakfast in Raffles Cafe and the service was fine, but nothing outstanding. We ate dinner at the Burger Bar - very good burgers and Fleur de Lys. My husband thought Fleur de Lys was one of the best meals he'd ever had, the service was great, but my meal was good - not great (and not worth $300 that we paid for the 2 of us). Overall it was a good experience, but I sure wish I could stay at a time when all the pools were open (and both times they opened the day I left)."

ALWAYS visit the casino host (located next to the cashier cage) and see if your play rates a discount on your bill. Hope this helps- looking forward to a better trip next year. Peace"

There is a Starbuck's if you like to wait in a constant line for nasty coffee. Also the employee's were rude and acted like the customer's were a bother. Two of the restaurants were closed and all the others had a constant line of about 20 minutes to over an hour.

The bathroom was very nice, with a large tub and a separate marble shower. My room had a view looking at the Luxor, and on up the strip, so can't complain there. There were only a couple of things that keep me from saying it was a great experience. For some reason, whenever my neighbor on the next floor up used their bathroom, it caused the drains in my bathroom to make gurgling noises for a few seconds. Ordinarily not a big deal, but a little annoying to wake up to in the middle of the night. The only other negative only became an issue the last night there. The wind had kicked up outside because of an approaching weather system. The wall-to wall windows in the room had a little bar that could be shifted up to allow fresh air. These blew open while I was out. When I got to my door, I could hear wind howling around it. The fresh air bars would not stay closed, and whined like a jet engine. I ended up rolling up a bedspread and blocking the vents, and putting a rolled up towel in front of my room's door, in order to stop the cross-draft and quiet the wind noise down. Not a bad hotel, but for over $200 a night, not perfect either. You could certainly stay in worse places in Vegas, but you could probably stay in better too."

We ended up going to the Monte Carlo where we had a lot more fun with newer games. THe spa is GREAT, and we are going to to be coming back. A little pricey, but with a good promo (10% off a package deal), we spend an entire day there. The room was good, and I guess we were fortunate. A mentioned drawback is that as soon as you step in through the doors, you're kinda on your own navigating around the place. The staff don't even seem to know where things are, and gave poor directions. The restaurants are pretty good, except for Red/White/Blue. My friend ordered breakfast there (French Toast for $15!) and discovered moldy raspberries. We complained, and no manager came out to talk to us (although we DID see the chef chew out the kitchen staff), and when we insisted on talking to the manager, he didn't take any rsponsibility or initiative, and started to lamely make excuses that another manager was handling it should have talked to us - he was doing us a favor. LAME customer service. Comped our meal, but that was not the point. We complained to the hotel management, but apparently, all the restaurants in the Mandalay are independently run...they are Mandalay tenants. So that was a downer. Our promo deal (10% discount on spa, $100 meal voucher, $99 rate) made it worthwhile. Otherwise, not too great."

Bathroom walls had what appeared to be (very noticeable) blood stains. Housekeeping did not change TP, nor did they provide washcloths. Went to grab a late night snack at restaurant, waited forvever to get served. There are some serious labor issues at this hotel, which may be a result of the booming Vegas economy. Elevators and hallways are beginning to get ratty. Elevators almost got stuck a few times (door closes, but it does not move). Paid $7 for coffee and muffin.

The staff was very friendly and very professional. I felt comfortable being in a new place and not knowing what to expect. The hotel was fine. I enjoyed it. My only complaint was that there wasn't a bell-boy availbale to help us with our luggage when we arrived. Our view of the strip overlooked the airport instead. The beds were very comfortable. I loved the huge bathtub and the bathroom was very big with plenty of room. The rooms are bigger in this hotel that they are at the Monte Carlo. The staff did a very nice job cleaning. The lotions and ammenities were also very nice there. I highly recommend a day at the spa though, to anyone who can go. Even if you can only afford a little time in the hot tub or steam room...WELL worth the money to be able to relax for awhile. A trip I wont ever forget!!!!!!!!!!!

I found the staff at the Mandalay Bay (in fact, the whole experience) very substandard and down right horrible. These are strong words, but it has been a long time since I have seen such poor service from hotel staff. Must less, from a hotel that boasts a AAA 4 Diamond award. Someone must have been paid off or AAA has lowered their standards significantly. From the Doormen that expect tips and do nothing, but actually don't do anything except surf on bell carts and talk about their plans for the weekend, to the Bellman that walks in, places the bag on the floor (doesn't orient the room, tell you how to use anything, recommend resturants, etc. but still took my $10 for my one bag. It almost seems that these guys expect gratuities so service is not the name of the game. The front desk was agent seemed to be the only positive individual we came across during our stay. The FandB staff at the Bar was some of the worst I have seen. After an altercation with one of the bartenders (believe it) they only offered to move us to another bar (however, the young lady that was the assistant beverage manager was very nice, but most likely makes half of what these guys make, so probably doesn't really care). Change was asked for and it seemed to be interupting the bartender's conversation about last nights fun with the bar back. The guy got down right angry when we called him out on not wanting to make change in a timely manner. Once again, must have expected a tip. The old saying, build it and they will come is what comes to mind because the place was packed. Why do they care about service if they are getting your $300 per night and the place is sold out. Someone needs to go in and wake up the manager of this hotel, because apparently they are asleep at the wheel. You'll be sorry! I have 10plus years in the luxury hotel business and I am not making this up! Oh, and by the way, you pay for everything! I'm not cheap, but why should I have to pay $11.99 per day for internet when it's free at a $120 per night Marriott Courtyard? Doesn't make sense. The sad reality, we spent 90% of our visit accross the street at the Tropicana. A much less expensive hotel, but the staff was wonderful (dealers, bartenders and the door staff) were all great. Old Vegas style with customer service in mind."

Had to wait almost 12 hours, 3 calls to front desk to get that sorted out. They comp the room, so I forgave them for that one. Housekeeping - Threw away my brand new cleanser when they cleaned the room. Extremely upset but did not pursue the matter Security - I had extended my stay and inform front desk upon check in that I was staying longer than I booked for. They apparently reassigned my room out on the day I was supposed to originally check out. I just stepped out of the shower and someone opened my door. When i confronted the reception, they claimed that I had already checked out and housekeeping did a physical check of the room. However, my luggage was all unpacked on the beds and housekeeping did not even clean my room that day! Made a report to security, unsymapthetic. Duty manager insisted that I decide whether I wanted to stay on or to check out. And even had security escort me back to my room to pack and escort me out of the hotel! They made me seem like I was the one in the wrong!!! This was Xmas Eve, I had no where to go but wasn't going to stay and pay them for another night! ANYONE WHO WANTS TO STAY AT MANDALAY, BEWARE.... SERVICE STAFF ARE BAD AND THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU AS A CUSTOMER AT ALL! The Front office manager was suppose to contact me to follow up after Xmas, they never did and they still have the cheek to email me promos about the hotel every now and then!"

Upon arrival, we weren't impressed that there were no doormen to greet or help with luggage and the front desk people had attitude, and were in a huge hurry. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was nice, I'll give it that. But the bedding, linens, & decor were Holiday Inn quality. Plus - no ironing board or iron in the room - no robes - and housekeeping wouldn't give us anymore shampoo/conditioner. It was just odd. We had a lovely view of the airport as well. It just wasn't the place to stay if you're looking for luxury - I would definitely recommend THEHotel wing of Mandalay Bay as opposed to the actual resort/casino part. Or, better yet, stay at the Bellagio!"

    "content": "My husband and I stayed 3 nights at Mandalay bay in October for a trade show. We had heard so much hype about the hotel that we were really looking forward to our trip. At first glance, the room was fantastic - huge, with a huge, lovely bath. However, there is a phone next to the toilet, but the phone was hanging off the wall by a wire. We reported it to housekeeping. Their first fix was to pull it off the wall and put it on the tank. Then they installed a new phone, leaving the old one. The old one finally disappeared on day 3. Wierd. When we first checked in I had to use the toilet immediately (long wait for a cab)and found it FILTHY. Unflushed, long, black hairs on the seat, urine on the bowl just behind the seat. I had to leave to my meeting so my husband called housekeeping, twice. Finally two housekeepers showed up. One berated the other the whole time. After they left it turned out they had cleaned everything but the toilet! The ironing board had a 5 inch stain that looked like dried blood. I had to put a towel on it to iron my white dress. The closet light was burned out. The safe malfunctioned and my husband had to wait hours for maintenance to come get his money out. The second day half the pool area was closed so there were no free chairs. I sat on the concrete. The innertubes for the river were $30! We didn't bother. We had a special dinner at Aureole for my birthday. The bread was freezing cold, flatware was dirty and I ended up with food poisoning. Fun birthday! Thankfully we spent only $119 per night. (the group special rate for our event was $250!) For being so far at the end of the strip we wouldn't return. We usually stay at the Flamingo and will go back there."

I mean, it's not a bad hotel...but it's large and impersonal...and the food leaves much to be desired. I still don't have a favorite hotel in Vegas. The Westin is very nice...but the pool is pretty basic. Overall, I guess my current first choice is the Westin...but I'm still exploring other Las Vegas hotel choices."

We goto Vegas a lot and my wife said it was the most comfortable bed she's had at a hotel. Price wise it was 1/2 the price of the Wynn. The spa was nice also. It isn't as big as Spa Mandalay but it was pretty empty in there so it's like having the whole place to yourself. I recommend anyone going to Vegas during the cold season to stay on this side. Makes you not want to leave the room. Although I would still prefer to stay at the Mandalay Bay side during the summer as you're down at the beach and not in the room. We got 1/2 price at spa and $50 food credit so that was an added bonus."

They had thre plasma TV's, one in the bathroom infront of the huge tub. The bathroom was almost bigger than my room, with separate shower and tub, 2 sinks, and a big mirror,(very nice sence my mom and I need to use it at the same time). I was on a very high floor and had a nice view of the whole strip. I haft to say the service was pretty good, I needed another pillow and more towels for the bathroom one night and someone came with both things probably not even longer then 10 minutes. The pool area was also very very nice, I've also been to Hawii and the pool area made me feel like I was there again. It has a wave pool with even real sand around it, a lazy river, and 5 differant pools to chose from. One was even heated which was nice. There even is a shark reef nere the hotel, if you like water life you will love this. One thing in my opinion that you can't miss! Overall a very nice place to stay. Some of my friends that stayed at other hotels visited THEhotel and wished that they would of stayed there because they also thought that it was a very nice place. I will definitly go there again if I have the money!!"

The first night we were in an \"executive suite\". But it was on the 4th floor. They call it a \"strip view\". Whatever...the room was very nice though. After 3 nights on a horrible mattress, one complaint to the front desk relocated us to the 30th floor. To be honest, at this point we didn't care about a view.just a good nights rest. Boy did we score! Great bed & superb view. The room # was 30233. Large suite with sofa, small firdge etc. GREAT 2 person jacuzzi tub! Here were the drawbacks. 1) Mandalay Bay is a VERY noisy hotel. (Thank goodness I brought my earplugs). In the hallways, the floor is tiled then carpeted,tiles, then carpet. So when they come to clean you hear bump, ga bump.over & over.This began at 8:30 one morning. #2)Housekeeping knocks on your door, yells \"Housekeeping\" and before you could even make it 1/2 way there they open the door and start to come in. My suggestion is to lock the door.Also, make sure you put the privacy sign out. This also happened with staff who are in charge of the bottled water. They knock, then come right in!The first time this happened I had jsut gotten out of a soak in the tub , thank goodness I put a robe on and was goig thru a drawer to get p.j.'s & in they came. Glad I was dressed! Bottom line: We would go there again. Price was $149 for a beautiful suite plus a $35.00 dining credit and many other perks/coupons. The overall ambience of the hotel is fantastic. Best steaks were pricey/competitve and found at the 3950 restuarant. The meals were 5 star!"

Mandalay Spa Nightmare I booked a female massuese and got a male who during the massage complained about having to work on the holidays between nodding off. I had to keep speaking or clearing my throat to keep him awake. He was so unprofessional! It was the worst massage I have ever recieved! I left the Spa stressed out and I paid for relaxation. We were glad to check out... and THEN IT GOT BAD!! Upon recieving my Bank Statement I noticed that Mandalay Bay had mistakenly charged my account $580 in Spa Charges. When I called to complain about the service and charges, the manager on staff glossed over the bad service and wasn't very surprised about the \"glitch in the system\". Apparently this has happened before. Upon recieving my Credit Card Statement I noticed that Mandalay Bay had not credited my card for the first night stay as I had requested. So we ended up paying an extra night on two different Credit Cards... BRILLIANT! If you really want \"four star treatment\", relaxation and don't want to be \"accidentally robbed\" don't do Mandalay Bay, stay at Caeser's Palace."

We were told no other cabanas were available. We ordered eight beers, and a couple of tropical drinks and were billed $75, plus $250 for the cabana (they would't honor my \"quote\" of $200). After 2 hours we left, disgusted. The sun never came near our cabana - it was completely hidden by trees. A very dissappointing waste of $325. I've loved the cabanas at the Wynn, Bellagio, and NYNY, and since Mandalay Bay has the best beach, I assumed the cabanas would be worth the money. They were not. Stay Away..."

The room had lighted his & hers closets. It was clean, quiet, in good repair, and the bed was firm but comfortable. The room had its own thermostat and I was able to get a good temperature. The bathroom was large, with a tub (with bath salts) and a separate shower stall. It had a long counter with his & hers sinks and a lighted magnifying mirror and a small separate stall for the toilet. One minor annoyance was a slow drain in one of the sinks, but since there was another one, it didn't matter to me. The meeting rooms are a real hike from the rooms - literally about a quarter mile. No ducking back to the room during breaks! The hotel is at one end of the strip. There's a tram to the Luxor and Excaliber, but it's a hike to the other casinos. I didn't gamble much, but the odds didn't look that good from what I saw - 6 for 5 on blackjack (not 3 for 2) and 1-2-3-4-5-7 on video poker (not 1-2-3-4-5-8). Lower limits were on the high side.

There was no turndown service at all - I expect that at a 4-star hotel. I get it at less expansive hotels. Also we paid extra to have 3 in our room but housekeeping did not service the room for 3 people. We complained and quickly received a credit. (Thanks Chris, you are the only good thing abot Mandalay!) Our so-called No Smoking room had an ashtray in it and it was obvious prior occupants had smoked there. Also we could smell smoke coming in through the vents. Mandalay said they HAVE to put ash trays in every room, and they don't mark floors as \"no smoking\" because they don't want too much signage in the hotel. What a stupid policy!! Overall we were extremely disappointed and wish we had stayed elsewhere. This pool is very nice but crowded - people are stacked on top of each other and smokers are everywhere. The only good things at Mandalay were the restaurants. Red Square has AMAZING food (chicken kiev, osso bucco and stroganoff were terrific), don't let the Russian theme scare you. MIX atop THE Hotel has impeccable service and outstanding food. It's pricey but worth it if service and views are important to you. If you go, try to get a table outside.

My husband expressed our dissatisfaction the next morning and we were moved to a room on the 32nd floor with a view of the strip. We were told our new room would be ready ASAP and they would call us when it was ready. They never called and we had to check back with the desk 3 times before it was finally ready. The view was certainly better but the room was still lacking. Stained and frayed carpeting and again mold in the bathroom. Not all the amenities that were in our first room were in our second room (e.g. q-tips, sewing kit). We also found that out of a bank of 12 elevators only 1 or 2 seemed to be running so the wait was lengthy and very crowded as people were squeezing on to avoid further wait time. The Shark Reef was a nice exhibit albeit not worth the $16 per person for the 10 minute walk through. Our dining experience at 3950 was pleasant and the food was good. Good food and service at the House of Blues and good service from the bartender in the sports bar. This was an okay hotel, in my opinion, but certainly not worthy of their 4 star status. We hold a family reunion in Vegas annually and I can guarantee will we NOT be returning to Mandalay Bay next year."

    "content": "This past summer was my sixth stay at Mandalay Bay. I've always enjoyed it in the past and this visit was no exception. There were only a couple of negative things, which I'll get out of the way first: the carpets in the guest rooms are starting to show their age in some cases and need to be replaced. Also, the elevators were a little slow at times, even with two banks that each serve a separate group of floors. Now for the good: the casino is still in great shape and very airy and well-designed, as well as a bit less confusing and maze-like than most Strip behemoths. The restaurant selection is terrific, with a full selection of menu types, so long as you're not looking to go cheap all the time. The recent addition of Fleur de Lys gives diners another Continental option in a more romantic setting than the ultra-modern Aureole. The pool area remains the best in town, if you can get a lounge chair. There are plenty of nooks and crannies to look in, though, and the cocktail service at the pool is fine. Went to the spa for the first time this visit, and found the decor to be the most pleasing of any I've been in in Vegas. Very exotic with a nice menu of services--and the plunge pool communal area is like a sultan's oasis in some lost jungle. VERY nice. Nightlife is also tops here--there's great bar-hopping to be done by starting at Red Square for a specialty martini, then going next door to rumjungle for a tropical concoction, then heading up the elevator to the bar at Mix in THEhotel for whatever else you want, plus a knockout view of the Strip. And if you're not falling-down drunk yet, there's also a wine bar at Aureole and the bar at House of Blues. There are also lots of neat shops in Mandalay Place--and not all of them require bank loans, like the shopping areas at the Venetian or Bellagio. The rooms [aside from the aforementioned carpets] are well-designed, comfortable, romantic and large. The bathrooms are especially glorious, with acres of marble, deep soaking tubs and separate showers. There are also several entertainment venues, from the Events Center to the House of Blues to the sit-down production of \"Mamma Mia\", to concert events on the stage at the pool. I've read some of the complaints about service on this site, but all I can say to that is every staff member I've encountered in my many stays has been pleasant and efficient. Tip: Ask for a room on the 17th floor. This is where the elevator banks split, and you won't have to wait for anyone to get off on floors 1-16 on your way up or stop for them to get on on your way down."

I arrived on a Monday evening so no queues at checkout and stayed until Saturday morning. There were never any queues for the lifts, I was on floor 8. There was a view of the mountains and the pools which I loved. The pool area was brilliant although when I arrived mid afternoon a lot of the beds were taken but I found empty ones near one of the smaller pools. I didn't bother hiring a ring as you could easily float around the lazy river. I only used a taxi once when going to the Riviera for La Cage. Otherwise I took the express tram to Excalibur (the one that stops at Luxor means you have to walk right through the Excalibur) and then crossed to MGM if I wanted to get the Strip monorail. The shuttle also stops at Mandalay Bay and takes time but you get to see the Strip. Went to some of the bars in the hotel - good service at all. Also went to the Red Square restaurant where the food was excellent and very attentive service. The buffet was good as well, cheaper than the Aladdin which I also visited. Checkout was easy and the bellboys came within 5 minutes of calling. I would definitely stay there again."

Check in was a breeze. The design of this hotel makes it easy to find your way around the complex. We've stayed at other properties in Las Vegas and we felt this is the easiest to find your way around. The room was immaculate. Nice decor. The bathroom was huge along with great complimentary toiletries. The only problem we had in our room (16-131) was the lack of water pressure in the shower. We never called to complain about it, as we didn't feel it was a big deal. Afer reading some of the reviews it doesn't seem to happen often, it might have just been that room. Everytime we go to Las Vegas we stay at different properties just to try them out. But we've agreed that we will always stay at Mandalay Bay. Don't let the location turn you off (it's a the south end of the strip), it's very easy to get to Luxor & Excalibur via the free tram. Once you get to the Excalibur you're just a hop, skip, and a jump away from New York, New York, MGM Grand, and the Tropicana."

    "content": "Just returned from 3 nights Oct. 7-10. Bottomline was that we enjoyed the avg. age mid-40's and less crowd at this hotel, as it seemed to have the perfect vibe for us (both in our 30's). My wife enjoyed being at the south end of the strip away from the crowds infesting the Bellagio/Venetian/Ceasars. The pool was very tropical. The restaurants/bars/lounges were perfect. The gaming wasn't too busy, and while the wheel of fortune slots were like a bad addiction to my wife, the Blackjack table paid me back and more (comped on our poolside drinks and some food ($75) and offered 2 future nights stay). We arrived at 11:30pm, and asked for a strip-view room. I was worried from other reviews that we would not be accommodated. The clerk explained that at the late hour of our check-in that for our 1st night she would not be able to help us, but that we would be moved the next day for the remainder of our trip. This was a bit of a letdown, but IMO to be expected due to an 11:30pm check-in on a Friday night. In fact, once we were in our 4th floor 2xdouble bed room with no view (same gorgeous bathroom), I realized that this is where most people checking in at that hour/day were being sent. To us it became a minor problem, when after a night spent mostly at the casino/bars, and the day spent mostly at the pool, we called down to the desk and arranged for a bell person to come up with our new keys to our strip-view room on the 28th floor. The floor-to-ceiling windows made for a view I couldn't believe, straight north up Las Vegas Blvd (#28-234)! We didn't ever close our drapes. We have an easy going attitude and loved this hotel. Don't believe all the complainers giving this hotel a bad rating. The elevators were never a problem, the taxi's were always available w/o a wait, there is a free monorail up to the Excalibur from which you can walk to a tram at the MGM. We just walked from there north to Flamingo intersection. Who are these people complaining about walking? Always something to look at, and I just don't mean the hotels! We rented a car for our last 2 days (Dollar rent-a-car in the hotel), went to Red Rock Canyon (drive south to Blue Diamond #160, head west to 159) stopping at the \"Stake-Out\" bar, off Tropicana in a strip mall, to watch a Buffalo Bills game (funny). The Canyon was very beautiful and a quick and easy escape (25mins one-way) for those that want to see some of the Southwest's landscape w/o going all the way to the Grand Canyon. The next day, we also used the car to store our bags, as we had obtained a (late) 1:00pm check-out, but didn't fly out until 11:30pm. It worked perfectly. We valet parked at Bally's and walked around all day, until our reservation @ Roy's (Flamingo and Paradise). After dinner drove south on Paradise, got gas, stopped at Hard Rock for some last drinks/slots and then dropped the car at the airport. Highly recommend (all must do's) Mandalay Bay strip-view room, Red Rock Canyon, Mon Ami Gabi for lunch on patio (mussels and frites), Sushi Roku (Ceasars) for cool vibe sushi experience (Yellow-tail sushi app. and ahi sashimi), Blue cheese stuffed-olive Martinis at Red Square (wow), dinner at Roy's (seared ahi tuna and lobster pot-stickers apps.), drinks at Tao (Venetian) and Rum-Jungle (Mandalay Bay). Stop into the Carnival Court Bar, outside @ Harrah's for a beer (you'll see). We didn't even hit a buffet! My wife want's to go back already, and so do I."

The marble bathroom is large with shower and a deep soaking tub. Restaurants - They were pricey but very good. All fine dining restaurants in Las Vegas are very expensive no matter where they are. We also enjoyed the buffet for breakfast one day. Housekeeping -They did a great job - room was always cleaned when we were out and about. We never came back to an unmade room. Pools - Beautiful! We never had a problem getting a chair. We checked out about fifteen different hotels while in Las Vegas and liked Mandalay Bay the best. It seemed less crowded and frantic than some of the other hotels (Maybe because of its location at the end of the strip). It seemed cleaner and fresher than a lot of the hotels also. Some of the older places just reek of smoke. All in all we had a great experience and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel."

The rooms were fantastic with cool floor to ceiling windows reveiling a wonderful view of the strip and the mountains. The rooms were so clean also, the maids always came at convenient times and did a superb job. Looking round the other hotels in the same league as Mandalay, did not even compare to it. Paris was to busy and crowded. Venetian was nice inside but had a funny disinfectant smell to it and annpoying sirens went off every other minute which you could hear outside! Aladdin looked good and the shops there were great but still doesnt have the feel of the luxurios Mandalay Bay. The pools there were fantastic i spent so long in the wavepool. We found a nice smaller but much quiter pool which was further to walk but so quiet and could always get a sunbed in the sun or the shade, plus there is a bar next to it! Overall it was an amazing stay and would definately go again. I would reccommend this hotel to anyone seeking a fun holiday. DON'T listen to those bad mouthing this hotel, they must be crazy, trust me its awesome there!"

The buffet at Mandalay was excellent. All eight of us ate there twice during our four day stay. -Transport. The monorail to Luxor and Excallibur was easy to get to and fast. Within ten minutes you are in MGM or NY NY. I usually don't make an effort to write a review, but I felt obligated considring how off the mark some of the critical reviews were.

They allowed us to check in early so we didn't end up getting the non-smoking room we requested. But we felt this was fine because we wanted to get out and explore the Strip and all the casinos asap and didn't want to wait around for our non-smoking room to be prepared. We should have waited. The smoking room had a definite stale smell to it, there was leftover garbage (used matchsticks, dust, dirt and a broken fake diamond bracelet) at the lower corner of our bed. I guess they forgot to sweep the dirt into the garbage pail before they left the room. There was also a scrub brush on the floor in front of the window that was never picked up. On top of that, when we brushed our teeth that night, we discovered the sinks backed up. The next day we complained and Mandalay changed our room by 5pm that evening to a non-smoking room, one floor lower than our original room. The room smelled fresh, it was clean, the sinks worked properly and it was a bit larger than the last room. Always worth it to speak up if you are not happy with what they provide you. You could spend a week at Mandalay and never leave. The pool, casino, restaurants, shopping, shark reef and clubs could keep you busy all week. However, we ventured out exploring every day, so the Mandalay wasn't very convenient for this as it was at the Southern most part of the Strip. We had to take the tram to Excalibur and then walk over to the MGM Grand to take the next tram to other hotels/casinos around the Strip. We got quite the workout during the 4 days we were there. Would I stay at Mandalay again? Yes, if I could just hang out by the pool and go to the spa; No if I wanted to eat at and see shows at different casinos/hotels. I wouldn't want to walk that much again if I go back to Vegas."

    "content": "This was my fourth trip to Vegas in 4 years. My wife and I have previously enjoyed our stays at other casino/resorts very much - especially Caesars. We like to try new things, so we always stay somewhere different. This time, we were deciding between the Venetian and Mandalay - we decided on Mandalay because the pool seemed beautiful and our aunt recommended it. Overall, there was nothing horrible about the hotel, but it just came very short of our expectations. We were expecting the resort experience - this is what we wanted - to spend time at the spa, sit by the pool and drink margaritas, work out in the fitness center, enjoy a nice room - but Mandalay fell short on all counts. On arrival, we went to book some spa treatments. They were all booked for the weekend - just one opening at 8:30 a.m. - who wants a massage then? And - men must be massaged by men, women by women - not sure about how I feel about this one. You can book your massage 45 days in advance - so if you are planning that far ahead (we don't) then you should book when you reserve the room. Now - with a spa treatment, you can use the fitness center free all day - but, with no spa treatment - its $27. That's too much for 30min on the treadmill for me. Way too much. Off to the pool. We were up late in the casino - got to the pool around noon - nowhere to sit. The place was packed. Finally we found an empty place, but no chairs to sit on. Pool service was not helpful to find a chair. Eventually after 30 minutes of circling the pool area I found two unused chairs. The second day we didn't even bother - it was too exhausting the first time. Pool service will happily bring you an $11 margarita - but forget it for food. Get that yourself. Want an inflatable tube for the lazy river - gotta pay for that too - and without it the lazy river isn't so lazy. Our room: it was bigger than your average NYC or LA room. Nice bathroom - 2 sinks, lots of marble. BUT - I asked for 3 things: 1) high room, 2) strip view, 3) a king size bed. We were short on all. Low room (on the 7th floor with some kind of obstructive decoration in front of the window), facing away from the strip - and 2 double beds instead of a king. That will really spruce up our weekend away from the kids. Any of these issues alone would have been forgivable, but all together it put a real sour note on our stay. We did not enjoy the Mandalay Bay and would not recommend it. Other hotel/casino/resorts on the strip seem more attentive - as soon as you walk in to the Venetian, the Wynn, the Alladin - people are guiding you around, welcoming you, etc. The Mandalay seemed to not cope with all the customers. Too bad - it is a beautiful looking place. On a positive note, I did complain and my feedback was well received. As a compensation they knocked about $100 off my bill. But it was still over $700 for 3 nights - way too much considering we didn't enjoy any of the facilities. We had one meal at the \"Cafe\" restaurant. Not bad fajitas."

    "content": "We stayed at Mandalay Bay Sept 5-7, just after Labor Day weekend. My husband and I were excited about our trip but also a little worried about some of the negative comments we had been reading about the hotel. Luckily, we were thrilled with our experience and hope to go back soon. First, we highly recommend going mid-week for smaller crowds and lower rates. When we called to confirm our reservation the week before, we were told our rate had gone down!!! We checked in 2 hours early on Labor Day as everyone was leaving and waited 15 minutes at most to do so. We upgraded to a Honeymoon suite, which just added back on the rate reduction we had been told about before we got there. By getting a suite you get access to the House of Blues Foundation Room, which is a restaurant and later turns into a nightclub, on the top floor. Since we don't normally have access to things like that, we decided to have dinner there our first night. It was outstanding, probably the best steak I've ever had. We ate at N9NE at the Palms the 2nd night and it didn't come close to our experience at the Foundation Room. Our room was very large and we had a view of the mountains, not such a bad thing. Sunsets were beautiful to see from the room. The bathrooms are what I expected after reading so many reviews, huge and luxurious. The bathtub is great, especially when you use all the bath salts and products they leave for you. Our room was on the 31st floor. We didn't have any abnormally long wait times for elevators Our other dining experiences in the hotel were average, nothing that stood out, good or bad, and nothing too overly expensive. Breakfast at the coffee stand on the beach level is a quick and relatively inexpensive option. We had lunch one day at Raffles and were pleased with what we had. We didn't have to wait anywhere we went, so that was nice. The pools are definitely impressive. We walked around the pools and beach a little but decided to pay $50 a day to spend our 2 days at the Moorea Beach club, and it was worth every penny. We were away from our kids and determined to have a great time, so we treated ourselves with new experiences. It's $10 for women and $40 for men on weekdays, higher on weekends. They give you a bracelet and you can come and go all day. They seat you when you come in and get your chairs all set up for you. Not everyone goes topless but a large percentage did while we were there. The food and drinks are expensive in the beach club, we left to eat in the hotel instead. Excellent sound system, no kids, several pools, misters, cabanas, reserved seating, etc. - it was a great experience and one we'll opt for next time too. We bought some inner tubes at one of the nearby drugstores for $3 a piece so that we could do the lazy river, however it was closed for some reason while we were there. We didn't try the wave pool either but watched from the beach club, it looked like a lot of fun. After reading several suggestions, we decided to book spa treatments for our check-out day. However, once you check-out of the hotel and go to the spa, they don't really want you to leave and keep one of their lockers occupied. You can come and go as you please, so it might be better to not even say anything about just checking out and spending the day there. We wanted more time at the pool before we needed to get ready for our flight at 7pm and talked them into letting us keep our things in the lockers in between our spa treatments and coming back to get ready. The spa is incredible, lots of amenities, snacks, drinks, everything you need to get ready for your flight or whatever you're doing (except make-up). We thought it might also be a problem to get back to the pools after checking out of our room because you need your room key to get in, but if you go to the beach club in the morning and get a bracelet for the day, that's all you need to get back in there. The hotel is definitely located at the end of the strip, just like everyone writes in their reviews. We used the shuttle to Excalibur a lot. However, one night we walked all the way down to Wynn, just meandering in and out of the hotels and shops along the way. At 1am (at Wynn) we decided we probably ought to get back to Mandalay Bay, so we walked briskly all the way back - took about 45 minutes. We didn't really notice any deficits in service or attitude of the people working at the hotel, everyone was nice and helpful. Service in the Foundation Room is top notch. All in all, we had a fabulous time at Mandalay Bay and would book a stay there again in a heartbeat."

    "content": "Negative people always seem to find a way to be negative. I felt slightly wary booking a stay at Mandalay after reading several negative reviews. My husband and I just had an excellent experience at this hotel mid-week. The front desk staff was very busy, but very adept at checking people in quickly. They accommodated our advance request for a king size bed in a non-smoking room with a strip view and even upgraded us to an \"executive suite\" at no extra cost! There was a 10,000 person convention at Mandalay during our stay and we never had to wait more than a minute for an elevator. The hallways were quiet. The suite was excellent, very roomy, clean, and of course the Mandalay bathrooms are legendary...huge, with a deep jacuzzi tub, separate glassed-in shower and separate toilet room. Excellent thick towels and lovely toiletries. So what if there's a stain on a chair or the bed spread is a little scratchy? Don't demand perfection in Vegas. Every single staff member that we encountered at this hotel was friendly: front desk, information desk, slots club, waitstaff, housekeeping. The restaurant choices are colorful and fabulous. We ate at the buffet every morning for breakfast - it was reasonable, convenient, and the food choices were excellent. The pool area is great; the wave pool and lazy river are a lot of fun. (FYI: if you are comfortable floating on your back, don't bother with the $20 tube rental.) And believe me, having to show your room key to get in is a benefit, not something to complain about, as some former reviewers have done. Otherwise, the place would be overrun. We love Mandalay Bay. One final word: if you are nice to someone, chances are excellent they will be nice right back....if you are demanding, discourteous, or snobby, don't expect niceness in return."

However, upon entering the guest room, I found several problems that showed me the guest rooms are poorly managed. First, one of the 2 trash cans was not emptied from the last guest that stayed there. Then, the in-room safe was still locked and not cleared. I had to call someone to come in and clear the settings. There were multiple sticky patches on the desk, which I ended up having to wipe clean with towels. All the lights were too dim and it was hard to read by the bedside and work at the desk. Their process for connecting to the Internet is more cumbersome than that in most other hotels. And at over $200 a night (already a special rate for conference attendees), there was not even a coffee maker or mini bar in the room. The value of this hotel is extremely poor! However, the restaurants are okay. I had a wonderful dinner at Aureole."

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because one of the pools was closed and finding chairs on a sunny Saturday was extreemly difficult for the 5 of us and the room doors SLAM shut, echoing down the long hallways - making sleeping late difficult (but no one goes to Vegas to sleep). I highly reccomend this hotel."

After being disappointed in my stay at the Luxor a few nights before this place was a breath of fresh air. The check in queue was long but moved quickly - we were upgraded to a 30th fllor room with a fabulous view of the strip because it was our honeymoon - we slept with the curtains open because the view was so good. The room was really impressive - with a big bath and beautiful shower, although it was quite far from the lift. The only problem was that we had to hang around for a few hours because the room wasn't ready but we did check in early and they did upgrade us so that's our fault really, but i was dying for a shower! We ate at the Lilly cantonese restaurant and the food was superb. The shark aquarium was also fantastic as my husband is fasinated by them so we spent a lot of time in there and watching the shark cam on the tele! We also ate at the Mexican and their food was fantastic too. The pool area was great although the beds were very close together which was a bit off putting and the charge for the lazy river floats was high but we did manage to haggle discount. The pool side assistance was excellent and the food at the pool bar was great too. I was really pleased with this hotel and although it is right at the end of the strip it isnt hard to get to other hotels as their is a tram to excalibur and then a walk way to MGM grand where you get the train - would highly recommend!"

When we checked in the person on the desk was grumpy and unhelpful, messed up the reservation and managed to spell my surname wrong despite it being on my passport, credit card and booking, all of which were in front of her. When later checking elements of my booking with other staff I got a different answer each time, there was not only no consistency but apparently no knowledge of how to do things. The hotel managed to double charge me and at the wrong rate and it's taken a while to get them to sort that and refund me. The room was impressive, though to get to it you have to use a lift lobby which is far too small for the volume of people passing through. The room was large with a nice big bathroom and nice toiletries. However, despite calls, housekeeping never came to clean it or change the towels the entire time I was there. Compared to some other hotels on the strip you are not really get much more for the higher room rate and I certainly wouldn't bother staying here again."

Also by using the trams you can get up and down the strip without a cab ride if you choose. There is an in house tram from Mandaley to Excaliber, then take overstreet walkway to MGM and you can get a tram ride there ($3) with stops all the way down to the Vegas Hilton. The only real problem is that any noise in the hallway outside your room carries into the room. The staff including the casino staff have a very positive attitude. All in all it's a Good choice."

Spa is niiiiice and reasonable. The buffet may be a little bit more expensive than other hotels, cheaper than Bellagio but with similar selections. Same price lunch if you go to Ceasar's but more selection. If you don't like buffet, there are all assortments of restaurants.

    "content": "I go to Manadalay Bay in the hot summer time because I love the soothing sound of the waves and like checking out the very pretty girls in bikinis. Any other time of the year I never go there. The walls between the hallway and the rooms are thinnest I have ever come across, so if anyone carries on a normal conversation as they walk past your door you will hear it from your bed. And the hallways are arternating marble and carpet which is very bad when the housekeeping and janitors roll their cart across it in the morning. CLU-CHUNK-CU-CLUNK, like a freight train. I like to sleep in while in vegas and was woken up out of a sound sleep at 9 am each morning by the housekeeping carts... and I was in a suite and so my bed was much farther from the door than normal rooms. So be sure to ask for a room at the end of the hall and away from other guests if you are a light sleeper. The pool is great on a hot summer day if you like to check out young ladies in bikinis and don't mind sitting on the edge of the water... getting a lounge chair is next to impossible, unless you are willing to lie on one where a towel has been left and see if someone kicks you out... since very few people seem to ever come back to their chairs, you might want to try that. I also had a lot of fun body surfing on the waves and so did the many little children I saw there. I don't think it is worth it to spend $40 to enter the private lounge... most of the pretty girls take breaks and leave the lounge and hang out in the wave area eventually. When it is not the hot summertime, I never stay here because it is too far off the center strip, and the rest of the casino is nothing special.... I just stay at the MGM. I had good experience with the staff, they were very helpful... but they seem overloaded to a certain degree. Since I had to wait a little extra during check-in I was upgraded to a suite. With theHotel taking over as the premiere hotel, the regular Mandalay bay suites are probably being given away as upgrades alot more now. One more thing: They tend to lower their prices about a week or less before a coming weekend, sometimes from $300+ down to the $100s. If you call, they will lower the price you already booked to the current rate, so I suggest that each day in the week leading up to your stay you check the prices on their website."

Never did she even say, \"Welcome to 3950.\" I think she needs to take a hospitality class. To make matters more akward, the door manager kept looking at our way. It made me feel so uncomfortable throughout my whole meal. The servers were good (service). But even leaving him a 30% tip, he had snubbed us all the way from then. After my experiennce, I will never go back. Felt snooty service for a very loud, small-sized restaurant with very tacky music. Would rather return to Aureole at the MB instead."

I was somewhat concerned about the negative reviews on this site, but was pleasantly correct in assuming that there are always those with the \"glass half empty\" mentality. There are thousands of people in Vegas with big bucks to spend, so don't expect too much, just go in with a good attitude and have a great time! Here's the rundown: THE GOOD: ~ Practically no line at check in (although we did arrive on a Wed. morning.) ~ After mentioning that we were celebrating our anniversary and asking if there were any complimentary upgrades (in my sweetest southern voice), the very nice attendant gave us a penthouse suite on the 60th floor!!! We had our own private bank of elevators, robes and slippers in the room and a full view of the strip. Awesome. ~ Room and bathroom were spotless \u2013 big plus in my book. ~ Lots of restaurants and entertainment to choose from. If you like oriental cuisine and want to have a really nice dinner experience, try Shanghai Lilly \u2013 it was awesome. The waiters cater to your every need and the food was fantastic, especially dessert. ~ Very nice spa \u2013 even if you don\u2019t book any treatments, you can pay $27 and have access to all of the facilities, including showers, lockers, whirlpool and sauna, plus they give you a robe to wear. The whirlpool was amazing, and I enjoyed reading a book on the comfy lounge chairs while listening to the waterfalls. ~ While we were there they had lots of comps - $25 dining credit, 10% off spa treatments, \u00bd price spa passes, and discounted Shark Reef tickets. THE BAD & UGLY: ~ Pools are amazing, but CROWDED, even on weekdays. Face it, they have the best pools, therefore the most people. By 10 am you will not find an empty lounge chair. My suggestion, if you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to get out there early, is to head straight for the South Lagoon Pool. Yes, it\u2019s smaller, less \u201cdecorated\u201d and not as much eye candy to look at, but I totally preferred the quietness and smaller crowd. Also hardly any kids over there. ~ There are lots of restaurants at MB, but as you\u2019ve probably read in earlier posts, they are indeed all expensive. Good luck finding anything on the strip that\u2019s not overpriced. It\u2019s just the way it is folks - come prepared. We knew that going in and so never complained or expected anything different. ~ Drinks at the pool are ridiculously overpriced, even by Vegas standards. ~ Employees in the hotel were plenty nice, but not out at the pool. No abundance of charm going on there. Overall, despite the few flaws, we enjoyed our stay and would stay there again. It really is an amazing resort."

Drinks are going to cost you...I paid $16 for a small and filled with ice long island ice tea. That was a tough lesson to learn. The waitress are sexy and good eye candy, but the problem was that you never find them. Drink service was slow to none in the casino. The MB is far from other strip casino except Luxor. Expensive dining and very little variety. If you not looking for value and more hype or status symbol this is the hotel for you."

The room was spacious and clean, the bathroom elegant and roomy. I loved the floor to ceiling windows! Ours overlooked the strip and it was quite a view, especially at night. We immediately went to the pool area, and it was packed! The wave pool and surrounding area was awesome, but go to the South lagoon, it's never crowded. We ordered a couple drinks and had a good lunch at the beachside cafe. That evening we attended the 'Mama Mia' show which I highly recommend! We never had any problems with an elevator wait and the coconut scented air was the best! The only bad experience was at Raffles restaurant. Poor service.The Coral Reef lounge was a great place to watch bands while having cocktails, and the Kona Cafe helped satisfy my Starbucks fix!

We visited the pools the first afternoon that we were there - very busy - no where to sit and no towels. The rest of the trip we spent the money to go to the Moorea Beach area. This was well worth the money. The cost to get in eliminates the gawkers and makes this an enjoyable place for a couple to spend the day. The restaurants at Mandalay Bay are great. I especially enjoyed the Rodizio at Rumjungle. The only thing I would change about our stay is that we may go when the rates aren't so low to reduce the crowd."

    "content": "The service here is TERRIBLE! After a miserable check-in experience (I felt like I was in O'Hare Airport), the room was so so. Then, when going to the Club Morrea (private pool to avoid zillions of kids), we were told \"the system is down\", and we could not charge it to our room, we needed CASH. Same once we got in for drinks - seems they'd rather we spend our cash any where but the casino. Talked to the front desk later, they said the system was down, but we should tell the workers to call the front desk - like we need to tell them how to do their job! We were told the problem was fixed. Later after dinner at Aureoule (great meal, great service, great everything), after we charged it to our room, as we left the maitre'd chased us down the area out front saying our charge was rejected. After showing him more id, etc. he agreed to let us go. I called up in the morning to complain again, they said they fixed the problem was fixed, but they LIE! We had the same problem at the pool later in the day we had the day before. To make matters even worse, we were awoken at 7 AM by screaming maids in the hallway outside our room - don't they realize people on vacation in Vegas generally are up late and sleep in - but not at the Mandalay. When we called the front desk again, and talked to a \"manager\", and told her we would need to check out two days in advance, she didn't even try to stop us, offer us an enticement to stay, or perhaps even APOLOGIZE! This is a terrible excuse for a \"resort\", they really don't give a damn about the people staying there."

    "content": "We stayed at Manadalay Bay with another couple for 5 days of August 7th. I read many of the reviews here and was slightly concerned, but we had a nightly rate of $129 Sun-Thurs, so I wasn't terrily upset considering the fantastic price for this property (price was $269 for Saturday night). In fact, when I originally booked the room online I got $149 for the first 2 nights and $129 for the second two. later, I saw the rate had dropped to $129 for all nights on their website, so I immediately called and they adjusted my rate to the lower price. Check-in was a breeze, even on a busy Sunday afternoon, and the other couple we were with was upgraded to a Strip view without extra charge, just by asking. A couple of comments: Mandalay Bay is BUSY and EXPENSIVE. You should know this upfront. The food is way overpriced (eat somewhere else) and the pool and elevators are crowded (the pool is well worth the crowd, but get there before 10 to get a seat) and the elevators, what can you do? Coffee and a bagel for 2 ran about $20 each morning. We had a lovely room with a partial Strip view which was in good repair and nicely laid out. tip the maids on the first day if you love the little toiletries, as I do! The soaking tub with bath salts is a really nice touch. Valet parking, however, is a nightmare. It takes forever. We were told one night when we returned at 1am that it would take 15 minutes to valet park our car and that one person needed to stay with the car at all times. There was only one staff person on duty--not his fault, and he was nice about it--but someone needs to address proper staffing. Another night our friend's room wasn't made up at all. This was because they had left the Do Not Disturb sign on the door all afternoon. She called and apologized for her mistake, and was told that someone would be up while we were at dinner to do the room. No one ever came. Upon checkout they very nicely talked to the staff about the room mix-up and their disappointments with valet parking, and the hotel comped them for that night's stay, which I thought was nice and appropriate under the circumstances. One more note: the restaurant Auerole in Mandalay Bay. It's exceptionally expensive. The service is well worth it, the food almost worth it, but the atmosphere is lacking a certain \"vibe\"--I wouldn't recommend it. Mandalay Bay--good in the summer for the pool and if you can get a good rate. But make sure you stand up for yourself or you will get lost in the crowd."

    "content": "I felt compelled to write a short review about Mandalay Bay. This was my husband and my first trip to Las Vegas, but we are quite well traveled. We mostly stay at four and five star type resorts. After booking M.B. for a long weekend (8/12 - 8/14) I was very concerned after visiting this site and reading their reviews. We did not stay at TheHotel, just plain old Mandalay Bay. It is a solid four star accomodation (not five - and I even saw a banner posted up in the hotel, proud of a AAA award (or similar) they just received, and received a 4 star rating). We had no line at check in and received an early check in (arrived around 9a.m. on a Friday morning). We also waited for an elevator only two or three times the entire weekend (and we waited five minutes MAX). We were on the 18th floor and experienced no noisy neighbors, whatsoever. The rooms are nice, but they are getting a bit worn. However, they were extremely clean. The tubs are not as big as I had expected - two normal sized adults will just fit - not really a \"romantic\" tub though. Again, just what I would expect from a four star accomodation. The pool areas were fabulous - sure they were busy, but again, we found lounging chairs every day and were not there at pool opening. You can always go in fairly early in the morning and put a magazine on a few chairs, and then go in the casino to eat breakfast/brunch, etc. The wave pool and lazy river were a great addition that I don't think any other resort offers. We found the staff to be quite helpful and definitely courteous. Sure, not exactly chatty or engaging, but just fine. We also asked for a late check out on Sunday, and were able to have our room until 1p.m. We had a GREAT trip and as long as you go to M.B. with the right expectation you'll have a great time."

    "content": "We decided to stay at the Mandelay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas for a short weekend vacation. We stayed there a year ago and really enjoyed the pool. This was the sole reason we went this time. Architecturally, this hotel is very pleasing. But as a business, this property is lacking in many ways. I encountered many employees that seemed more interested in prying money out of my pockets then performing the service they were employed to do. The wave pool area now has a section reserved for people willing to pay a premium to use the pool. It\u2019s approximately 10% of the beach area. This area has not there last year. We did witness the manager of the reserved area taking bribes from people that did not want to wait in line for the first come first serve area. Some of the chairs in the free side of the beach suddenly became reserved seating. The person working the entrance podium at the Raffles Caf\u00e9 completely ignored my wife as she stood in front of him. All she wanted to know was where she could get a cup of coffee at 5:30 in the morning. She returned to the room crying. The bartender at the pool bar gave a very sarcastic response after not being tipped. He served us a 12 ounce Pina Colada and a beer for $18. In my opinion, tipping is optional and is reserved for hotel employees who makes my life easier. If I\u2019m lying at the pool and a waitress takes my order and serves me drinks, I will tip that person. If I\u2019m sitting at a bar and want contiguous service from the bar tender over a period of time, I will tip that person. I am not tipping a person at a counter who served me a one-time order of a pre-mixed blended drink and a beer. My final observation deals with the room at the hotel. Pleasing to the eye and nicely maintained. But, two things were very loud in the room. Noises from the corridor were very easily heard in the room. Guests conversations, door knocks, slamming doors, etc. The other loud thing was the water saving, pressurized tank toilet. Every time you flush, it was like a bomb going off."

    "content": "This was our fourth stay at Mandalay and possibly our last. If we can find a deal at THE Hotel or the 4 Seasons (both hotels-within-the-hotel) we might reconsider. We booked an Executive Suite, which was roomy but - with the exception of the bathroom - quite ordinary. It included a tepid little refrigerator but no coffee maker. I think the Mandalay's rooms are starting to get a bit threadbare, especially the frayed and fading carpeting. In our room, there was no way to completely close the window curtain short of nailing it to the adjacent wall; every dawn, the morning sun blazed in our faces as we struggled to remain asleep. The TV offers a stingy handful of channels, and eight of them are nonstop Mandalay Bay ads. Wireless internet is $11+ a day, a bit steep just to check your email. Executives, the inconvenient business center is so far away from the main tower I think it's in a different ZIPcode. We've kept returning to the MB because it was classy yet unpretentious, and a pleasant and comfortable place to hang. While it still has that vibe, it's fallen victim to its own success. When at or near capacity, Mandalay Bay's infrastructure is not capable of keeping up with the human crush. This means interminable waits for the elevators (especially the measly TWO elevators earmarked for the parking lot), plus huge lines for check-in, restaurants and the Shark Reef. The main floor really needs a quick, 24-hour snack bar. The only late night dining (or take-out) is at Raffles, where the service is indifferent and the menu limited. Overall, we found the staff friendly and courteous, if a bit overwhelmed. They're not perfect, but great considering they spend all day trying to placate throngs of demanding guests. Speaking of crowds, good luck trying to relax at the Wave Pool. I suggest you keep walking to the South Lagoon Pool. While not exceptionally romantic (it's basically in the parking lot of the Convention Center), it's a lot quieter and more civilized than the scream-a-rama beach. The cabanas are unfinished but available and a must if you want a bit of shade, some elbow room, a whit of privacy, and a decent (if expensive) lunch menu. Casual dining is decent but costly. Fine dining is showy and overpriced, with the emphasis on flash over food. While the settings and presentations dazzle, the dishes are nothing special. For the same or less, there are much better experiences to be had elsewhere. The casino is well laid out and entertaining, although there are tons more machines at the MGM and better table gaming at the Bellagio. Unless you're planning on dropping several thou into the slots, I see no advantage in using their One Club card; I've been popping mine into machines for five years and haven't earned so much as a Snickers bar for my trouble. You get the sense Mandalay Bay kind of gave up on shopping, moving its handful of so-so, overpriced boutique shops out into the walkway between MB and Luxor. Caesar's, the Venetian and Bellagio all blow away the MB shopping experience. Finally, a warning about weekends: the Palms it ain't, but Mandalay Bay is a favorite weekend hang of the young, boozy, up-all-night party crowd. They stumble back to their rooms at around 3:45 am and make a multi-hour racket. You may luck out with quiet neighbors...but don't count on it."

I think I read reviews of the latter, and ended up with the former, the main complex of the Mandalay Bay resort. Our room, while spacious and with a nice view over the pool area, looked as if it had been the victim of too many wild Vegas weekends. The carpet was all stained, the TV cabinet was broken and there was a vague smell of cigarette smoke despite our choosing of a non-smoking room. We would have requested a change, but couldn\u2019t be bothered moving all the luggage after a long trip. And after all, in Vegas, you don\u2019t spend a lot of time in the room! Mandalay Bay is a nice resort if you have children in tow as they\u2019ll love the pool area. It was very busy when we were there in July, and you\u2019ll have to get up early to have any chance of reserving seats or sun-beds. Drinks are pretty expensive too. There is a good selection of restaurants, although we thought the buffet breakfast was poor in comparison to the Luxor next door. A taxi down to the other big casinos \u2013 like Bellagio, Wynn and The Venetian \u2013 is about ten dollars. It\u2019s too far, and too hot, to even think about walking. I\u2019ve stayed at The Luxor and the MGM Grand in Vegas, and Mandalay Bay is better than either, but I think next time I\u2019ll be trying somewhere else."

    "from": 384,
    "to": 705,
    "date": "August 11, 2005",
    "content": "I just got back from a vegas vacation and stayed at MGM and Mandalay Bay gambling roughly $10,000 of total \"action\" with bets ranging from $75 to $1000 per roll in craps and $50 to $500 in Baccarat. One great streak in craps at Mandalay Bay made me $2,500 from $200. I'm no stranger to vegas and have stayed and gambled in many strip hotels, the only reason I gave mandalay a try was for a party with friends. The hotel was very nice we had a parlor suite that has 2 seperate bedrooms and a large living area. Mini bars are a thing of the past in vegas and when I asked my bellman why my fridge was empty(and barely cold) he said that I should get the casino host to \"comp\" me to have it filled or I could pay to have it filled but quote, \"That would cost way too much\". Even the non-suites do not have mini bars. So the big catch 22 is that it's my first time in Mandalay and the casino does not care how big a gambler you are at other casinos, I was told they have a \"show me the money\" attitude. So I thought to myself, OK fine, I'll just charge everything to the room and see what they can do for me when I check out. After checking in I went and registered for the all important Players Card that allows pit bosses to track your play and then comp you accordingly. I was surprised to see that this same players card works in slot machines as well(not a big slots fan but good to see that the card works there as well). So I walk up to the craps pit and cash $1,000 ans start playing $15 pass with come and full odds(3,4,5). In minutes I have $100-$300 riding on the rolls. I played every day for hours over my 5 day stay and always gave my players card to the pit bosses before I played so I knew I was being tracked. Played a bit of a baccarat as well(about 4 hours total) but craps was my main game with well over 10hours of play time during my stay. Not trusting the \"charge to your room and we will comp you based on your play system\" I wisely asked the pit boss for a comp after one of my playing sessions, he gave me one for the buffet for 4 people valued at $96. This must be on top of my other comps(I'm thinking). As far as the Hotel, it is very nice but everything is over priced, even the famous WOLFGANG PUCK lasagna at the \"high end\" italian restaurant was bland and disappointing for its $20 Price tag. Also you cant get a drink with peace and quiet. You either have to gamble and drink, or sit down at one of the many 'lounges' on the casino floor and be prepared to yell and scream to your party because the live bands are so loud they want everyone to cut the small talk, and just drink and dance and party. This is fine but I was hoping for the option of at least sitting down and having a drink with friends and actually talking with them. SO NOW I CHECKOUT: At front desk and I give them my players card. They tell me that I must take my bill and my card to the \"players club\" and they will write some off for me. So fine I go to the Players club counter in the center of the casino where I was told to go, but these people can only comp slot related play so I'm sent to the real Players club elsewhere in the casion, all the while my party waiting outside with my luggage. As I enter this \"Players Lounge\" I see another disgruntled player in front of me debating with the \"Casino Host\" over thousands of dollars spent with no comps, I already get worried but not letting it phase me, I walk up to the \"Host\" and show them my checkout bill and my players card and ask what they can do for me. They look me up and say that I've been rated as a $70 per hour player. I calmly expalin to the host that I have gambled with over $10k bankroll in craps and my bets where often in the 100-300 range with some rolls having $500 per roll. At the least they under rated me by 3x. I was then told that the ODDS portion of the bets in craps does not get rated anymore(as of last week,, gee thanks), but even then my pass line and come bets were totalling well over $100. Before I debate this issue I simply ask, \"Ok well what can you do for me?\". And I'm told QUOTE , \"First of all sir, Mandalay Bay is the hardest hotel on the strip to get comps, I see that you had a buffet comp for 4 with $25 credit still available, but at this time I'm unable to offer you any discount to your bill\". In complete shock I calmly inform the host that this kind of play at the Aladdin would get me everything comp'd. She shrugs her shoulders and sends me to talk to the pit bosses about being rated too low and also advises me that for the \"future\" I should ASK every single pit boss that rates me what I got rated at before I leave the table(what fun). She also mentioned that I should refrain from moving craps tables as they find it hard to keep track of me in their huge craps pit of 8 tables.(I gave my players card to every pit boss at every new table I moved too and I always stayed more then 30 minutes per table). In the end they credited my $2.56 on my $3,000 bill and were not even willing to apply my $25 buffet credit to my bill. WARNING to any gamblers looking for comps: MB is the WORST place to gamble at and unless you plan on gambling $50K and fighting for a $3k bill to be cleared I would steer clear. I am NEVER gambling at this casino again and think its a DISGRACE that this casino is not more competitive. I will be mailing the Customer Relations people and speaking to managment about this negative experience. And for those that say, \"At least you get free drinks\". I say: Great but 8/10 waitresses dont know what a vodka paralyzer is and all the beer is luke warm. DO NOT GAMBLE AT THIS CASINO."

    "content": "My husband and I stayed at the Mandalay from July 17 to 20th. We were excited about staying at the Mandalay again because this was where we got engaged 5 years ago. Upon arriving, we checked in fairly quickly and got a room on the 34th flr. The room was a huge disappointment compared to the room we stayed in 5 years before. The theme of the 34th flr is the House of Blues so the room was decorated in gaudy bright colors and bad artwork. There were 2 burnt out light bulbs in the room and no one came up to fix them even after we called to report the problem. We are also non smokers and the room had ashtrays. The washroom door wouldn't close all the way and there were funny gurgling sounds coming from the sink every night. The only benefit to staying on the 34th flr is that you won't have any problems getting onto the elevator because it's the top flr. Most of the time when descending on the elevator we would see many other guests on lower floors not being able to get on because the elevator was already full. The day we were checking out, our elevator actually made a stop on every floor and couldn't pick up about 90% of the people waiting because it was full. The good thing about the Mandalay is the buffet. We had the dinner buffet and enjoyed the hot snow crab legs. They were huge! Service at the buffet was also very good. We also ate at Ruffles but there was a huge line up to get into the restaurant. It seemed there was a huge line up to get in there all the time. I think it's because it's the only restaurant opened late and there aren't many choices for late dining since Mandalay is so far away from everything else. The beach and wave pool were fun but very crowded. Lounge chairs were jam packed together. At our first visit 5 years ago, it wasn't that crowded at all. I would say that the Mandalay has degraded in terms of quality and service compared to our stay 5 years ago. I wouldn't stay here again unless there was a really good deal or we get upgraded to a suite. For sure, if you get a room on the 34th floor, ask for another floor. However, be prepared for the crowded elevators and allow yourself time each day for elevator delays."

Our room was very nice - it had sewing kits and bath salts, but a coffee maker would have been much more appreciated. A pot of room service coffee was about $15. Everything is expensive here - gambling ($15 bet minimums?), food ($75 entrees??), shops ($175 blue jeans???). $200 per night and they make you RENT/BUY an inner tube or water raft at the pool!

For some odd reason they gave us a handicapped room which took away the beauty of the bathroom, but we had beautiful view of the pool area. We did not have too much trouble with the elevator as other people posted. The elevator we took serviced floors 17 thru 34. The only thing I do recommend with the rooms is a COFFEEMAKER. For such a fancy hotel I can't believe they do not have the convenience of a coffeemaker in the room. In the morning had to go all the way to the casino level and go to a Starbucks which cost $4.00 a cup, what a rip-off. The pool area was beautiful, they did have enough towels for everyone. One problem I did encounter was not enough shaded area and if you got out to the pool after 11:00 AM good luck finding a chair. To go on the lazy river you had to either buy a tube for $9.99 or rent one for $20. I think that would have been a nice convenience if they just let people borrow them just for the day, like they do at water parks."

    "content": "My wife and I stayed at the MB from July 18-July21. The hotel was large and certainly had everything you would want (if you wanted to spend the money). We had the Buffet the first night for dinner, it was very good (the crab, shrimp, and scallops were excellent) but there wasen't a large selection of food to choose from, but I still enjoyed it. The room was nice, I will say nice, the bathroom was huge and great for 2 as it had 2 sinks, though the hairdryer was broken just hanging from the wall. We called for them to fix this, and they did. The A/C was on high (or at least it said it was) and was blowing low. We complained about this and they said a tech. was coming up to fix it and needless to say we are still waiting. The good: 1) Bathroom and room size 2) pool was alot of fun 3) late checkout without any problem The Bad: 1) staff really didn't want to be there, they weren't very polite. 2) A/C in rooms were horrible 3) the hotel was too far from anything and everything 4) not worth the money (we paid $109 per night) and that's cheap!!! 5) the pool area opened at 7am but they wouldn't let you near the wave pool or lazy river until 8:30am, therefore everyone charged at 8:30 for a chair. 6) restaurants were VERY expensive 7) some may disagree with this but we found that every time you mentioned to a cab that you were going to MB or were leaving from MB to go somewhere they always tried to rip you off by taking longer routes to your destination. We stayed elsewhere this trip and found from that location this was never happening. There is an assumption that if you stay at MB you have money, not necessarily the case. Both my wife and I agree that it was an experience to stay at MB, though we enjoyed Monte Carlo alot more for many reasons. MB is NOT a 5 star hotel by any means, it may have been once, but no longer. It ranked a 4 star tops. If you don't mind traveling alot by car or cab to other hotels, this might be for you. The machines didn't pay at all (no big winners when we were there) and the tables had high limits even during the day(no less than $15 on BJ). I hope this helps anyone deciding whether or not they want to stay there, just be forwarned..... MB is now more run down and attitude is everywhere. Forgot to mention....our room housekeeper was fantastic, we tipped her everyday($2-5) and she treated us like royality. She was the only staff member to put a smile on our face."

They didn't have a king bed room available in the room size that we booked so they upgraded us to a suite on the fourth floor. No view but the room was very large and excellent! This hotel has multiple pools, a wave pool and a lazy river. The staff came around regularly to see if anyone needed drinks, which was great. The casino was pretty much like all the others. The House of Blues restaurant in the hotel had surprisingly good food at affordable prices. What I loved most about the Mandalay Bay was that it was away from the others, at the end of the strip. A free tram in the hotel takes you to the Luxor and then to the Excalibur, which is right beside New York New York and across the street from the MGM Grand. Very convenient. All visitors should take the monorail all through the strip round trip for $6. I will definitely be staying at the Mandalay Bay on any future trips."

When we called down to the front desk they said they would change the sheets immediately, bring up new glasses and that the air conditioner was just turned on and to give it time. About an hour later we received new sheets and glasses and went out to explore the town. When we got back 3 hours later the room was even hotter. They sent someone up at 2:00 a.m. to take a look at it. Needless to say that didn't help. We called down in the morning to ask to be be moved. They proceeded to move us to an even hotter room.. and then again down to another room. The whole time.. no apologizes.. however a $50.00 credit. WHOPPEEE. When we went to check out they had two additional room charges on the room that weren't even ours. When i asked to speak to a manager.. guess what.. they were all busy. They credited the bill (geez surprise surprise it wasn't even our charges). I then asked for a comment card... guess what.. they were out of them. It got to be a joke because every time we got on the elevator someone was complaining about their room. I would of thought this place would of been 10x better. Needless to say .. our first trip to Vegas will be our last .. well at least for another 10 years."

    "content": "My family stayed at Mandalay Bay from 7/19 to 7/22/05. We were looking forward to our stay as we had heard good things from other people who had stayed there. What a disappointment!! Our room was on the 14th floor. The hall to the elevators were crowded no matter what time of day it was. The room was decent but the afternoon sun was blasting our window. We had to keep the curtains shut all the time to reduce the heat in the room. The a/c was set on cool but there is no temperature control. It was 116 degrees outside and the room never cooled to comfort. There was no way to lower the a/c. The bathroom was large but dimly lit. There were missing sections of tile around the tub. The walls in the toilet area were filthy with splashes of something. The in room magazine listing things that were going on at the resort was dated from the week prior. Two of our three nights, the guests next door were so loud with their children that we didn't sleep well. The walls are paper thin. There is no food court so the resort holds you captive to eat at their pricey restaurants unless you leave their grounds. I always thought the object was to make your stay most convenient so you wouldn't leave and go elsewhere to spend your money. Guess I was wrong. We went to the pool area. One of our 3 keys was invalid so the pool attendant took the invalid key and wouldn't let us all go in. My son and husband went into the pool area and I went to the front desk to get a valid key. The lobby clerk wanted ID. My ID was in the room. My husband and son have the room keys in the pool. I can't get into the pool to get the room key to get my id because my invalid key was taken from me. The clerk was completely clueless how to handle this. I offered all the information I had regarding check in/check out dates, names, addresses, phone numbers, room numbers and the names of the guests in our room. She finally let out an exaggerated exhale and handed me a key but it was only to get into the pool area. I go to meet my family at the pool to find them sitting on a wall stating there was no place to sit. We inquired about the lounge chairs around the pool. We were told we could reserve 2 chairs for $50 a day. We wandered around and finally set our towels down and went to get rafts for the lazy river. We discovered the rafts had to be rented or purchased. We decided to purchase 3 rafts for $30 as it was cheaper than renting. We had to pay $2 to rent a locker so we had a place to put our clothes and shoes. We enter the lazy river and upon our second time around my son slices his foot open on something under the waterfall. We get out of the river and realize it's a slice about 1 1/2 inches long and fairly deep. I asked a lifeguard to clean the sand out of the cut. An EMT was called. She used an antibacterial wipe to clean the wound but couldn't get all the sand out. She told my son to soak his foot in the spa as it was hot water and highly chlorinated. She advised that soaking his foot would eventually release the remaining sand in his wound. At that point my son sat there while we went to the locker to get his shoes. He couldn't walk to the spa without getting more sand in his wound. The EMT asked me if I wanted to file a report. I did. We filed a report and left the pool area. We went back to the room. The rest of the trip my son limped. It then cost us to use the monorail since it was hard for him to walk. At no point did anyone from the hotel contact us about his injury or how he was feeling. The resort was over priced, the staff was rude and not helpful. We go to Las Vegas once a year and will never stay at Mandalay Bay again."

    "content": "I have stayed at Mandalay Bay three times so far and am preparing for a stay there next week. Mandalay Bay is generally excellent, in my opinion. Each time I have stayed there (August 2004, December 2004, March 2005), I have enjoyed my experience. Some positives for me: -Clean rooms. I find Mandalay Bay's rooms to be very clean. I am a health freak, but can comfortably sleep in the room without worrying that the sheets have someone else's bodily fluids all over it or dirtyness. The bathroom areas were generally clean. -Decent food. You can find all kinds of things to eat at Mandalay Bay. Sure... many things may seem very overpriced, but a major part of going to Las Vegas is spending money. I'd recommend, if you decide to go there, that you try Raffles Cafe'. Yes, some of the things are on the expensive side, but it is a casual place and open 24 hours, so if you need to go down for something to eat in the middle of the night, it is good. However, it is busy a lot of the time. -Pool Area. I liked the pool area. There are a few smaller pools, a lazy river, and a wave pool. It is a great way, in my opinion, to kill a few hours on a hot Las Vegas summer day. However, it does get quite crowded. The pools have lifeguards. There is a bar and grill outside in the pool area and a store that sells bathing suits, pool toys, sunscreen, and snacks. -Shopping! Some people may find the shops in Mandalay Place to be too expensive, and most of them are expensive. But, I did go to Urban Outfitters, and got some trendy clothes for not too much money. They also have books, games, and other items. But, really, if you are on a tight budget, there may not be that much for you to even consider buying in the shops. But, you can still look! -Shark Reef. I have a local aquarium that I could go to, but I have visited the Shark Reef once and it is a great experience, especially for kids, in my opinion (I am only 13 myself), because it provides an educational experience, while still being entertaining. You get to even touch some of the animals. It is not too expensive, but if you just are not interested in sea creatures, or do not want to spend the money, I would not recommend this for you. But, for families with kids, I would recommend. I probably did not list all of the things I found to be positive. Now for the negatives: -Crowded. Mandalay Bay is usually somewhat crowded when I go there. The main walkway was always very crowded. The pool area, like I said, is also crowded during the summer time. -Not much to do for kids. There is the pool during the summer and Shark Reef, but this is more of a young adult type place. Really, Las Vegas is not a kids place anyways, so you can pretty much expect that at most hotels you go to. However, there is tram that runs to Luxor and Excalibur, and they both have arcades and Excalibur has a large kiddie area, so if you do decide to stay at Mandalay with kids, you can go over to those places easily. -Long lines for restaurants. If you want to eat here, expect long lines at some food places. That is all I have to say. I personally think this is a great, clean hotel, but remember to take into consideration what other's have to say. And all of this was just my opinion. -Impressed in California"

Bellhops/doormen very good, easy getting cabs, hold doors for you. 4. Casino is very plain, noisy and boring. Cocktail waitresses seem uninterested and at times a little hostile. 5. Pool is pretty but very crowded, not enough towels. Bar/restaurant service at pool is fine, but the towel/pool attendants are quite lazy, water is so warm it feels like a bath(not very refreshing). 6. Rooms are very nice and housekeeping is right on top of cleaning. Overall my impression is that the hotel has you captive and does not really care if you are satisfied or not. Wynn and Belagio appear to be better choices."

    "content": "We stayed at Mandalay Bay from July 15-17 and loved it! We checked in ay 9:30 AM and got right into our room. We asked for a room in the lower bank of evevators and was glad we did as there were lines for the elevators as the evenings wore on. We found the staff to be very efficient. Not overly friendly, but they probably get asked the same questiosn over and over so I wasn't expecting overly friendly staff. No one was rude and all were friendly. My husband and I went with our 7 year old son. From reading other reviews I was concerned the pool area would be over-run with twenty-somethings looking to hook up and swearing a lot. But it wasn't so. The lazy river was very much the family friendly area, and the wave pool too. It was crowded but not uncomfortably so. Twice when we entered the pool area and had to show our room key to get in, they were turning away the group ahead of us for not having there key. I'm glad they are strict on this or the place would be over-run. The wave pool can get rough for the younger children. Our son has a few scrapes from being pushed over the concrete - but he had no complaints!! The grounds are beautiful - really love the mini water sprays that cool you down (it was 116 both days!!). Our room overlooked the pool area which we really liked (also could see part of the airport). We felt like we spent the weekend at the beach not on the strip which we loved. We didn't spend much money on food. Breakfast was from the ice-cream/coffee place on the beach level - great coffee and ok pastries. One lunch was at Border Grill - excellent! Had room service one night. Kind of a long wait (45 minutes) but food was good and hot enough. No towels were available Sunday morning when the pool opened, but that wasn't a huge deal. I think your attitude determines how much you enjoy your stay. We are forgiving of less than servant-style service and go with the flow. We'll definately be back!"

    "content": "My company had a conference at MB. Not being a 'high roller', I guess I was not worthy of any kind of basic customer service, but no one deserves this experience. They put me in 3121. Was pleased with this room. Not too close or too far from elevators. Also, I learned that it's far better to sacrifice a great view and get a room in the lowest bank of elevators. Even better to be among the first few floors in that bank. While coworkers on higher floors had to fight crowds to get elevators and had to wait while theirs stopped at 15 different floors, I had no problem getting to and from my room. On night one, I nearly busted my butt on the slick bathroom floor. I then noticed that water was dripping through the ceiling next to the light fixture in the shower. Some of the water ended up on the floor. The dripping seemed to short out the toilet light. I also noticed that about 4 bulbs in the room were burnt out. The dripping stopped after an hour and I gave it no more thought. It was the next morning that I noticed the toilet light didn't work. I called housekeeping and a maintenance man quickly arrived to check the lights and change the burnt out bulbs. He did mention that there had been a busted shower head on the floor above on the prior day. I had to head down to work and we seemed to have a friendly rapport, so I left him to do his thing. I came back a few hours later and noticed that the bathroom stank pretty badly. Then I noticed that there was some yellow liquid in the bath tub. There was a bunch more yellow liquid on the raised part of the tub, where the soap sits. I couldn't believe what I was seeing: the maintenance man had urinated all over the bath tub!!! It was highly concentrated and stank something awful. I called housekeeping and they didn't seem to know what to do. I went to the front desk to complain about this situation and one other: MB charges 27 bucks a day to use the gym. I had bought a 5 day pass (for 85) and then noticed that no one ever asked me for it when I used the spa facilities. I had wrongly figured that there was tight security on the gym and spa areas. I immediately felt duped. I told the front desk that I felt ripped off b/c anyone could wander in and out of the gym, and now I feld urinated on too. I told her that a good way for her to make things up to me would be to comp me the gym usage, which basically doesn't cost them anything. She did not want to comp me much of anything. The supervisor said that she talked to maintenance, who said that 'there had been an overflow on the floor above and what I saw had to have been from the overflow.' She offered to move me to a suite and to comp me only 2 days of the 5 day pass. So basically, the maintenance man urinates all over my tub, and they won't do anything that actually costs them any money. They wouldn't even comp me a gym pass for my stay. I went back to move out of 3121 and examined things closely: there were NO drips from bathroom ceiling, NO drips along the walls. This was NOT dilute toilet water or plumbing water. It was 100% freshly squeezed morning urine, and the MB didn't really care and made no effort to look into it or make things up to me. I moved to a suite on 7th floor. Two burnt out bulbs in new room, but no way I'm calling maintenance again. This room has a bar sink that contains lots of whiskers from some prior guest. Other than that the room is pretty good. The poor cust service continued when I had different employees tell me: that they could hold a key for my wife's arrival, they could not hold a key for wife's arrival (I'd have to physically bring a key to them), they don't hold keys at all but instead make the key on the spot. Glad to get out of here and no way I'd stay here again. Other tidbits: Spa/Gym- exceptionally nice. Head down the 'spa' hallway til it ends, take a left, and go right into gym. 95% chance no one will hassle you at all. Feign ignorance if they do. In the locker areas, there is coffee, juice, muffins, etc. Buffet - Was great. Lots of great desserts. Shopping - the stores are all exclusive and way too pricey for me. I wish our conference had been at Alladin, which has a great, affordable, mall attached."

    "content": "When you walk in Mandalay, unlike every other casino hotel, you walk into a real hotel lobby. You're not in the casino trying to find a lobby. It's beautiful, and tropical, and even smells lightly of the beach. I wish I could bottle the scent of the place. Just to warn you, you'll tip when you drop your luggage with the bellstaff and then again when you get your bags delivered to the room. So it's a little bit of a double dip, but most all of the major hotels do this now. Check in was easy and when asking for an upgrade got an Executive Suite that was schweeeeet! Love the room, excellent amount of space and a PRIMO bathroom. The sunken tub was a nice treat and the shower is big enough to share! Even a phone in the bathroom for the Archie Bunker's in the crowd. LOL! Highly recommend: Raffles and the Bayside buffet. Great servers that can handle special requests (I like a lot of foods plain or without sauces). For cheaper (but great) eats, go into the sports book. We wished we had found that place earlier. If you aren't gambling (and why not) right off the floor is a souvenir shop where you can get drinks like wine coolers cheaper than at the bar. Go next door to Pharoh's Pheast for an excellent breakfast buffet! It's our favorite and is inexpensive. We really like that you can get to Luxor and Excalibur easily (monorail or walking through connecting casinos). If you're a VIP or know someone --- go all the way up to the Foundation Room. OMG! Incredible. I think you can also pay to get in. Very upscale, so dress with that in mind. Very classy with an incredible view. I also hear that there is a killer bar over in The Hotel next door with a 360 degree view of the strip. We worried about being on the extreme south end of the strip but had no problems. If you want, there is a Dollar Rent A Car in the hotel (downstairs not far from the pool). Anyone that complains about walking in their reviews doesn't know anything about Vegas. It's like going to Disney. Be prepared for some major walking and ALWAYS wear comfortable shoes. If you don't like walking be prepared for cabs, or car rentals and valet parking. Vegas ain't for wimps. Our first trip had average temps of 105 and you dehydrated stepping outside the door. Drink lots of water. The pool! OH MY! It's awesome, but be prepared to enter a meat market. I'm a 33 year old female and I swear you can smell the testosterone of the guy groups all huddled by the cabanas. I wish the pool hours went later, but I'm sure with that huge wave pool they are watching their insurance liability of people getting too drunk during the night and getting hurt at the pool area. I enjoy the pool experience and if you want a quieter time, just go to one of the smaller pools. One big tip about Mandalay and all of Vegas. The key is $15 dollars a head. For anything. Seriously. Every time we took a cab -- $15. Every art museum, Shark Reef, many meals, etc. for some reason work out to right about $15. So be sure to know this in working out your budget. I've always heard that your odds are better in the North Strip, but we haven't made it there yet for a day trip. We've toured all of the hotels and love, love, love Mandalay. Great restaurants, pool, service, rooms, and casino. Two thumbs up."

    "content": "My husband and I stayed at MB for our 15th anniversary (renewed our vows) and loved it! Because we checked in so late, we were unable to get a king bed, so she made sure to give us a view of the strip. We had the 17th floor- perfect because it's the first floor off the second elevators so we never waited long. Only once did we see a line for the upper elevators, so we just took the lower elevators to the 16th floor and then walked up one floor. Our room was very clean and the amenities like the bath salts were great! A couple we traveled with stayed at THE HOTEL. That name became very confusing (cab drivers, etc). THE HOTEL has suites and is very upscale and modern, but I actually preferred the resort rooms instead. The facilities are beautiful. We took our wedding photos in front of the waterfalls at the entrance. I love the scented air that is pumped into the entire resort. Everything is light an airy- even the casino! The buffet is really good, very reasonable, and had a huge variety. Rumjungle was a bit expensive, but worthwhile to do once. It's impossible to get coffee between 2am-6am and there is a line when it is open. Hint- go to the ice cream shop on the Beach Level. They also have coffee and it is less crowded. As another person wrote, is very difficult to get drinks at the casino, but we didn't drink that much, so it was ok. We didn't spend much time at the regular pools. Hint: bring your own tubes and blow them up yourself for the lazy river, rather than renting (much cheaper). You can then either leave them there or deflate them and take them home. You can use flat floats in the regular pool. Recommend a quick trip to WalMart and just buy your own rather than renting. I highly recommend the adult pool. We were charged $10 for women and $40 for men, but it really was worth it. It's quieter, good sound system, and very well catered by the staff. We were seated right away in a shady area. The ice towels and cold water jacuzzi were wonderful on a July day. Personally, we liked the location of the resort. You're at the South End so you're not so submerged into the Vegas experience. It was also close to our wedding chapel- Little Church of the West. You get a view of the entire strip and other hotels are just a tram ride away. Hint: put on your walking shoes and walk to the Stratosphere one night. We did that the first night- started about 2am and watched the sunrise over the mountains at the Stratosphere, then we walked about halfway back, ate breakfast, and hopped on a bus the rest of the way back. Along the way we stopped at most of the hotels and felt like we saw everything. When we arrived back, the pool had just opened, so we slept by the pool. Do NOT buy your shuttle when you book your rooms. You still have to wait in line to pick up your voucher and it isn't any savings. The wait for a shuttle was alomst an hour, but we felt stuck because we had prepaid. Otherwise, we would have just taken a cab. Final Hint: Before you leave for Vegas, make reservations for the spa for your final day. Many people who tried to make reservations on site had no luck. Doing this on your last day is the best way to \"detox\" before going home. You have to pay to use the spa and fitness center unless you have a spa service, then you can come and go for free the entire day. We went to the fitness center early in the morning and enjoyed the complimentary juices, fruits, muffins, etc... After that we used the jacuzzi pools and each had a massage. After the massage, I used the eucalyptus steam room and cold plunge pool. We had already checked out of our room, so I used the spa to get ready for the plane. They have everything you need including razors, curling irons, shampoo, and even neatly packaged loofahs! The whole experience was incredibly endulgent. It was the perfect way to end a trip to Vegas."

    "content": "Just got back from Vegas. We were there for the 4th of July week. Firstly, we went to the pool everyday at various times and never ever had a towel. They were always out of towels and had requested that we go back to our rooms and get towels. Keep in mind that to get to your room you had to wait on line to get an elevator to your room (crowds of people). They are not prepared for all these guests at the hotel. This hotel is not worth the money you pay for. Buffet (breakfast was good) pricey but good. King size bed was horrible. I actually felt springs on mattress. Bathroom was not kept. It was obvious that the maid spent 5 minutes if that to clean entire room. Furniture very dusty, air conditioner did not cool off quickly. I really wished that my hubby had listen to me when I said I would rather go to Scottsdale, AZ and stay at the Fairmount. Now thats a 5* hotel. Lastly, Mandalay Resort is the first on the strip; therefore, lots of walking is required to go to the other hotels/casinos. P.S. Do not waste your $ on that Shark Reef You can walk through within 15 minutes which will cost you $20.00 per person. I say, use that $ to gamble instead."

    "content": "First of all I would like to say that Mandalay Bay is our place! We love the hotel. We love the pool. We love the spa. We love the restaurants. We used to love the rooms. Not anymore. We stayed a couple of nights in the new part THEhotel and then switched over to save some $$. Do not do this. Remain in THEhotel. I was on the 23rd floor. It smelled musty almost like a smoking floor. I opened the door to my room and was just upset. The carpet was stained, the door to my amoire broken, and all of the furniture was very worn. The bedspread was suprisingly new. The bathroom was in excellent condition and I really enjoyed it, but THEhotel bathroom is even better. The pool opens at 7am, but they have the wave pool section closed until 8:30am. I suggest grabbing some coffee and getting out there no later than 7:45am because you will need to get in line for the wave pool. This is hilarious, but worth it. They literally will blow a whistle and everyone charges to grap their chairs. I was one of the 5 people on the first row and I didnt get all 4 chairs. I only got three, but the couple next to me gave up one because they only got one instead of two. If you are getting more than 3 chairs - dont do it alone. You will need additional help. It was actually kind of fun. Like races at a family picnic! The restaurants are always good. The buffet is excellent. China Grill is awesome. Get the Crackling Calamari salad and the Shanghai Lobster. Rum Jungle is a great place for some lunch (cheaper than dinner) and drinks and William is EXCELLENT. Ask for him. Tell him to hook you up. Even if you need to leave earlier than you want he can make you a drink \"to go\"! Red Square EXCELLENT martinis. I had the Russkie. It was a banana martini with a long banana chip that was dipped in chocolate. YUMMY. I would like to say that any decent restaurant is going to cost you. There were two of us at the Red Square for cocktails and appetizers. We each had 3 martinis and an appetizer - after tip - $150.00. Drinks and appetizers at the Rum Jungle for 3 people were much better - Still $150.00, but for 3 people instead of 2. Dinner at China Grill for 2 people with one drink each $198.00 (includes tip). The spa is just wonderful. I went down early in the morning to secure my lounge chair. I would get some coffee, get settled in, read, and then get a treatment around 6am. Come back to my spot and then read a little and then just snooze until like 10am! Everyone did this. The sound of the waterfalls just puts you too sleep. Other recommendations for dinners are the Mesa Grill over at Caesar's. My most enjoyable meal. The waitstaff is beyond trained. We also ate at Sushi Roku. Excellent food, EXCELLENT VIEW! Service STINKS. If you plan on eating well, expect to spend about 250.00 per family of 4-5. Buffets for dinner will cost you 1/2 that. So it is all really up to you on how you want experience vegas."

    "content": "Let me begin by saying my husband and I are both in our early 40's and travel to Vegas twice a year and always stay at Mandalay Bay. We visited 7-5 / 7-8 2005. I booked directley with the hotel. If you have one of the hotels ONE CLUB card use the number on the back while booking. We got a rate of $119.00 a night. We were staying over Friday night but the rrom rate jumped to $229.00 so for the last night of our trip we booked a room at Luxor for $109.00. Check in. Arrived at the hotel at 9:00am and went to VIP check in, when you book your room with the phone number on the back of the card you can use the VIP check in line which is generally less crowded. Get uo to the girl and she says I'm in the wrong line. Couldn't or wouldn't explain to me why? Luckly at this time of the day the lines weren't bad so I moved over 2 feet to the next line. The check in girl couldn't crack a smile I bet you if I had given her a $50. She never made eye contact with me. She proceeded to tell me that I should be in the VIP line. I told her we just were there and the previous girl told me I was in the wrong line. She made a nasty snorting gesture and checked me in. When I booked over the phone I requested a pool view. Again, normally when using the card phone number they are able to grant your request. My husband and I get to our room and have a lovely view of the roof top air conditioner units. I know I shouldn't be so picky on views but I was. We proceeded back to the check in area, back to the VIP line that I was in no more than 10 minutes ago, back to the original girl who originally told me I was in the wrong line. Told her we just checked in and I wanted a pool view. She had no idea she didn't wait on me 10 minutes ago.This time and I got my pool view. Pool Area- Yes, MB probbaly has the best pools in Vegas. They have 5 pools. The wave pool with the sandy beach area is the favorite. The pool area fills up quickly. To get a primo spot you really need to get to the pool no later then 10:00am. Once situtiated, you have to contend with the endless number of kids running around. I am by no means a kid hater. My husband and I have 3 teenagers. But I just don't get the number of people who bring the kids with them to Vegas. The waitress was always around for drinks. With the Vegas heat I could't stay at the pool for more than a couple of hours. The hotel elevator goes down to the beach level so it's nice not to have to walk thru the caisno in your bathing suit attire. We ate twice at the House of Blues for breakfast. Keep your receipt. If you dine the next day with them you get Buy one get one free breakfast. Ate at the buffett once for breakfast it was ok. Went off the property for all our other meals. The hotel is showing just a little wear and tear and the employee's act like they don't want to be there. I don't need alot of coddling, I'm big girl now but it would be nice if they could smile or say thank you once in awhile. My husband and I play black jack and normally not at MB the table minimums are $25.00. This trip they had one $10.00 table and 4 $15.00 tables, so I sat at a $15.00 table. Wasn't lucky and the dealer was probably glad I got up and walked away so he could get a short breather. The hotel caters to the middle 20 year olds who come in from CA. Most are obnoxious and act like they want to get a rise out of the 40 year olds by using the F bomb every other word. Remember, I'm in my 40's and have 3 teenagers not to much phases me. After awhile you just get tired of hearing it. To finish this review I would just say that our next trip will not be at MB. We'll probably stay next door at the Luxor. We do most of gambling there anyway, and on our last day checked in to the hotel. Read my review on Luxor."

Husband loved the fact that buffett was changed to lunch right on time and not before hand. Waitress first day was great. The tram to the other two hotels was a great help in getting around. The down side to Mandalay are: Unresonable rates during weekends. We chose to move hotels our last night because of this. Most of the restaurants in the hotel are WAY too pricey. We went to other hotels for food except the morning buffett. Pool towels were out by ten on a weekday? The wait was two hours. We couldn't believe this, but it only happened once out of three times we went. Thank goodness. Housekeeping knocks and then proceeds to walk in TOO fast. Take it from me...lock your top lock. I was in the bathroom once when the water guy came around! The internet wifi costs 12 dollars per laptop every 24 hours. This can get pricey with non business type people. I was shocked when you are paying such a high price anyhow. Also, the lazy river floats cost too much in my opinion. As another reviewer said...just wait till late in the day and take one sitting around the pool. We did this and had a good time. Check out time is crazy with so many people in the elevators. There about eight of them, but it's still crowded and sometimes a long wait with so many rooms. And last...I had never been to Vegas before and thought it was wierd how the bellman take your stuff down to some room and then deliver it. I was NOT about to give over my laptops to them. Parking was adequate, but a pain for someone with an oversized vehicle since you have to park so far away. The weather in the summer is 105 as a high most days. Stay inside the casinos! this is not their fault, but I rarely saw them giving out free drinks to people."

Most reviews were positive and I assumed that the few negative reviews were probably just isolated cases. Unfortunately, I discovered otherwise within hours of my arrival at the hotel. After waiting 30 minutes to check in, I soon went to check out the beach/pool area for which the hotel is known. Within a few minutes of entering the pool area, I was chased after by a hotel employee asking to see my room key. I showed it to him and asked why he wanted to see it since I had just shown it at the pool area entrance. The employee said that he had seen me pass something to someone outside the enclosed pool area and that I would now have to speak to the pool manager. Since this entire situation was completely fabricated by the employee, I expressed my annoyance to the pool manager who then admonished me for having a poor attitude. I then told her I was going to complain to the hotel manager, which I did. The response I got from him was that the hotel was doing me a favor by not pursuing the matter further. Now, given that I had done nothing wrong at all, I was quite upset by this ridiculous incident. (I learned later that the hotel staff thinks some non-hotel guests are sneaking into the pool area using other people's room keys, but that's hardly an excuse for what happened to me.)"

Housekeeping picked both up quickly but that is unaccpetable. Secondly, we left two bathing suits in our room at checkout. We quickly discovered the mistake and called the hotel the next day. After five days of calling to housekeeping, guest relations, and security, we finally found somebody who was helpful. They will pay for the loss since they have no control over their housekeeping staff. My spin is that the management has let the flagship hotel slip since they opened the more expensive The Hotel. Beware of the Mandalay - it ain't what it used to be."

It took about 30 minutes to check in by that time you just want to get everything up to your room and lay down because just think you've just got there from the airport which of course you are going to be there for a long but you think by the time you get to your hotel you would at least have some help, but that is only if you look like you got the money or if you start waving it around. So needless to say I had to drag my luggage to my room. Well after a couple hours of laying there retaining my energy I decided to go down stair gamble and have a drink, or so I thought as I was sitting in the same spot for over an hour gambling not once did a waitress come and ask if I wanted anything. I stayed at the Mandalay Bay for 6 nights and 5 days and everyday it was like that I would have chase down a waitress to get a drink and they were so rude but yet expected a tip. I work in a Casino and that is the first thing they tell us. Youwant someone to respect you well you give it in return."

Barely any eye contact and it seemed all to much effort. There were also no porters available to help me with my very large and heavy suitcase, so I had to contend dragging it upstairs by myself. The rooms themselves were very average for what they charge per night though I have to say the bathrooms were huge and impressive. The bath salts were a lovely added touch too. I found trying to sleep in this hotel difficult - too close to the airport so every few minutes you are subjected to hearing planes taking off across the way.

Hard to complain with that. Food was good, service just so-so. Workers tend to be young and indifferent. Ate at Charley Palmers Steakhouse and loved it. It's part of Four Seasons I think. Anyway, the Pool was also huge and uninviting. The lazy river is anything but. The pool is for young and loud 20 somethings. All in all, I'd go back to Mandalay Bay regardless of the negatives. Don't let the location stop you. Its easy to hop on the Monorail which heads up the Strip to Luxor and NY/NY. You can then cross over the Strip to MGM and hop on the new Monorail there to go up Strip. MBay isn't Bellagio but what is."

There was also a hole in the room wall from someone bashing the door handle into it, (the door stop was ripped out). The floor was kind of fun, great view, but not for everyone. On the negative side I found the service at Mandalay poor overall. We encountered too many rude dealers & waitresses. Everything was expensive. Its nearly impossible to get a free drink in the sportsbook. The pool was ok but overrated and the lazy river was a total joke. On the positive side, the Mandalay has a lot of things to do right in the hotel. It has good restaurants, bars, & nightclubs. The hotel clientele is mixed but there are definately a lot of younger people. I didn't think it was worth the money and I do not intend on staying there again."

(For those who don't know, the casino, shops, lobby, etc. all have this tropical coconut type of smell - it's best compared to suntan lotion and it is heavenly.) The beach and lazy river are also pretty incredible, but too crowded for my tastes. We were there from 3-6pm on a Tuesday afternoon and had a hard time finding a chaislounge. It's difficult for me to relax with people constantly walking back and forth in front of me, listening to kids yell, etc. But no biggie. The wait for drinks was also very long. And speaking of drinks...$7.50 for a margarita, which is fine, but the drinks are WEAK. We each had 3 and the only \"buzz\" we felt was brainfreeze from drinking them too quickly... Our room was very clean and quiet and had a great view of the pool. Good sized bathroom with nice toiletries and plenty of room for two people to get ready. I was also impressed with the closets - they are the kind you might find in a home vs. looking like the typical \"hotel closet,\" if that makes sense. Only real room complaint would be that the A/C seemed very weak. My \"special someone\" and I took a nap one afternoon and woke up sweating even though the A/C was turned to \"high.\" I thought maybe it was ME who was getting him all hot and bothered, but no, it was the fact that it really was about 90 degrees in our room. The thought of possibly switching rooms or having a repairman come up, seemed like too much hassle, especially since we planned on being gone the rest of the day - so we let it go. The only MB restaurant we tried was The Border Grill, located by the pool - good service, but pretty bland food, especially for the price. We live in California and have lots of great Mexican places though, so maybe we've been spoiled. The MB convention center is awesome! The bartenders/cocktail servers working the convention were especially fun and friendly. There was a \"surprise concert\" that night - Huey Lewis and the News!! Very random, but it was great fun. Enjoy your travels, everyone, but don't forget to be safe. It's a jungle out there..."

    "content": "We've always loved walking around Mandalay Bay. The public areas are beautiful, the restaurant selection is wonderful, and the pool areas are spectacular. Finally, we around to booking a room there. What a disappointment. Only one of the following service glitches was a serious one, but they add up to a big demerit for a place so expensive and supposedly upscale. First, as we stood in one of the individual lines for check-in clerks, just as we got to the front we were whisked out of our line by a hotel employee who we thought was offering to check us in herself. No -- she was just moving us to another line, and suddenly that line was longer than the one we were in! Fortunately, the people who moved up in our old line let us back in. Then, the biggies. Our check-in clerk was making us her last chore of the day, and it showed. First, she didn't give us any of the coupons that were part of the rate deal we booked under. When I mentioned it, her response was \"Oh, I'll see if we have any of those lying around.\" They did, it turned out -- but it didn't seem as though she would have been overly concerned about giving us what we paid for if they hadn't. Even worse, she didn't bother to take our credit-card number -- or even ask if we wanted to be able to charge \"incidentals\" (they always ask at Best Western). Silly me, I assumed this was because I had already provided the number online and they had it on file. Nope. We went to pay for wireless Internet access (new wrinkle in rip-offs: you're charged PER LAPTOP, but whatever) and we couldn't. The TV-based room-charge system considered us \"cash only\" customers. OK, fine, we'll just call down. The front-desk employee who answered offered a limp apology but didn't seem even slightly surprised at our predicament -- and she said we'd have to march back downstairs to take care of it. Uh, no. I give you my card number, and you write it down. Can't be done, she says. Our entire society is built on giving credit-card numbers over the phone, I point out. To her credit, she let me yell at her for several minutes without hanging up or being rude in return, but her position (or, at least, her managers' position) was beyond outrageous. I went downstairs to see lines at least as long as when we checked in, and so I went to the VIP window, and, to their credit, they did allow me to do my business there, even though I'm the kind of low-life non-VIP who looks like a \"cash only\" customer and berates innocent employees. Did I mention that the check-in clerk also didn't ask us about bed preferences? Yep. Two doubles for a married couple instead of one king. Maybe they were out of king rooms, but they could have at least said something. (Quality Inn would have.) There were other things -- a burned-out lightbulb, and the valet staff's refusal to get our car until we showed up downstairs to wait for it -- but the check-in debacle was the main thing, and an inexcusable thing for an upscale hotel. The pool was nice, but even that was a little disappointing. (I expected sand, not concrete, and more than one wave per minute.) We'll be back for the dining, I'm sure, but not for the lodging."

If you want a little calm, and want to relax a little, this is the hotel for you - but you pay for it. My wife and I are in our 30's so we didn't want to spend much time at the hotel, but wanted to walk the Strip, go to Freemont St, etc. If you've been to Vegas before and aren't going to go all over the place seeing the sights, then this hotel is for you. If you're going to pack in as much as possible, I say keep the extra $100+ per night and stay next door at the Luxor."

I was exhausted!!!!!!. The hotel is a mob scene on Friday through the weekend. Luggage carts of beer are toted in by the late20-30's crowd. I stayed @ Boulder Station off the strip this past October, the room there was just as large as Mandalay Bay, cleaner, quieter and less expensive. I guess @ my age I do not need the glossy, flashy ambience of a strip hotel. It was nice though that Mandalay Bay was so close to the aiport, it's best feature in my opinion!"

Checkin in line went quickly but received a room that had a \"half-view\" of strip- really meant a view of nothing. I asked to switch 5 minutes later and the supervisor said she couldn't switch us until the next day, after some coercion she switched us to a room with a view of the strip.... room was very nice, A/C is not that strong, but definitetly sufficient. Clean room. We loved the beach, it was certainly crowded on the weekend days but we were able to find beach chairs every day we were there- most people come and go between pools. Enjoyed the wave pool very much. Didn't go in the pools, but the lazy river was fun. You have to buy a tube though ($10 each) which is pricey I thought BUT most people end up leaving their tubes around and at the end of the day you can probably score a few. We ate dinner at the Buffet which was very good, around $23ish dollars per person, sunday brunch as well. The rest of our dining was at other hotels/etc. For a cheaper night, we ate at the Harley Davidson BBQ down the strip which was Excellent. The tram is useful and connects Mandalay Bay with Luxor and Excalibur, it supposedly runs 24hrs a day but was closed 2 days we were there. The casino is very nice, tons of slot machines etc. Went on a bus tour of the Grand Canyon/ Hoover Dam... It was a looong day because the drive out there is a good 4 hours, overall a good experience nontheless. I would definitely go back to Mandalay Bay, the hotel is top-notch, and very clean."

    "content": "My husband and I stayed at Mandalay for a week, including the Memorial Day weekend. The front desk person was very nice, and said that if we wanted to change rooms after the holiday weekend when the hotel was less crowded, we were welcome to do so. We kept our room since it overlooked the pool and it's usually a hassle to move once you've upacked everything. The plumbing fixtures need to be maintained, however, since one of the sink faucets kept dripping and the toilet handle came off a couple of times. The light in the bathroom went out but I left a note when we went out for the day and it was fixed when we came back. The pool area was very crowded, but that seems to be the case with most of the Vegas hotels. We did not have a problem since we got to the pool by 8:30 every morning. My complaint was that they only gave one towel to every person. That's pretty cheap! You need one towel to lay on and one to dry off with (or to cover up with considering the sun is so strong!) Also, as my husband said, on the weekends the wave pool area looked like Club Med. It's definitely a pick-up place, with packs of young girls and guys all trying to connect. We had breakfast at the buffet every morning and enjoyed the food and the service. I find Mandalay to be less generous with the comps earned while gambling than some of the other hotels. All in all, I found the very small negatives to not weigh much in the scheme of things and we would definitely stay here again."

    "content": "After hearing how wonderful the Mandaly Bay was from multiple sources we (4 adults) could not wait to stay here.. Unfortunately we were extremely dissappointed with our stay. The grounds are beautiful, its not as smokey as some casinos, and the pool is nice. Here ends the praise of the hotel. I will try to sum up our disappointments below. The customer service is nothing spectacular - either abrupt comments or lack of customer service via absence. Rooms were dirty with mildew and mold around caulking in the shower and toothpaste residue since intitial opening of establishment all over the sink faucets. The pipes would gurgle each night and at one point spit out black liquid into the sink. The beds and pillows are uncomfortable. The walls are paper thin and one can hear everything from adjoining room - and I mean everything. Good thing we were adults and I didn't have to explain the noises from adjoining room to any children. The doors slam shut loud and one is woken up routinely throughtout the night. You are restricted in temperature of your room as it appears to be on a centralized system. Several times even w/our A/C on high it was still muggy and hot in our room. You also do not have the convenience of turning the fan on high to drown out noise as the fan noise is non existent. Althougth the pool is nice I think they go to extreme in security measures about entry - everyone has to have a key regardless of age. Lastly if you want to utilize any floating device you did not bring with you to the pool you have to buy or rent it. It certainly seems to me after spending the money to stay at one of the \"nicer hotels\" on the strip that the menial pool accessories beyond towels and chairs should be provided. It is a sure bet - we will not be returning."

    "content": "Caveat: This review covers the Memorial Day weekend, 2005. We checked in with virtually no wait (about 11am on Saturday). Very nice staff on the front desk, the woman there upgrading us (for free) from a Deluxe Room to an Executive Suite on a low floor. Room was very nice, very large, very clean. Bed was very comfortable. Only comment about the bathroom was that the jacuzzi is clearly a one-person unit, unless you're very, very small people. Nice for sore backs, not so nice for the romantic rendezvous....we liked the two-person model used in the Monte Carlo's suites better. Only knock on this room was that we had a burned out lightbulb in one lamp, and after leaving notes for housekeeping and calling housekeeping, they never got it fixed in 3 days. This could be due to the fact that it was a holiday weekend and they were going crazy with requests. So, we swapped it with a lamp bulb from another lamp on the other side of the room. Pools were a total joke. Forget swimming or sunbathing on a holiday weekend unless you can get there before dawn. The \"European Style\" pool (read: topless) was $40 for men and $20 for women, and they told you beforehand they had no seats left inside. No thanks, MB. I like this pool, mainly because there are no children allowed (quieter), but I'm not about to pay $40 for the privilege. Beach club should've closed the gate, 'cuz there were no chairs left, no cabanas left (at $200 per day!!!), and the quiet pools were also all filled. Restaurants were pretty much the same scene. MB has no \"food court\", and while I'm usually against food courts, when every restaurant has a long wait or has no reservations left, I'm pretty much in favor of having at least someplace you can just grab something quick. EVERYPLACE was booked Saturday night. Even the buffet had about a 50+ person line. We went to another hotel and ate. Shark Reef was another writeoff. Line was always at least 50-75 people in length. Advice: Don't go to MB on a holiday weekend. Any other time, this is a great hotel."

What we got was a stripped down room without even basic amenities, such as towel racks! Towels were hung on the handrails six feet rom the sink. When we tried to change rooms we were told none were available until the following day, by noon. By 4pm we were still waiting. Staff were extremely rude about facilitating the room change. We though we would forget our cares out at the pool area, but a chip in the concrete in the wave pool kept that attraction closed for 2 hours while we waited. There were no innertubes to rent to float down the \"lazy river\". Finally, check-out time is 11am. When we asked to check out at noon, we were denied. I did not feel like a welcome guest in any way at this hotel. It is not worth the money!"

It's not cheap but very classy and much less hectic than any of the other places on the strip. The Wave Pool, Beach and Lazy River are very nice and quite fun. The Housekeeping staff was very good to us, too. We only ate at 2 of the restaurants: Raffles - a wonderful 24 hour coffee shop which we choose to eat almost every meal at it since it was sooooo good. Not cheap but really good ordinary kind of food like Reuben's, Salads and Breakfasts. We think room service comes out of Raffles' kitchen. As a result the room service food was quite good and delivered in a reasonable time and hot. We also ate 1 meal at Red Square. It was awesome but quite pricey. Recommended nonetheless. We stopped into their niteclub rumjungle one nite and it was really hopping. If you want to visit Vegas but feel like your staying at a much quieter resort....this is the place. In fact, the place is so NOT crowded we're kind of worried they're making a profit. Other luxery places like the Bellagio and Venetian are just crawling with people. If and when we go back we'll stay here again and might never leave the grounds. It's that nice."

The pool area is nice but really crowded and it is difficult to find room no matter what time of day you go. Every (and I mean every) hotel room door slams shut very loudly, so that's all you hear all night and all morning. I know you're not going to Vegas to sleep, but after awhile it gets pretty annoying. The hotel employees were all very nice and courteous so no complaint there. Restaurants are nice but pricey. Maybe this place just wasn't a good fit for us, but I think you can get more value for your money at other hotels.

I'd have to say with out a doubt that for the extra $50-100/ night it is well worth it for their JR suites with the extra space/jacuzzi/private elevators etc. Sports Book at MB is 2nd to none, spa is the best and the nightlife is as good as it gets w/ a lot of variety leaving us entertained year after year. Guys looking to go w/ their wives/girlfriends etc. and want to log some gaming time alone etc. w/ out feeling guilty about it....... this is the place!!! She will have so much to do if she likes the sun/beach/pool/spa/shopping scene etc. The fact that the ladies really dig this place is a big bonus for us guys when it comes to logging hours in the casino. Spend the extra cash where it's important when you visit Vegas such as the hotel you choose and room type etc. and & you will be rewarded time after time, trust me on this. To the ladies reading this I'm sure I sound like a pig but I'm really not. My wife has the time of her life every year at MB and looks forward to booking for the following year on our return home each time so I cant be all that bad. Dining options are endless at MB as well, you will not starve but you will spend some money. This place is by know means for CHEAP traveler who looks at the price immediately after reading each entree description. Youre not getting something for nothing here. You will pay for everything and spend more than you would if you were staying at the Silverton, Binions or the Westward Ho. This is Vegas and you are gonna drop some serious coin, accept it and enjoy it for the experience that it is. There are no handouts and there are no freebies at MB. Plain and simple you get what you pay for. And by all means, look at a Vegas strip map and realize you are at the south end of the strip before booking if location is that important to you. If $15-25 tables are too steep, check out Excalibur and Luxor w/ in a 5 minute walk indoors for $5 tables, they always have em. Feel free to email me w/ any questions. Tom"

The pool area was filthy - empty used cups, wrappers, dishes, cigarette butts all over the concrete pool deck. There's a waitress every two feet offering you a drink or a snack - which is great - but they should make a close to equal investment in cleaning up after all the customers - or at least putting some trash cans where people can use them. They also shouldn't charge you $20 for a inner tube - you're already paying to be at the hotel - inner tubes should be gratis. Room service meals were left in the hallway for hours - not 2 hours - more like 8 hours. If they are going to force you to use room service by not even putting mini-bars in the rooms (which I understand, it is VEGAS) they should clear away people's garbage - for $200/night I don't think I should have to walk past the same rotting meals 3 times a day. There's also no reason to have to stand in line for almost 30 mintues at check in and check out - even if you use \"quick check out\" you still have to stand in line for 30 mintues to check your bags with the bellman."

We weren't disappointed. We only had a standard room, but it was still very nicely appointed. We looked at the pyramid of the Luxor and up the strip. The resort is beautiful. We sampled several of the eateries and found the Raffles Cafe to be very good and farily reasonable. My husband had the best ribs here. Although it is at the south end of the strip, we used the 3-hotel Tram (Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibar) to move around. From the Excalibar you can cross the street to the MGM Grand and catch the Las Vegas monorail further up the strip or you can catch another tram at the Monte Carlo that runs to the Bellagio. The gambling at the Mandalay Bay was not so hot for us. I guess we picked the wrong slots-too tight! The Excalibar had looser slots. All in all a very nice stay in a very beautiful resort."

    "content": "We definitely loved parts of MB - service was outstanding, decor was lovely, fresh filtered air in hotel and casino and the bathroom in our standard room was very nice (see pics). But given the opportunity to come back to Vegas we would not stay here again. Why? Location for one. We were here as part of a trade show for my husband's job so had no choice this time (and yes didn't have to pay either. Next time on our own money, I'll go elsewhere). Unless you really like being at the end of the strip and having to plan to get everywhere (except maybe Luxor and Excal) it gets very annoying. Our room itself was plain and not well-equipped, especially for a hotel catering to the convention crowd. No desk, just an awkward height table. The easy chair was not all that comfortable. Poor soundproofing, could hear neighbor's cell phone in the morning. Nice closets with safe. Beds were comfortable but pillows were the crappy foam that we hate. A request to housekeeping got us slightly better pillows (see above for great service!). We did like the buffet at MB ($21.95) with the huge windows and views of the gardens, fresh food and delicious desserts. However unless you're already near the resort, its not really worth a special trip with all the other great options in town. The only budget eatery options are over by the Shark Reef attraction near the convention center. The pool complex is famous and for the most part we enjoyed it. However we were there in a slow time and I can see how packed it would get when the hotel gets busier. The wave pool is pretty tame- one small wave every couple of minutes or so. The lazy river is nice, but again would get very packed quickly. Several other \"regular\" pools and jacuzzi's help ease the crowds also. The servers were very friendly, try the non-alcoholic fruit punch, delicious! Can't review the casino other than to say that it's spacious and non-smoky. We don't gamble much so can't rate the games. Overall, we think MB can\u2019t decide whether it wants to cater to the hip young beach crowd, the conventioneers possibly with families or the luxury resort crowd. Right now they\u2019re trying for it all and we feel not completely hitting the mark for anyone."

Romantic getaway, sightseeing meca, gaming, first class dining, shopping... The Mandalay Bay has it all. The rooms are spacious and all have a view of something. Our first room had a view of the airport and the front driveway area with it's beautiful lost world setting, fountains and greenery. Our second room had a birds-eye view of the pool areas. The rooms have a separate oversized tub for soaking after a long day in the convention center. The shower is good-sized too. Plenty of room for two people to get ready for a night on the town. The hotel employees were very friendly and helpful. It was no problem to store our luggage between check-out and our flight. We were also able to use the pool area after checking out, but you need the room key to prove you are a guest. The casino is very nice. Not too smokey or loud. Bring comfortable shoes. You will need them, as this hotel is at the very end of the strip. There is free tram service to the corner of Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd., but you will still have to do substantial walking to get to any of the other attractions (ie. the Bellagio fountains, Ceasars, Venician, etc.). Bring lots of money for food. I paid $8 for a hamburger at the food court in the Convention Center area. The breakfast buffet is reasonable and very good, but all of the restaurants were very exclusive and expensive. We did not have a bad meal, but we paid dearly for every meal. The pool area is top notch! The hours are limited (open only until 5pm!). The area is very nicely done with lots of quiet areas, a lazy river, wave pool and a very nice pool. The spa/fitness area is beautiful. It is a hefty fee, but you can enjoy the amenities for the entire day. The services were nothing extra-ordinary, but pretty reasonable for a resort. We will stay at the Mandalay Bay again the next time we go to Las Vegas. I am not sure it is a casino for the hardcore gambler, but for a casual gambler and hardcore people watcher it is the place to be!"

Mandalay Bay was nice but not all that it was cracked up to be. The pools were awesome. The wave pool and beach were both breath taking. The food was average at the buffet...for $2.00 more per person you can get an awesome buffet at the Bellagio. The food at the Mexican restaurant was below average and rather pricey. I stayed at Mandalay Bay because I had a convention there. I would not stay at Mandalay Bay again unless I was there for a convention at their convention center. The hotel room was very dusty and the carpet was worn. I am not high class looking for a mansion, but for $300.00 + per night I expect the room to be dusted and the carpet to look fairly new. The closet space was great, which is good considering the doors were broken on the dresser/tv stand and difficult to open and close. The valet was very slow when bringing the car back. We had to wait almost every time we brought the car back because the valet had no where to put more cars. The valet was very fast at bringing your car to you though. The convention center was excellent, and all the seminars, class rooms etc were immaculate."

There is a nice meeting bar in the middle of the casino, so if you are losing a bunch of $$ and want to relax, you can meet a lady or two there....

The pool is a total zoo now and it's impossible to get a chair. If you are lucky enough to find one, you are crowded up next to tatoo girl and gold chain guy with beer bongs. No one is cleaning up the pool area and there is trash everywhere!!! When I went into the pool, I put my watch next to my shoes and it was gone within ten minutes. Security took half hour and wouldn't do anything. I mentioned the fact that they have cameras everywhere, why not look at the video and see who took it since guest are the only people allowed in the pool area, but they refused. You can bet if someone steals $10 from the casino, the swat team will come out. Unfortunately that lack of care for the guest and protect the profits of the casino mentaltiy resonates in every aspect of the mandalay bay resort. The rooms are basic and include the bare minimum.

    "content": "I stayed here with a few friends in early November of '04. While the property has its clear benefits and things going for it, it is nowhere worth the prices they are charging. First, the compliments: the room was spacious and well-cared for. Housekeeping was top-notch, and the beach-like pool complex is simply wonderful. Plenty of nightlife and dining options on the property, too. Now, the complaints: upon check-in, we discovered that our room safe was broken. We had to wait nearly two hours for maintenence to come and fix it, only to have it break down again an hour later. They make it very clear that they wash their hands of any valuables stolen from your room -- all well and good, but then they need to do a better job of making sure their in-room safes are functioning and are serviced regularly. Secondly, the lack of any low-priced food on the property is inexcusable. $10 for a bagel and a ten-ounce bottle of generic orange juice from the coffee bar (the cheapest prices in the entire resort) is simply highway robbery, especially when I can get the same breakfast for less than half that in midtown Manhattan a few weeks later. Third, on football weekends, I have no idea why they insist on giving up half the sports book area to horse racing, when there were only two or three people betting on those races, while hundreds of people angled for seats and betting slips on the football side, and many were forced to stand in the back. Finally, Mandalay's comp. policy is *terribly stingy.* We avoided the casino after our first night, when my buddies and I spent upwards of 90 minutes at a $25 blackjack table without one round of comp drinks. When a waitress was finally summoned, my friend was scolded when he asked for an imported beer by the waitress, as if he was trying to rip the place off. Our group probably had $2,500 in chips on the table at that moment for a *single hand*, and Mandalay can't comp my buddy a Guinness? Come on. No other property had this issue, high-end or low-end, just Mandalay. I'm sure casinos have to deal with rubes trying to take advantage of them all the time, but you don't take it out on your own guests who are pouring thousands of dollars into your nightly take. We'll be staying elsewhere on our next trip to Vegas, needless to say."

I had previously stayed at THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay so I was familiar with the common areas of the resort. Overall, I'd classify this stay as mundane. We checked in early and had no problems. In fact, I appreciated that the desk clerk asked for ID since there was a deposit on the room. She made no assumptions about bedding, instead asking if we wanted two beds or one. I was travelling with my mother, but I found it great that no assumptions about our relationship were made by the clerk. The room was nice, but not remarkable. I had been spoiled by the suites at THE Hotel. The room was sparse, with only two beds, an armiore, and a working desk. Since the room was so large (a plus), it could have accomodated an easy chair. Or, perhaps a mini-bar could be added. The bathroom was very large, with both a tub and glass-enclosed shower. We had problems with the toilet and had to call twice to get it fixed. That was very annoying. Housekeeping was unobtrusive and generous in restocking the high-quality bath supplies. Food service at Raffles Cafe was adequate but nothing to rave about. The server was low-key and a bit slow. I tried to overnight a package at the Business Center. I was told that I had missed the cut-off time for Fed Ex. (Being from the East Coast I'm not used to a 2:30pm pick-up.) The Concierge suggested I drive to the facility at the airport. I've travelled all over the world and a true Concierge would have offered to make arrangements to have the package taken to the airport, in my opinion. Overall, I feel the Mandalay Bay is lucky to have a 4 Diamond rating by AAA. I have worked in the hospitality industry for over 15 years. I am demanding but I also know what to expect. The service was mediocre and I'd be hard pressed to recommend the resort. From my research, Mandalay Bay's rates are similiar to other large strip properties. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay but I doubt I'll rebook at the original Mandalay Resort."

I was really looking forward to staying there based on the reputation I'd heard over the last few years. The event and conference facility were tremendous, and the casino was top-notch even though I lost! The common areas of the hotel are gorgeous and it's hard to find fault with the facility itself. My room was acceptable, but was twice the price of what my friend staying at the Luxor paid for a room of similar quality. The staff's hospitality index could definitely be improved. I had the impression that they didn't care if I came back. Their attitude imade me think that this is Vegas, and if you're not here then someone else will take your place. Getting to and from other hotels on this end of the strip is harder than by Paris, Bellagio, and Bally's. Everywhere I went seemed seemed to suffer from \"No good way to get from here to there.\" Having said all this, I don't \"hate\" the Mandalay, but will probably stay at hotels at the other end of the strip when I return."

The pool area is just gorgeous, we were disappointed that it was too cold to go into it. Many fine restauraunts. It was very convenient to have the tram that took you to the Luxor and Excaliber. My only complaint was that they didn't sell individual post card stamps. You had to purchase them in a machine that only sold them by the book! Gee! I just wanted one to sent a postcard to my kids!! You can't go wrong at this place... top notch!"

I found it's more remote location a great advantage in that you're not locked in heavy traffic each time you enter/leave the hotel, there aren't throngs of timeshare touts and porn peddlers outside the door 24/7 and there is a free monorail from inside the hotel to Luxor and Excalibur every 5 mins. We had a room in the Fiji Wing on the 30th floor overlooking the Strip, at a cost of $130/night. Going to bed and getting up each morning to the view from the floor to ceiling window was tremendous. The room was large and very well appointed. The bathroom especially was well appointed with his/hers sinks, bath, shower and seperate toilet. Toiletries were plentiful and luxurious. The in-room safe, seperate lit wardrobes, good hotel info, etc., were useful extras. The hotel had a wonderful choice of restaurants/clubs/bars/lounges covering all ends of the monetary scale, but generally at the higher end. Plenty of shops also to choose from, but these too were mainly on the pricey side. We did not experience any problems with staff, and can only praise their general demeanour and helpfulness. There will always be occasions when you are not treated as you would wish, but people's behaviours are often influenced by how they are treated themselves... Check in/out was quick and there were plently of desks open to cope. We had a wonderful time at MB, and found the whole experience to be first class and memorable."

RumJungle was just as great one night for a couple of cocktails. Aureole was superb. The sushi lounge at night hosted a fab r&b/hip hop group that kept a couple of the guests entertained - we even got dancing! The pool area was empty due to the weather but we braved it one sunny day - great drinks service. Mandalay Place had good shopping too. Held my luggage until departure and was prompt in pick up.

I have been to vegas 8 times in 10 years and usually stay mid strip (caesars,mirage) but this year i thought i would see what the mb was all about.unfortunetly, it is so far away from my central vegas! lovely walk up the strip but 2 or 3 times a day was not my usual holiday!? When we arrived, my double, non smoking room which i booked with my local travel agent \"10\"months before, was a twin smoking room !! i was so disappointed at this. they claimed it was the last room in the hotel !! but we could move to another room in the morning. We were told to check in the morning that this reserved room had not been stolen during the night! Luckily in the morning it had not been stolen. we were then told that it was not ready, came back at 2pm, not ready, 4 pm not ready, 5pm not ready,at this point i blew my top. We've been here 24 hours and we still have not got our room. In fairness to the mb,at that point we were up graded (no charge) to an executive suite on the 30th floor looking out over the strip. Now,this was more like it and i must give the mb, this was the best room i've ever stayed in. But it did take a lot of visits to reception to get this result !! no disrespect to americans, but i can imagine americans coming to the uk and if things are not correct i'm sure they would not take it for 24 hours!!? The rest of the mb is lovely, too big though, too much choice on the restaurant front and 10 out of the 15 restaurant was so dear it was unbelievable and i do not mind paying for quality food. anyway,l ovely time in vegas but will not stay at mb again.....to far out of central strip...also the slots are soooo tight,usually have a couple of $500 jackpots per trip,not a dollar !!!!! never mind,maybe on the next trip in a couple of years time at ceasars or mirage !! or even the new \"wynn\"which looks as though it should be excellent."

The slots and video poker machines in the casino are so tight that you cannot win. The table limits are steep. The restaurants are excellent and expensive. Mamma Mia is a good show.

    "content": "Just returned from a Thursday-Monday (October 14th-18th) stay at Mandalay Bay. I've been to Vegas twice before, having stayed at the NY/NY in a Marquis suite in 2000, and off the strip at the Suncoast in 2003. Had a great time during both of those visits, and each hotel was very different. I'm not ready to splurge on Bellagio just yet (hey, I'm only 25), so I went with Mandalay. I was really nervous about my decision based on all of the negative reviews, so I wanted to post this because we had a great time. Disclaimer: When I go to Vegas I usually spend minimal amounts of time at the resort I'm staying at, because there is just too much to do all over town. I also included info on other things we did. What Wasn't Good at Mandalay Bay: -Tried to call room service at 9am on Saturday morning and never got through. -Went to a concert at House of Blues (HOB) and the security was extremely tight, and drink prices outrageous. $8 for an 8oz cocktail in a plastic cup is really irritating. Drink prices (and sizes)throughout the resort overall were very inconsistent. -Our suite had a door to an adjoining room, and our neighbor was loud and drunk on the telephone at 7am and it sounded like he was in OUR room. -Don't waste your money on slots here. Even Aladdin paid out better. What WAS Good at Mandalay Bay: -Checked in at 4pm on Thursday, and there were no lines, and plenty of reception attendents. We had a honeymoon suite on the 9th floor, and didn't wait for more than 10 seconds for an elevator the entire trip. -Our room was huge, and had tons of soap/shampoo/toiletries as well as salts for the jacuzzi on a daily basis. Our room was always cleaned promptly, even though we didn't head out until 11am, and sometimes stopped back at 1pm. -Coral Reef lounge and sushi bar was open late and had excellent food at 'standard' sushi prices. -Food and service at Border Grill was EXCELLENT and I was sorry I only got to eat there once. -Was able to get reservations at Rumjungle for 7pm on Saturday, that day. We watched table after table get the $40 all you can eat BBQ samplers, and it's a great choice for big groups who can share. Food was very tasty, but very expensive. -Now that the monorail is closed indefinitely, the tram to Luxor and Exaclibur is really worthwhile. -You can access the web from your tv, and they even provide a wireless keyboard/mouse. Ours didn't work at first, but a technician came and fixed it, and it was a great option to have. -Shark Reef had some great displays, and we got there at 10am just as it opened so we could be first through. -While we never went in the pool, we walked through on Saturday and Sunday at noon and there was plenty of room. Maybe the key is to get there early? -Check-out and the bell desk on Monday morning at noon were also a breeze. Other comments about Vegas attractions: -Zumanity was excellent, and the box office accomodated us even when we realized we had tickets for the wrong night. -The matinee of Mystere had 4th row seats available the day of the show, and they've made some changes to it (both acts and music) since I last saw it. -Sat in the poncho section for Blue Man Group at Luxor, and got smacked with banana goo. 6th time seeing the show, 2nd for that venue, and it's still excellent. -Lunch buffet at Aladdin was great. I'm a fan of Bellagio's, but this was on par in my opinion. -Tried out Todai in the Desert Passage. Wasn't expecting much from this sushi buffet, but was impressed with the quality and the selection. -Visited Green Valley Ranch and went to Fado's Irish Pub. Great band on Friday nights, and we had an excellent table server with a unique menu. Check it out if you've got access to a car, and get tired of the pub in NY/NY. -Had sushi and tempura at Hamada's in Luxor. Good food, but not the best value for sure. -Skip the overpriced 'yard' margaritas you'll find next to M&M world. $17.50 for a whole lot of sour sugar isn't fun. Guess that's it! I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who's looking to explore the strip (and gamble elsewhere) while doing some walking and coming home at night to a beautiful hotel. If you aren't interested in leaving the property, then I'd recommend going elsewhere."

Took 20 minutes to get someone up with a key to our new room. A strip view room one story up???? Other then that, the hotel was first class. The suites are great. Did spend one day at the wave pool. Very crowded. Not impressed The problem is people leave their chairs and don't take their towels. So most of the lounges look like they are being used when they are not. The other pool at the beach club was closed. They should definately have a pool that is exclusive to the people staying at leHotel. Had breakfast at their buffet every morning. We thought it was a great value. Cook to order omlettes, fresh fruit, pastries etc. all for $12.99 per person. I pay much more then that at Marriott business hotels. Did not notice the 20 something crowd mentioned on this board. Saw all age groups-toddlers to seniors. Anyway, I would recommend leHotel for those willing and able to pay $200-$400 per night."

    "content": "We stayed at the Mandalay from Thursday, October 7th thru Sunday, October 10th. After reading some of the reviews, some of them seemed overly harsh although I tend to agree that the Mandalay bet limits and restaurant prices are on the higher side for Vegas. First, the food. Raffles cafe for breakfast is nothing special, just the usual Denny's like type of food. Now the Beach grill had decent food and reasonable prices. The waiters were nice, prompt and efficient both times we ate there. Red, White and Blue food was average but the prices were a rip. The beer was $7 and not even draft. (For some reason Mandalay doesn't believe in draft beer) The service was inconsistent. At times the staff went out of there way to be helpful and other times they seemed cold. Since we were in a group we had 2 rooms under different parties. One hotel clerk upgraded my friend to the 33rd floor at no charge while the other clerk gave us a room on the 8th floor saying that was the best they had. We had to come back since the keys they gave us didn't work but they got it right on the second try. As far as the look, I would say the Mandalay has nice rooms with decent strip view and the Casino, Sports Book are pretty nice. The pool is cool also, but as reported by other reviews, very crowded and you need to get there early just to try to get a seat. Overall, it was a decent stay. This my second time (I was there in the first 6 months of the opening), and I noticed a bit of a decline in service. In defense to Mandalay, it seems that they want to project a nice image but either their staff is overworked or understaffed. I would probably come back, but would probably stay at THEhotel @ Mandalay."

Our room was HUGE to say the least and had wonderful views of the 'strip'. Fabulous bathroom (with seperate spa tub for two!!) Being virgin Vegas visitors, i was not sure whether i would think Vegas was as cheesy as it appears. Mandalay Bay has defiantely helped me change my mind. Staff were always more than pleasant but not 'sickly and over the top', the food was good in most restaurants but a bit pricey. The bars were entertaining to say the least (they got better as the night went on....) the casino was welcoming to beginners and we won!! The beach pool was way to cramped on the sunday and the rest of the week other pools were closed which i find disappointing for those staying beyond a weekend. Check in and out was easy and my bill was alot lessthan i expected thanks to a very good exchange rate we have at the moment. all in all a top class hotel at the end of the strip (great place to star exploring). I'd go back in a second and this was not my first choice of hotel (Bellagio was full) but i have no regrets"

We're veteran Vegas travelers, returning yearly -- and generally staying at a different hotel each time -- for business. And perhaps that's the problem. So many raves about Manadaly. Simply, the property is a half-step behind Bellagio and The Venetian. Why? Well the rooms are typical Vegas, although rather stark and all but indistinguishable from the \"other casinos\" (with the exception of a nicely oversized bathroom). Room service takes the proverbial forever. The casino is spotless and attractive, although the variety of slot machines is somewhat lacking. The pools, beach and lazy river are cool, yet vastly undersized for the crowds they attract. Valet was a daily nightmare; ditto for hotel check in (far too few front desk employees). Thumbs up for the restaurants, clubs, lounges, etc., but not enough to salvage our opinion. Mandalay Bay is an upper-tier property; however, there's plenty to improve upon."

The restaurants are pricey, but they were phenomenal (Went to Border Grille and the China Grill). The breakfast buffet was adequate. The bathrooms is this place were amazing - a separate water closet room! It is far from other casinos, but I knew that it would be. There is the tram which is useful, but it is also nice that it is a bit quieter down on the south end of the strip - more secluded. Anyway, the MB clearly caters to those wanting to drop some cash. Even way at the end of the strip, bet minimums are mid-strip values even during slow times. I was particularly frustrated when they had one craps table open at 4am with a minimum bet of $10. No one was at the table!!! Why not lower the minimum if no one is there? And if you have problems with clausterphobia - they would be solved in this casino - this place is very spread out and not cramped at all. The poker room was pleasant, just not the players, some were just too serious about the game and weren't interested in even smiling once. Anyway my wife and I went here because we wanted a bit more sophisticated hotel at less than Bellagio prices. And it does deliver that atmosphere - usually they wouldn't let the likes of us in the place and that's what we wanted - a nicer place. But we both agreed that almost as good of an atmosphere could be found at much cheaper places. Overall, the value is not as good we felt as some other places on the strip. If you want a bit of sophistication and are willing to pay the price - MB is the place for you. However, if you are more interested in value, there are other places that can be had for much cheaper. Save your money for gambing and pricey meals."

Mandalay is at the end of the strip, but if you are looking for a place that won't hit you over the head with their \"Theme,\" then this is it. They have the higest quality restaurants and best selection, the pools are great and the lazy river is fun for kids of all ages. The rooms are comfortable and feel bright and \"breezy\" and the place just smells great when you walk in the door. The first time I stayed at Mandalay was a few weeks after it opened and I can say wholeheartedly that it continues to improve with each visit. Feels like my home away from home. The new THEHotel is also amazing if you prefer a W-like experience. TVs in every room (yes, EVERY room) and plastic cherries in a bowl? Wow."

The hallways were dirty with linens & pillows in the floor for hours. The carpet was really dirty & there's was no rush by the cleaning crew to get to it. The information counter people were not there to help but to just take your money. The valet parking took forever at anytime of the day or night. The food in their restaurants was horrible & expensive. Their casinos were also very dirty. The cocktail girls didn't serve you unless you looked like Bill Gates. Overall this place needs lots of tidy-up. Giving the fact that you will pay a small fortune for a week here. Don't waste your cash on trash with a brand name. Plenty of other good hotels in the strip for a lot less & with better service."

I had booked an ordinary room and all I asked for was the possibility of a good view. We were given an upgrade to a suite on 60th floor which is one of the 3 penthouse floors, but on the condition we did not use the VIP lounge located on that floor. We agreed to this. Oh wow. We had access to 4 elevators which only went to floors 60 - 63 there was never any wait or anyone else in them when we used them. When we got to the suite it was another really big oh wow. We had a huge lounge room with 2 3 seater sofas, coffee table, and large TV there was also a breakfast bar separating a small kitchenette are with sink and fridge. There was also a toilet off the entrance. We then had large double doors taking us into our bedroom very large bed, table and two chairs the room was huge. This led into the bathroom and another wow as it was large had a second toilet, jacuzzi tub big enohgh for two (we tried it) and double vanity, absolutely beautiful. With the jet lag I woke up at 4.30 am on first morning and hit the jacuzzi such a luxurious way to start the day. The icing on the cake was the bvulgari toiletries in bathroom such luxury. There were also in total 8 bath towels, 8 hand towels and 5 face clothes, I have never seen so many towels in one bathroom We ordered room service breakfast quite expensive $38 for continental and half melon filled with fruit, but the experience was worth it. We ate breakfast off the white linen covered trolley gazing at the wonderful view of the pools and the airport. We spent the first day Wednesday getting over the jet lag around the wave pool - it was not crowded and we really enjoyed it. It was different on Friday morning when we used it for a few hours before checking out - it was much more busy, noisy and the crowd were younger (we are early 40s) but it was still a great time and the lazy river is fun even without the tubes. We never did manage to get a drink while playing the slots but only played very low price machines and only for an hour the whole stay. We never ate in the signature restaurants either we just never found the time. On Wednesday we went back to our room at 5.30pm layed on the bed, big mistake we did not wake up and get ready before 11.00pm. We had an early breakfast at 4.30 am at Raffles Place, the 4 egg omelette was so big we couldn't finish it. Wonderful way to end our eveining (or early morning) and head to bed for a few hours. Location was never a problem, quick ride over to Excalibur gave great strip access as well as good access to Luxor and Excalibur. Our overall view. The suite was the best. Clean, comfortable and quiet. The mattress on the bed was perfect. The service to the room was excellent. The elevators were no problem but there were four of them to only the topp 3 floors so that might be the reason we never waited more thant 2 seconds. I loved the beach and the wave pool and young people are not a problem to us we still think we are them. I think the ambiance and service at Mandaly is excellent and would stay there again in a hearbeat even without the upgrade, so much so that when we moved onto the Venetian for our last 5 days I really wished we had stayed at the Mandalay Bay. Nothing wrong with the Venetian just I loved the Mandalay Bay so much I regretted the move. I highly recommend the Mandalay Bay."

    "content": "First of all, we had a great time at Mandalay Bay. You have to go to Vegas with a positive attitude and low expectations, because it isn't a place where service is fabulous, over all. There are just too many people. MB is beautiful, great pool area (no problems finding a chair at all), great spa (went twice), and we thought the place was very well laid out--i.e. you don't have to walk through the casino to get to the pool, spa, or restaurants. I read quite a few of the reviews here in which people said the staff were rude. I never encountered anyone who was rude, but then again, we never really demanded much from them. I get the sense that the employees at these huge Vegas hotels are overwhelmed by the massive hordes of tourists that come in and out every single day. Our room was spacious and comfortable but by no means luxurious. The bathroom was big and pretty, but our shower was leaky and one of the sinks had a very slow drain. We didn't bother to complain because we had already switched rooms (we were initially assigned a smoking room because there was nothing else available when we arrived late Friday night), and we didn't have the energy to switch rooms a second time! Oh, and by the way, when we switched rooms, no one even offered to help us move our luggage. This would never happen at a non-Vegas hotel. The problems we had with Mandalay Bay are problems we have with Las Vegas in general. There are just SO many people there--the city is simply overrun with visitors, and as a result the hotels are all packed. The cab line at the airport to go to the strip was ridiculously long, and this is just how it is all the time, from what I understand. I think the next time we're in Vegas, I would spring for the Four Seasons. That way you have great service and a truly luxurious room, but can take advantage of MB's fantastic pool area (some people complain about the wave pool, but we thought it was fabulous! Great people watching!). I have stayed at the Bellagio and while it is definitely nicer than MB, the service still isn't that attentive. What can you expect from hotels that have a zillion rooms??? I probably wouldn't recommend the MB...I'd try The Hotel or Four Seasons. I like Bellagio a lot, too (have stayed there twice), but the pool area there just can't compare to the \"beach\" at MB. The most important thing when you go to Vegas...keep a positive attitude and open mind, or you will have a miserable time."

Unfortunately, I never reported it. I was on a 3 week cross country trip and didn't even realize that $400 worth of my clothing was stolen out of the luggage in my room until I returned home. I realized that pieces of my wardrobe were missing and then it all fell into place. I had washed my clothes in Phoenix before arriving at Mandalay Bay for a 3 night stay. I knew all my clothing was there and the last hotel I had brought my bags into the room was MB. A friend of mine saw the maid looking at her with a strange expression when she stopped in the room briefly from the pool and the maid was my height (almost 5'11\"). Funny how all my tall woman's clothing was taken. I visit Vegas up to 3 times a year and will NEVER stay at this hotel again. Have never experienced this at any other hotel in Vegas. Beware if you choose this hotel!"

The pool on the Saturday was so packed, it wasn't even enjoyable. A bit better during the week, but on a weekend you'd better plan to be there by 9 am. One of the elevators was constantly not working on our floor, and we waited a long time for an elevator we could fit on at some points. The hotel itself is nice, I would probably stay there again, but I would do anything to not have to deal with the battle at the pool and the crowds throughout the hotel. The pool at the MGM Grand is just as nice, has the river, and was very easy to get a spot. I did find the staff pleasant for the most part, other than one waiter at the pool restaurant who forgot one of our meals, then it came out wrong, and did nothing for us. It is not a big deal to be so far down the strip, if you take the tram to the Excalibur it is easy to get anywhere from there."

We arrived at the hotel at around 10:00 PM on a Friday night because our flight was delayed due to weather. We were exhausted and hungry and had no wait to check in. The attendant was extremely friendly and I asked her for a nice strip view room and she was more than accomodating. We had a room on the 18th floor with an awesome view. I wanted to be a little higher but as soon as I saw that view I knew it would be OK. The room was spotless and was cleaned promptly evey day. We had some amazing food and service at Raffles Cafe but found Red White and Blue to be extremely overrated in service, food quality and price. We also had a fabulous dinner and time at Rumjungle with a very charming and friendly server. (Wish I could remember his name.) We went to the 70's show at the House of Blues on Sat and had a blast. The pool was fabulous and we found it to be not that crowded and we always found chairs right next to the wave pool. Every single staff person we encountered was gracious and friendly and more than happy to help us with whatever we needed. We kept waiting to see all the \"rude\" people that we read about here but never found them. Oh, I almost forgot...the Sunday brunch was pretty good too, as was a late lunch at the Border Grill. We are a touch older than the 20 and 30 somethng's that supposedly hang out there, but never felt out of place. I would stay there again but would splurge for a room at The Hotel next time I think. Overall, the place was great.....but then again, I really think a vacation experience is all in what you make of it."

I wasn't going to wait in a long line again as I did when I checked in. Not at what I paid per night for the privelage of staying in this hotel. I called the number on the bill and was told that they could do nothing 2 weeks later and i should have notified them the day i checked out of the illegitimate charge. I would have had the in room checkout worked you morons. They gave me another number for the accounting department which had 9-5 business hours to make a call. Not a time that is convenient for me to call because of the nature of my job so I said frig it I'll eat it. However, Mandalay Bay don't think I'm going to let you get away with this rip-off. I have made it my mission to put you out of business slowly but surely. Everytime I'm in town you will have a very tough time keeping your public telephone stocked with writing paper and pens. Your toilet paper?, players will not spend time at your tables if they can't wipe their a#$ in the bathroom. You may find it in short supply when I'm in town. This may not sound like much but I guarantee to bleed you dry Mandalay bay and shut your doors by years end 2005. You messed with the wrong guest this time my friends."

Crowded pool,can't ride the small waves it's just silly to try,no flotation devices aloud either, pool closes early,daughter like the lazy river,though. Try to find a tube that's been abandoned. Save you $20.At all means avoid their sports book!!!! I just assumed the odds on football games would be the same at every hotel. It's not. The Hilton sports book was much better. The spreads are the same but the payouts aren't. And it's open until 2am. Shark reef was a ripoff. Bellagio has the best food. I don't know how you can screw up breakfast but The House of Blues did. Watch out for conventions at the hotel. When they take a break you'll wait forever for an elevator. Going to the Grand Canyon? Make sure you get on a tour that vists the south rim not the west rim!"

Probably not a great choice with small kids because there are not themes and amusement parks and arcades etc. for children like there are at Circus, Circus and Treasure Island and Excalibur, etc. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because there are a couple of places we've stayed in other states or countries which we reserve the \"5\" for.

The casino was a blast - the on floor beverage service was the only disappointment - it was impossible to get service in the slot area.

As in any service industry \u2013 you get in return what you dish out! The hotel and casino were busy, even though it was during the week. As long as you come prepared for the crowds \u2013 everything else is easy. These hotels are so huge, they\u2019re like small cities. We visited a couple of other casinos (Luxor, Excalibur, Stratosphere, and Las Vegas Hilton) and none of those are in the same league as the Mandalay Bay. We picked up a hotel map at the information desk in main Mandalay Bay lobby. Bring comfortable shoes \u2013 you\u2019ll do quite a bit of walking. We didn\u2019t mind because we felt we needed it after all the food we were eating. Don\u2019t expect to get off too cheap here. We spent a lot more than I anticipated on food because every restaurant was full service. We ate at the House of Blues, Red White & Blue, Border Grill, Raffles Caf\u00e9, the Buffet, and room service. The food was EXCELLENT but we averaged about $40 - $50 a meal \u2013 and we drink Iced Tea only. I would not normally spend this amount of money on food \u2013 but it\u2019s vacation and it\u2019s delicious!! Other hotels have cheaper food (Luxor, Excalibur, etc) but none of them have the ambiance of the Mandalay Bay. We left a $5 tip every day for housekeeping and made sure we were gone by 2 pm. We always came back to a super clean room. The in-room snacks were expensive, but we had a couple of them anyway \u2013 it\u2019s vacation!! We had a head, back and shoulder massage at TheSpa, followed by a Jacuzzi soak. What luxury!! I highly recommend a treatment of some sort while there. A cab to the airport was about $12 not including tip. A cab from NY, NY to the MB was $6 not including tip. The casinos are set up for cabs \u2013 it\u2019s just as organized as getting a cab at the airport. Very easy!!! We spent $10 each for an all day trolley pass that took us all up and down the strip \u2013 the northern most stop was the Stratosphere. It was a rough ride, and it wasn\u2019t too quick, but it was cheap and we got to see all the casinos at street level. The free tram between MB, Luxor, and the Excalibur was extremely easy if you plan on any activities at these hotels."

We did find another pool further down the path, after a few days, that was very nice and clean, uncrowded and there were attentive waitresses to take orders. Lets see.. check in. We arrived in the late morning with a three hour time difference so we were starving by that time. Check in was not allowed until 12:00. No one at the front desk offered to keep our luggage for us, or direct us to where we could leave it so we ended up hauling it through the casino while we tried to find a place to eat lunch that didnt have a huge line. We finally found the Red White and Blue Cafe. When we approached the hostess she told us that we cant come in until 12:00!! even though there were people eating in there from earlier. So, that was our very first impression of Mandalay Bay. I found the houskeeping staff to be very kind and they did a great job with our room. There is good and bad and I really am kind of neutral about the place. We did go to the House of Blues to see Pat Green,who was awesome I might add. It is a long way to get to the heart of the strip to see the other casinos, so for that reason I have to say that next time we will check out another place."

The band playing for free in the lounge was top-notch, worth paying money to see, and they got the crowd on their feet dancing. In short, we didn't leave the property for three days except to take the monorail to the Luxor. We quickly determined that we wanted to spend all of our time at MB. I would definitely stay there again."

    "content": "My husband stayed at the Mandalay Bay Resort (not the Hotel) from August 26-29, 2004 for a legal conference and I joined him on the 28th. Prior to my arrival he informed me that there was no ice bucket and one of the room lights was broken. He had notified the front desk and housekeeping. The bucket arrived the next day but the light did not get fixed until the second day when I arrived. But those were minor inconveniences. The room was comfortable and tastefully decorated and the bathroom was excellent with a large tub and separate shower. I had stayed here before so I was aware that the rooms were pretty nice. My only comment is stay off the seventh floor because outside the window is an extended partition with a decorative facade that makes this floor the only one without large floor to ceiling windows. Also, because this room was included in a bloc for seminar participants at a slightly reduced rate, they probably divied out the least desirable rooms. The spa was great, highly recommend the hot rock massage. The restaurants Rumjumble had a fantastic Lunch (coconut shrimp Salad) and Georgio had pretty good Italien food but not a large selection. They also allowed us to have a late checkout because the seminar did not get out until 12:15. The musical Mama Mia was fantastic, we had seats second row center. The pools are great but very crowded and it is very difficult to find a seat unless you arrive at dawn. In all we had a great time, would recommend the resort but not the 7th floor. Have fun!!!!"

The rooms were above average, especially the bathrooms. I had one problem (wet spots on the carpet) and when I called the front desk I was moved immediately, to a higher room with a better view. This was my first trip to Las Vegas and when I visited other hotels and came back to Mandalay Bay, I was very happy to be staying there. The wedding chapel was beautiful, and the wedding coordinators are extremely on the ball. My sister's wedding was perfect. I did have a couple of instances when the staff was less than helpful, as other reviewers have pointed out. Not all, but some of them seem to have the feeling that they're doing you a favor in letting you stay there. I never had a problem with the elevators like some people have. Five minutes was probably the most I had to wait the whole time I was there. The buffet was ok, nothing spectacular. You will be nickeled and dimed to death, so be prepared! I suspect it's like that at most hotels in Las Vegas, though. From the $5 bottles of Aquafina in the rooms to the $15 they charge to print out a boarding pass, it adds up. The pool was a lot of fun. We spent some time there just about every day. If you eat at the poolside bar and grill, get the Tex-Mex salad and share it. It's HUGE, healthy, inexpensive, and delicious. If you're thinking about staying at Mandalay Bay, check the website and join the Paradise Club before you book your room. You'll get e-mail offers for big discounts. Good luck and have fun in Las Vegas!"

The sound means, \"Please Be Rude To Us.\" Honestly, I see other people enjoying this place, and I know from reading the other reviews that people love staying here and playing in the casino. We're pretty laid back, and we really, really want to like this place. Every time we go there, we keep an open mind, hoping that they will redeem themselves. Every time we leave, we wonder what possessed us to walk all the way over there from the middle of the strip. Bottom line: I'm beginning to really suspect that my husband's theory is right. My advice: If you go to Mandalay Bay and the first few people that greet you don't smile, or have a nasty retort when you sweetly ask for a drink at the bar, get yourself checked out for the high pitched noise, and move directly to another hotel. The Bellagio, Westin and Venetian staff either don't hear the high pitched noise or it translates to them as, \"Be nice to these people, they are friendly.\""

The next morning we moved to a V Suite as originally planned. THEcafe was excellent for breakfast and there was a coffee bar open as well. I don't believe the rooftop resturant is open yet. The walk to the pool is soooo long I thought I was lost. I had asked in the casino for a cabana due to the reviews of the crowded pool. It was quite full, but I didn't find the cabana to be all that wonderfull. Nothing like the cabanas at Bellagio. Overall, it was a nice place to stay, and the beds were very comfortable, but I do not think I would return. The south strip location is quite far. Next year it will be Wynn LV all the way!"

The food great, the room service prompt but you need to know that they charge a $5.00 call fee for the person who picks up the phone to take your order. Was kinda taken a back by that. But the food was great. The pool. Yikes. It was full of unsupervised childern running wild and free, empty food and soda containers lying around, dirty towels and other miscellaneous debris scattered throughout. The chairs are crammed tightly together so you best like people because they are almost on top of you.

A big step up from the Flamingo hilton where I stayed last time. I really like that end of the strip. There are plenty of options with the MGM and NY,NY just a tram ride away.

    "content": "First the NEGATIVES. Las Vegas and every hotel including this one and every casino and restaurant is a SMOKER's PARADISE. There was smoking in the line to leave your luggage with the bellhop, there was smoking in the hallways and in front of the elevators, there was smoking everywhere. Casino smoke drifted into all of the restaurants that were in the casino unless you were seated at the opposite end far away from the casino, then you were usually right next to the restaurant's smoking section as was in Raffles. CHECK-IN was a nightmare. It was an hour to get checked in and there were only four people in line in front of us. There were at least 12 lines. Here's a suggestion: Instead of telling everyone to come back at 12 noon to check in, let guests register and pay for the room, then just have them stop back to pick up the keys at noon in stead of repeating the whole process. The MAID SERVICE was surprisingly slow, there were many opportunities for the maids to service the room, yet we waited till 5 most days for it to be done. Next, the POSITIVES. This was the most beautiful and clean hotel with the friedliest staff. The VIEW rom our room on the 29th floor was so awesome and the floor to ceiling, wall to wall, windows provided a night time view of the strip that was actually breathtaking. The Bathroom was elegant with the marble, and the glass shower. The FOOD at the Mandalay's restaurants was incredible and we ate at the Bayside buffet three times, twice for lunch and then for dinner which was disappointing because for an additional $10, they only put out crab legs and prme rib in addition to what was already out, and very fabulous, at lunch. We dined at Raffles, House of Blues, Red White and Blue, the Burger Bar in Mandalay Place (awesome and new) and had the best experience at the Red Square. The russian restaurant was so in theme, you would certainly believe that you were dining in the Old Country. The waitstaff was courteous and professional yet we still felt casually comfortable. I would rate the food and service A+. Try the Filet Mignon and the Stroganoff. The WAVE POOL was the best. Of course you had to go out past where the waves were breaking and crashing, at he 3 foot area, because that's where all the little kids were. But out in the 5 foot area, there was plenty of room and it really felt like you were in the ocean, with the rolling surges and swells of the waves. I dont know why some people complain that the waves came too slow, they come every two or three minutes. IT was the best. It was a little tough to get a spot on the beach but there were plenty of chairs. The food at the pool grill was terrific too. The portions everywhere were huge, no wonder America is so fat. As far as shows, we went to the LUXOR's Midnight Fantasy which was a topless dance show and for $35 I think it was the best bargain in Vegas. The girls were fabulous and beautiful. the comedian had us in tears from laughing and overall was a really fun show. Definitely go see it to get a true taste of Vegas. If it werent for all the smoking it would be the perfect vacation spot."

We moved ourselves, 4 or 5 star will automatically send someone to help. Finally got a working room and even had view. Beach pool had plastic cups floating everywhere, on the beach, just downright dirty, chairs everywhere. In smaller pool we were there about 9:30am and found cups and even gum floating in the pool as lifeguards just looked on. This is supposed to be a 4 or 5 star hotel! I would FIRE the pool manager. Also front desk staff were not very friendly. In addition I was told \"no\" 8 times during my stay and 2 \"yes we can\". Someone should tell this hotel GM the customer is king! As for the casino. Go somewhere else. They only wanted to honor my \"one card\" for slots. No table games without me fighting with them. I got No Comps, nothing and played several thousands during the first few days. Then I wised up and went elsewhere. You would think they would treat a hotel guest somewhat better. All in all, the rooms were nice, but overall this is a totally overrated hotel. I have also sent the VP of Cust. Relations a letter since their website does not take comments. I can't wait to see if they respond. By the way this hotel is being taken over by the MGM. Maybe things will get better. THE Hotel does not know how to treat guests. Please go somewhere else if your looking for the 4 or 5 star experiance. Ate at 3 resturants there. Very expensive. Ready for this, one resturant, Red & White, I had to send my coffee back 3 times. Each time the waiter brought me back curdled cream. He kept saying. I just opened up a new one. Wow, they must all be bad. Must be the Vegas heat. But he was very nice about it. Also, no coffee makers in the room. They want you to buy everything however in that aspect that's the way of the others on the strip. The only way I will return is if Management address's my comments and tells me how they are fixing things. I doubt it because these hotels are huge and they really don't care when it comes down to it becasue for every bad customer experiance, there is a good one."

    "content": "This was my fourth trip to Vegas and my first time staying at Mandalay Bay. Usually we stay at Paris, but my parents recommended Mandalay, so we gave it a try. The best thing about Mandalay Bay is that it's VERY full service. It's a huge complex with tons of gaming, a number of quality restaurants, varied and fun bars/clubs/lounges, good shopping, nice rooms, and a fantastic pool. However, being so far off the strip, they've got to offer a full service experience. However, with the tram to Luxor and Excalibur and then the monorail not too far from Excalibur (you have to cut through Excalibur, New York, New York, and MGM to get there), it's becoming more connected to the rest of the city. Besides, Vegas has almost as many taxis as it does slot machines. If you aren't a high-roller, don't worry -- every time I've been there, $5 tables have been common during the day and $10 tables can be found at night. My wife and a friend had a blast playing penny slots, so her fear of losing too much money wasn't a factor. The restaurant choices are great here. House of Blues is a fun club, but also serves up tasty New Orleans-inspired bistro fare. I've got to agree with some of the other reviewers' comments that the service at Raffles is a bit slow, but the food was always a notch above the rest, so it's worth it. We weren't really impressed with Wolfgang Puck's Lupo, but then again, we're from New Jersey, where great Italian food is pretty easy to find. It should be noted that we were also there during the filming of NBC's 'Las Vegas'. It's pretty surreal to stumble onto an open set in the lobby at 6am, but the crew was very nice and understanding. They film at odd hours to minimize any inconvenience, but the shooting at the pool closed off one entire area, making it impossible to get a chair as early as 9:30 in the morning. Then again, you get to stand there and watch a TV show being made, so it's not all bad. I'd definitely recommend Mandalay to anyone thinking about staying there."

    "content": "I just came back from a three-day midweek stay at Mandalay Bay. It was my third trip to Vegas, having stayed at Luxor and the Venetian on my prior trips. I was a bit disappointed when I stepped into my room (which was in the older hotel, not the new THEhotel which is obviously very swank). The room was a standard size and had standard furnishings, but nothing special. The bathroom was certainly nicer than average, with lots of marble, a separate bath and shower, and more bathroom products than most places, such as bath oil beads and interesting shampoos and soaps. It seemed to me that attention to detail was not one of Mandalay Bay's strong suits, as there were numerous little annoyances such as a carpet that needed shampooing and two lamps without working lightbulbs. One recommendation I would make is that you ask for a room that is reasonably close to the elevator, as the hallways are long, and that you avoid a room high in the tower, as you will end up having to stop on every floor on the elevator up or down. If you feel strongly about a king size bed vs. two full or queen size beds, do make a point of it at the front desk as you cannot assume that you will be given the type of room you reserved--I wasn't. Though the room is nothing special as I said, the rest of Mandalay Bay's facilities are. First of all, the \"Beach\", which includes a wave pool and lazy river, is simply spectacular and great fun--but be warned that it gets crowded and you may need to be aggressive to find yourself a chair. I think Mandalay Bay could keep this area open it a bit later as well, as it closed at 7 pm, and I know some of the neighboring properties kept their pool areas open until at least 8 pm. The casino is huge and one of the nicest in Las Vegas, and the new Mandalay Place mall is gorgeous as well. Finally, there is an impressive group of restaurants and bars. As far as the restaurants, bars and shops go, I think that Mandalay Bay tries to target a somewhat younger, \"hip\" crowd with a fair amount of money to spend, so if you are looking for a hip/swank/stylish but not stuffy kind of environment, then Mandalay Bay is the place for you. I was also impressed with Mandalay Bay's room service--food was good and they came promptly when they said they would."

    "content": "I visit Las Vegas about 4 times a year and so I like to check out all the properties. While Mandalay Bay is lovely, it wasn't spectacular and sometimes down right disapointing. Check in took forever with rude and uncaring staff. We had a reservation for a non-smoking king room, and when we got there we were told that we would either have to settle for a smoking room or a double. I was not happy at all. I'm very firm about having a non-smoking room and my mate is much too tall to fit comfortably on anything less than a king. The check in staff suggested we upgrade to a suite at $50 additional a night, and waffled back and forth between claiming we had no reservation ( I held a print out of it in my hand) to saying they were just completly booked. After some haggling we finally got a king bed, albiet in a smoking room. The room wasn't anything special and it seemed so shabby and old for a fairly new property. The bathroom was nice except for a leaky toilet which they never fixed or offered to move us. The pool area is nice, but very crowded and the wave pool is absolutely no fun at all. They don't allow you do bodysurf (not that the waves are big enough to do such a thing) and restrict you to a limited area in the pool to just kind of stand around ( you aren't allowed to swim or do much moving). The restaurants are great and the Shark Reef is okay if you are bored and have nothing better to do. Overall I would not stay here again unless I had a comp or everywhere else was booked."

You could not smell the smoke at all from other floors or the casino. TV's were flat screen! They have internet TV which was great to keep in touch with everyone back home.

    "content": "I stayed at Mandalay Bay with my three kids ages 17, 15, and 13. We got what we thought was a good deal on the hotel ($101/night). When we went to check-in, however, we were told that we would be charged an additional $60 per night ($30 for the third and fourth person in the room). I argued because that was never told to me when I made the reservation (I had done it over the phone) and I had even told the reservation agent that I would have four people in the room. The manager was called in and he agreed to wave the fee for the first night, but we had to pay it for the rest of the stay. Then we arrived at room. As we walked in, we noticed that the beds had not yet been made. The room was clean, but there were no sheets, pillows, or comforters on the bed. We called housekeeping and after visits from four different people, they finally made the beds for us. A couple of days later we once again had problems with housekeeping. The maid had come at 7:30 that morning because we forgot to put out our \"do not disturb\" sign. We politely asked her to come back in a few hours after we had gone out to the pool. She did not speak good English, but we thought that she understood. When we came back from the pool at 3:00, the room was still not cleaned. We called housekeeping and we were told that they could not send anyone to clean our room because it was past service hours and we were responsible for calling and arranging our own cleaning time. I argued and finally they said that they would come to clean our room. We left for dinner and a show and came home around midnight and surprise, surprise, our room still was not clean. I called housekeeping, was basically yelled at by the guy, and finally someone was sent up to clean our room at 1:00 in the morning. When we complained about our housekeeping services at check-out, the agent was very kind, took down our number, and a few days later I received an apology letter from the housekeeping manager. Besides the whole housekeeping fiasco, we had a wonderful stay. The pool was great- the kids loved the wave pool and the lazy river and I was able to relax at one of the quiet side pools. It was a little too crowded for my taste, but so are all the Vegas hotels. The room was beautiful and above average in size. The bathrooms were great and very spacious. Besides housekeeping, the staff was very nice and courtious. Although Mandalay Bay is a little off the strip, they offer a monorail to the Luxor and Excalibur which worked out really nice (it saved a lot of cab fare!). Overall, our stay was very nice, but I wouldn't pay full price ($200-300/night) to stay there again."

(oh yes The lazy river! its that full you have to fight for your life not to be thrust infront of the person 2 inches in front of you. Nice idea though!) On the plus sides, the room was very nice with great views over the strip. The hotel is very nice, the pools are nice but on the whole the place is just too busy, not what you want for a relaxing holiday. Oh and they could do with a food court so you can pick and choose what you want to eat"

I cannot explain to you what she did to me with those heavenly hands. I swimmed in the nude in their jacuzzi. It was deliciously relaxing and invigorating.

    "content": "Either this place is ridiculously overated, or I guess we were there on an off week, but our stay at Mandalay Bay was far from 4 or 5 stars. The suite that we had was in the original hotel, not THEhotel, as we were told it would be. This suite is nothing special, in fact, the airport suite at the Wyndham that we stayed in in Newark the night before was far nicer and half the price. We actually had reserved two suites that were supposed to be connecting (we were travelling with children) and when we arrived at MB they told us the suites weren't connecting. That was a problem that they fixed by giving us a connecting suite and deluxe room. Next big problem: The pool area lost all power for 1 1/2 days of our trip (the pool was the entire reason we chose MB) and the hotel wouldn't even give us free passes to the Shark Reef to pass some time. They stated: \"the pool is an amenity, you pay for your room, and you aren't entitled to anything more than that. The rest is extra.\" Well. When the pool finally did begin operating again, it was so crowded, full of drunk, obnoxious singles, totally crowding the kids pool area. What the Travel Channel doesn't tell you is that if you are under 48 inches tall, you aren't allowed in the wave pool (so no small children, not even carried by parents), and that you have to RENT a tube for the lazy river at $20 per person a day. You'd think that the $300 a night hotel room would include a tube, if not the Shark Reef admission. We couldn't even stay at the main pool after 1 pm on Friday and the rest of the weekend because of the inappropriate behavior, attire, and discussions there, with our two children ages 3 and 5. I couldn't even go get a drink alone because of all the heckling and ogling. I was walking my 3 year old daughter and some guy actually yelled out, \"Show me your nipples and I'll buy you a beer!\" After that, we moved up to the South Lagoon pool which was better. Housekeeping stunk at this hotel big time. One night we ordered Domino's pizza and they didn't even clear the pizza boxes the next day, just left them on the table. Never picked up things like gum wrappers, just left them on the vanity, I guess they wiped around them, if they wiped at all. The room was so hot, it was like the air conditioner wasn't working. The hotel said it was working fine. My daughter got a heat rash under her chin, and the hotel didn't have any fans. We took a $40 cab ride to Walmart to buy a fan for the rest of the trip so we could all sleep. Yes, we were terribly disappointed with our room and the hotel. We tried to voice our complaints but no one seemed interested---one staffer suggested we move to Circus Circus, since we had children, like we weren't welcome at MB. We strolled through 15 other hotels that week, to see what they were like and visit the attractions there, and practically every one was \"cooler\" than MB, either had a theme, or a real \"feel\" to it. MB has big waterfalls and rocks, and that's about it. Big deal. We live near Atlantic City and the Borgata is by far a classier, nicer, better appointed hotel, with people to match. Please don't think I'm some loser who never goes anywhere---we travel high class alot, just this year we've been on a cruise, we've been to Disney, and we've been to Hawaii and have gone first class all the way. This hotel was definitely not first class, at least not the week we were there. If you are 24, single and looking to hook up, and half drunk, then this is the time of your life. If you are mid thirties, married with kids, and looking for a classy, comfortable, and relaxing time, don't bother. Go to the Venetian, or MGM, or New York New York. (The Bellagio doesn't allow kids). Mandalay Bay is not all it's cracked up to be."

We weren't even allowed inside because we only had ONE room key with us, and the Bay requires each guest (including the toddlers in the family next to us) to have a key. What a rediculous policy! The pool was crowded and totally overrated. It was nice, but really not the best in town (Flamingo has the best pool in our travels). The place really is too far away from other hotels. We knew this going in, but it did bother us somewhat. We took the monorail to Excalibur then walked, but going to places like the Mirage....that's a long walk! For the price we payed, which was a good deal at 100$, we feel we got better values at the Flamingo and Monte Carlo. We have stayed at those places along with the Mirage, Luxor, and Aladdin and the Mandalay Bay was our least favorite place."

It is not too far to walk to the pool, nor did we have any problems finding chairs to sit on. The room was one of the best, and we had just stayed the two previous nights at the Venetian. It is probably one of the best suites on the strip as far as luxuries and comfort. Would definately stay again if the rate is reasonable. We paid about $179 per night and felt it was a fair amount to pay. The plasma tv's were great. There is one in the living and bedroom. Also a small one in the bathroom. The battery in the remote of the bath's plasma didn't work. I called for another battery which never came, but just used one of the other remotes and it worked fine. It was no big deal, and we were not upset. The bathtub was awesome and the shower products were much better than at the Venetian. Overall an excellent hotel and would stay at again. I frequently stay at many top notch hotels and this one definately deserves to be a 5 star."

Their cheifs are always willing to help with special request (if any) and there is so many types of foods, it is just amazing. The pastry cheifs are also out of this world.

The rooms were fabulous...3 flat screen TV's and a HUGE soaking tub, glass showers, One and a 1/2 bathrooms...not to mention an exquisitely comfortable queen sized bed. HEAVEN! The room was way bigger than any standard room(separate sleeping area)...and I didn't feel like I was \"closed in\" (4 people stayed in one room comfortably!) The amenities were very nice...many bonuses! I found the staff to be very freindly and helpful...and the decor was super chic. It is a little far from the actual \"casino\", but it was nice to get away from all of the noise this time around. EVERYWHERE in Vegas takes awhile to get to anyways. Of course the pool was crowded...it is hot in VEGAS and who wouldn't want to swim...it really didn't bother me one bit. THE wave pool was cool....despite what others have said the waves were fairly large..LARGE ENOUGH to BODY surf! That's large to me! It is at the other end of the strip...BUT getting a cab is cheap and easy, so that wasn't really a prob/ The restaraunts in MBAY were kinda pricey...but that is expected in such a nice resort. The little poolside grill was affordable and the food was good. U can take it to the pool too! I thought the shark reef was WELL worth the price we paid...$17.00 I think? It was amazing. FOR nightlife RUM JUNGLE was very fun...a martini @ RED SQUARE is a must. Walk over to LUXOR and see BLUE MAN GROUP. I am telling u...this show is freaking AWESOME! OVERALL I think THEHOTEL is super cool...and I will stay again! It was very age friendly...older and younger! Oh and by the way...don't gamble there, the slots r very tight...there is a reason why no one ever wins there!"

Grounds were very clean, lots of people working hard there. Didn't gamble much, but walked through the casino often to get to restaurants and it didn't smell of smoke like other casinos. Bayside buffet is very good, but pricey. We tried other buffets at other restaurants, preferred Mandalay Bay. Hot steamed crab legs and really fresh fruit. Parking valet takes forever. Shark reef is pricey and takes 10 minutes to walk through. Cab to hotel from airport is only $10-12. Wished we would have known that before booking car rental that just sat in the garage!"

The Mandalay Bay casinio was the most comfortable of all on the strip and the pool area was well managed...only a bit crowded. The airport, and having to takeoff in 107 degree heat....well that's another story."

    "content": "This is a review of THEhotel @ Mandalay Bay. * Pro of the Room: Very Nice, Comfortable, Spacious, Nice fluffy Robes, Flip Flops, Mini bar, Plasma TV's, Very comfortable beds. Separate shower and tub, Great maid service, * Con of the Room: Mandalay bay sits behind Mandalay bay so you do not get a straight view of the strip like you would if you stayed at Mandalay Bay. However, you can still see some of the strip. The nice room though make up for the view. The internet cost $9.99 which they do not tell you until you are about to use the internet. Need more channels on the tv. * Pros of the SPA: (Bathhouse & SPA Mandalay) both were very nice. Both gyms were nice. Highly recommend that you get a spa treatment in one of the two places. Spa Mandalay is bigger because it has to accommodate more people. Overall I would say that the Bathhouse is slightly better when it comes to overall asthetics/feel for the place. * Cons of the SPA: Changing areas should have been more private. Steam room was not as steamy as should have been. Sauna was not as hot. $20.00 to use the gym(bathouse only) and $30.00 to use both the gym and spa. The $20.00 to use just the gym is not worth the money, Spa Mandalay does not give you the option to use just the gym only the Bathhouse. Pay the extra $10.00 and you get to use the sauna, whirlpools, steam room, free food and drinks, etc. * Pros of the Pool: Lots of beautiful people around. * Cons of the Pool: CROWDED as everyone has said. Get there early or bring your own chair. * Pros of the Restaurants: Lots of them. * Cons of the restaurants: Most of them are overprices but the buffet is good. I would suggest you go to other hotels because you will be able to eat cheaper. We ate at Excalibur at their buffet which cost $14.95 vice Mandalay's price of $24.99 Ride the tram to the other hotels and check out their food courts which offer cheap food and descent quality. Overall we loved our stay at THEhotel. We would stay there again however, we would gamble elsewhere and eat elsewhere. We bought our own water, and small alcohol bottles because we knew in the restaurants and elsewhere the cost of drink would be expensive. We saw Celine Dion which turned out rather pleasant. She puts on a great show. It does not matter where you sit because all seats can see the stage very well. Bring binoculars if you have them. Good luck hope this helps. Email us with specific questions."

My husband and I stayed from June 27th to July 1st and enjoyed every minute of it. We had the opportunity to look in at other hotels along the strip, THEhotel cannot be beat ... even by the Bellagio. I think the Bellagio is beautiful, but I think the workers are snobs, which does alot to distract from it's intrigue. The only thing I missed was a coffee machine, it got worrisome after awhile having to make daily treks down to THE coffeebar for a cup of Starbucks. But that's minor, and can definitely be overlooked when you are sipping that same cup of coffee while soaking in your tub and watching the news on the plasma tv. Overall, THEhotel was a very classy and sophisticated view of Vegas that I LOVED!"

    "content": "We stayed at the Mandalay Bay in early June 04. After reading some reviews on this website, we were a bit wary of the hotel, especially the beach/pool area. (1) Valet: Suprisingly very efficient and courteous. Perhaps the fact that we were VIP guests helped? (2) Check-in: We checked in at the special VIP room. Took a while, but quite friendly staff. (3) Rooms: We were traveling with another family of four (mine is also a family of four) and had a total of 3 rooms for the 8 of us. Room one had a double queen, Room two had one king, and Room Three was a Parlor Suite with 2 bedrooms and very large living room area. The rooms were extremely luxurious and clean. The bathrooms were HUGE, with 2 sinks, tub, and shower. Suite had jacuzzi tub. The views were great, especially the corner Parlor Suite...it had a view of the strip as well as the beach area. Can't say enough about the rooms--superb! (4) Beach/Pools: We were pleasantly surprised to find the beach to be not that crowded at all. We were there on a Sunday and got there about thirty minutes after it opened...no standing in lines at all. Plenty of lounge chairs to choose from. Wave pool is nice but waves were a little few-and-far between. Lazy river was great--very fast but the most crowded of all pool areas. For greatest relaxation, head to South Lagoon Pool...virtually no one there and pool is very nice. Poolside drink service a little slow. (5) Casino: We don't really gamble, so I wouldn't be good at rating the casino. Looked nice though! (6) Food: We ate one night at the Buffet, which was the largest and highest quality buffet ever. Unbelievable amount of choice...made to order pastas, meats, etc. Crowded, but our VIP passes worked wonders in skipping the long lines of people! (7) Shopping: Mandalay Place is the shopping area connecting the hotel to the Luxor next door. Nice area, good shops, not that crowded. (8) Theatre: We saw \"Mamma Mia!\" at the Mandalay Bay Theater, and it was wonderful! Great actors and music! Highly recommend! (9) Overall: Excellent! Mandalay Bay was a great experience...very relaxing and so much fun! Lots of things to do as well! Have fun in Vegas and make sure you stay here!"

We ate at Rum Jungle, it was delicious and the staff very friendly and professional. My boss played at the high stakes tables and we were very well taken care of. Went to the VIP room at Rum Jungle in the evening, what can I say, I had an escort to the bathroom, no standing in a line 50 people long. Everyone at the hotel was very helpful and we were treated like royalty. I totally understand that it was because my boss drops alot of cash there, but still, it was a wonderful experience. I can't wait to return."

    "content": "We checked in on Sat afternoon, June 26, and by Sun evening my youngest son was terribly sick, vomitting and severe diarhea. By Mon morning, he wasn't any better so we had to take him to the Emergency Room where he was treated for a stomach virus. It took him until Tuesday afternoon to fully recover, which is just about the same time that the other three of us started feeling severe stomach cramps. Rushing back to our room, we also started experiencing the vomittnig and diarhea symptoms of the stomach virus. And the vomitting is violent; we emptied out our stomachs in no time. It's kind of funny now thinking about how the three of us kept running to the bathroom last night. As we were preparing to check out today I did a quick check on the internet and found several references to the Norwalk virus or Norovirus that is going around Vegas and how contagious it is. (The virus can hang around for 30 days after a room is infected). So I decided to report our sicknesses to the front desk so they would know to clean our room before anyone stayed there. They sent up an EMT to our room to take our report and amazingly this EMT had NEVER heard of this virus. Wonder if he has been living under a rock for the last two years or if he was lying. I'll let you be the judge. I don't think the Vegas casinos or for that matter the Clark County Health Dept are being honest with visitors. These rooms where people are getting sick should be quarantined for at least 30 days so that rooms don't continue to expose people to the virus. Beware. You're taking a risk going to Vegas right now becasue this virus is aggressive and you're gong to get severely sick if you are exposed to it. Needless to say, we won't be coming back to Vegas and want others to know about this risk as well. Look it up yourself. Clark County is having a Norovirus Summit in July 04."

Many extra amenities, Tv's are's great. The linens, very high quality. Thin Down-blanket in between two sheets, nice touch. All hotel staff that we dealt with were professional and helpful. We got to the hotel at 9am, was told that they do not even start early check-in until noon. checked the bags and went to shop. Nice new shops in Mandalay Place between Mandalay Bay and the Luxor. Came back around about 10:30 and they were checking in people. Waited max 5 mins for check in. Bellman was quick and helpful. NEVER had to wait in line for a taxi (unlike at many other hotels). THEhotel has it's own secluded entrance for not many people there waiting for taxi service. No doubt that this is a high end property, but isn't that why you stay at a place like this. THEcafe was pricey but excellent food. Huge portions, never very crowded and fairly quick for a hotel cafe. The atmosphere of THEhotel is one of simple understandment and class. The lighting of the lobby and rooms make you feels relaxed. Small place but rivals Belligio's elegance, rooms for sure surpass. It's nice that Vegas has another nice propery . Hope it stays that way. You do not feel like you are in a Vegas hotel but the excitement of the casino is a short walk away . P.S. girls, the huge tube with bath powder and a flat screen t.v. to watch!!! Does it get any better than that?"

I read all the reviews about the lack of chairs at the pool and we had no problem getting 4 together. We ate at the buffet for brekfast and found it to be excellent. Afterwards, we headed for the pool at 10;30 with plenty of space available. The drink people were constantly present and there was no wait. Yes the wave pool's waves weren't very big but its a pool not a water park. We enjoyed the lazy river without a tube. other people have complained about the long walks to get anywhere but this place is hugh. They say this is one of the 3 top places to stay in vegas and I certainly agree."

However, we did have a few things during our stay that bothered us. #1 - the rooms do not have coffee pots, #2 - one unnamed female Blackjack dealer was extreemly rude to my boyfriend (we should have reported her), & #3 - the video poker was very bad. The Shark Reef exhibit is worth the money. My recommendation - stay ay Mandalay Bay and gamble somewhere else. P.S.

Still, I think the room was pretty average with a few frills here and there to get you to believe you're getting your money's worth. The \"wave pool\" was more a large pool with a tiny current every 15 minutes. Far from the idea of what a wave looks like. Still, we got a cabana and that was very nice. We were able to swim and go back to the cabana to eat. The hotel itself is very beutiful. They have sort of a modern tropics theme going on through the hotel. If I was going back to Las Vegas I might stay here again, but I think I want to look at what else is out there."

My husband and I spent 4 nights at Mandalay Bay, May 31-June 1. We checked in at 3 pm, Monday afternoon. Unfortunately, there was no room ready for us. The front desk offered us keys anyway, but the room itself had not been cleaned from the prior guest. It was a wreck and although housekeeping cleaned within 3 hours, it was a disheartening way to start the vacation. The room itself was fine. Nothing fancy, just a standard king sized bed, a small writing desk and a chair in the sitting area. There was no mini bar, which was surprising. The bathroom was spacious, but again, less impressive than I had heard. The hotel itself was beautiful. The lobby area was expansive and the decor was tasteful and elegant. The aroma throughout the hotel was divine. The casino was ample, with a great variety of slots. However, we were surprised at the limited number of table games. Additionally, I found the dealers to be rude and unfriendly. This was surprising. Usually, we have a great time sitting at the tables and socializing with the players and dealers. However, the dealers at MB were very serious and really uninterested in conversation. The drink service was fast and the cocktail waitresses were very efficient and pleasant. The breakfast buffet at MB is AWFUL. It was probably the biggest disappointment of the trip. I've had better breakfast at Denny's. The selection was very small. The food was dry and tasteless and even though the cost was only 14.00 dollars with tax, it wasn't worth even half that amount. STAY AWAY! We also dined at Rum Jungle and again the food was disappointing. Maybe the 5* restaurants of NYC have spoiled my palate, but this food was not what we had in mind. The pool was beautiful, pristine and great fun! Whenever the 107 degree heat got to me, I took a dip in the lazy river. FYI, bring your own tube! There's no need to pay 25 dollars a day to rent a tube from MB. Many people bring their own, as did we. The wave pool was nice too. However, the lifeguards are like babysitters and don't dare try to sit near the edge of the pool! You must be in at least 3 feet of water at all times! I asked the reasoning for this and a lifeguard did not answer me. I assume it has something to do with the waves. I think I've covered everything... Would I go back? Chances are, no. Next time we go to Vegas, (which may be never, as I wasn't overly impressed with the city as a whole.) we'll stay at Caesar's or The Bellagio, anywhere closer to the middle of the strip."

    "content": "Stayed at THEHotel 6/9-6/11. It is worth every penny. They offer early check-in at 10:00 a.m. and they honor a late check-out if available. The rooms and baths are beyond perfect. Bathrobes, slippers, bath amenities are some of the best I've encountered. Maid service was excellent. Request a room on Las Vegas Blvd. side as, surprisingly, the noise from Interstate 15 can be heard in the morning from rooms on that side. Staff at THEHotel are extremely accommodating. They have the attitude and training of personal service found in European grand hotels. Easiest way to access THEHotel's entrance is to park in Self Park's second floor (Valet parking is always slow), take one short flight of stairs down which lets you out right at THEHotel's valet parking lobby entrance. This saves long walk through Mandalay Bay's casino. Easiest way to pool is back through valet parking entrance, then very short walk to Mandalay Bay's garage entrance and then follow signs to Shark Reef. Take down escalator, exit to pool area, walking to your right which takes you to rear entrance of pool, which no one uses. This eliminates any possible line at main pool entrance and from having to walk through casino in pool clothes. Pool lines form on weekends. Wave pool water was extremely cold, even lifeguards were staying out of it. Do not expect any wave action. At best pool produces an undulating water movement which occurs at very long intervals. It basically just lifts you up slightly in the water. There is no way they should be advertising this as a wave pool. The lazy river's water was much warmer and everyone was in it. Don't pay the outrageous $20 fee to rent an inner tube. Bring your own or just float through the river. Lots of hotels now have versions of a lazy river, this is the shortest I've encountered. It's nice but don't expect a major water ride. Poolside bar service has improved, waitresses came by constantly checking on and delivering drink orders. The service at Raffles Cafe was the worst I've ever encountered ANYWHERE. This was the first time in my life I have not left a tip which did not seem to concern waiter at all. The food at Mandalay Bay is overpriced for what you get and there is no evening food court service. Casino slot action was pretty quiet, I never saw anyone doing any major (or minor) winning. I played many different machines--very \"tight\" slots here. Forget comps, Mandalay Bay Corporation is billions of dollars in debt and they are big time into \"nickle and dimeing\" customers. Absolutely stay at THEHotel, use the pool and eat and play slots elsewhere."

THE SPA is gorgeous, though was too expensive for me to actually have a treatment. The restaurants are great. We grabbed breakfast at THE CAFE, as well as lunch, and dinner. Mama Mia is playing there, though we didn't get tickets. Make use of the consierge to make restaurant recommendations and recommendations. Go to Charlie Palmer's Steak house....the best restaurant.

Every single person I encountered was friendly and helpful (but let me remind you, in vegas you must tip any and everyone to get good service!) We were very impressed with the room- it is beautiful (and in contrast to other reviews, exceptionally clean). The buffet here is great (esp the Sunday night champagne dinner and the breakfast).

And when we finally did get into a place to eat, I had to go back outside the resturant and wait in a huge line to use 1 of the 2 stalls in the bathroom! When we found others, they were slightly bigger but few and far between.

    "content": "What would one think when you hear Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas? Great resort? Think again. I was lucky that I did not have to pay the outrageous rate that most gamblers pay for visiting Las Vegas. But as the trip wore on I wondered what it would be like for me to sell this resort to some unsuspecting couple, they get there and the same things happen to them? First off I would like to say the view was by far the best I have seen in Las Vegas. I have stayed in 4 other hotels on the strip. We had a nice view of the Mandalay Beach area, but don\u2019t let that fool you. I used the bathroom as soon as I arrived in the room only to find long black hair and a plastic clear cover from a makeup compact directly on the floor in front of the toilet. If I could see it, why couldn\u2019t the maid. That night we used the sinks (2) and the one plugged, came to the top then sloooowly drained. The light above one vanity was burned out and I felt I should leave it until the next morn and the maid would see this as she cleaned. Not the case, still out and she left all the bathroom lights on for our convenience up arrival back to the room, how could she not see this?? That morn as I stepped into the shower, the handle fell off, yes; just fell off in my hands. At approx 1330 that day I reported this to the front manager, I returned back to my room at approx 2330. Yes, you guessed it! Nothing had been done. The poor maintenance man apologized up and down for the last 2 shifts not responding and in the meanwhile he accidentally left with a bag full of deodorant, clippers, pills, etc., at least we think it was him\u2026it was there that morning and then it was gone. We have no proof other than it disappeared when he came to our room. We never called him to check as I wasn\u2019t important stuff. Anyhoooo, the next morning we decided to get a quick coffee and a muffin at the \u201cKona Caf\u00e9\u201d, sure hope they cleaned the place since we were there!!! The service was prompt but NOT courteous. We looked for a clean table, not gonna happen! One table had a muffin smeared all over top and as the tables are clear glass, you could well imagine what was seen on the floor while eating. This wasn\u2019t a restaurant, just a small \u201ceat and run\u201d corner joint. The table we had had coffee stains all over and the one next to us had newspaper stuck to the table top. No one was attempting to clean at all. As we left the smeared muffin was still on the first table and the newspapers were now scattered all over the chairs with the muffin crumbs. Okay, so on with the \u201cBeach\u201d. The sand area is small with every chair crammed together like sardines. Chairs were dirty from drink spills as were the little tables, unbelievable! Now for the sand area\u2026..just a large ashtray for those who smoke. Butts everywhere you step! Now, I\u2019ve been to many beaches from Canada to Mexico to Hawaii to Europe and they have huge continuous beaches so I can understand butts in the sand there. But for Mandalay Bay one would think they would have some daily maintenance on a sandy area no bigger than an NBA basketball court. But then again this is Las Vegas, they only worry about the almighty dollar and they got yours as soon as you paid your travel agent. One nice thing is the Raffles Cafe. Well priced and good service the night we were there. The Shark Buffet for breakfast was something out of a Mexican all-inclusive resort\u2026. \u2026bacon, mushy scrambled eggs and potatoes, same thing on the other side. Hard, crusty yesterday\u2019s pastries with of course bread pudding that all Mexican chefs are famous for. The night life at the Rum Jungle looked very exciting as there seemed to be a line up every evening. Dancing girls in cages above the dance floor and great music. As our time was limited we didn\u2019t eat at the other restaurants the Mandalay had to offer but I\u2019m sure they would have been okay. If you have been to Sea world in California or Orlando you may want to skip the Sharks Reef. Just another money grabbing gimmick to see a few big toothy fish. Overall I was not impressed with this hotel at the price they sell it for. It is rumored that the boys from MGM are in talks about buying this hotel (if they haven\u2019t already). Good Luck! Most hotels in Vegas are in clusters owned by certain groups (or single) of people. Hope this one falls in good hands\u2026\u2026.soon!"

    "content": "Stayed at Mandalay Bay for four nights in May. Arrived late thanks to a cancelled flight and the room with king size bed that we had \"requested\" was no longer available. However, they were able to move us into a room w/ king size bed on a high floor overlooking the pool the very next day so I can't complain too much about that. There was a boxing match in the hotel that weekend so it was very crowded but we knew that before we came. The service at the hotel was so-so. Generally, if we sat in any bar area we would wait 5 to 10 minutes and no one would come around to take our order so my husband would go to the bar for a drink. All beers are $5.50 (including Bud Light and other domestic swill) which is high but you are paying for the atmosphere at the hotel. I suggest walking over to the Tropicana or Flamingo for cheap drinks (or going downtown to Fremont area). Complaints re: the location of the hotel are unfounded - yes, it is at one end of the strip but there is a free monorail which will take you all the way to the Excalibur/NY NY/MGM area. Also, the walk is not that bad - we walked all the way from Mandalay to the Flamingo/Caeser's Palace/Paris area and it took about 15 minutes (at a leisurely pace). Get out and walk - it won't kill you and you can cut through the inside of the hotels to avoid the heat. Rooms are nice - floor to ceiling windows, marble bath w/ separate shower, double sink/vanity. Pool looked great but was crowded on the weekend (we're not pool people so did not go down there). It did close at 6:00pm sharp. Atmosphere of the hotel was fun - a young \"hip\" crowd, which we enjoyed since we're in our late twenties (great people watching - many \"look at me I'm so cool\" types, which gave us many good laughs). Casino is large and airy but the table limits do tend to be high (only saw a few $10 blackjack tables and they were always full). Restaurants - buffet was great, good price and food was excellent - definitely worth the money. The Raffles Cafe was good for a late night bite but I have to give a thumbs down to the Noodle Shop - food was bland and unappetizing. Overall, a nice hotel but service definitely goes down when it's crowded but I expect that will be the case anywhere you go."

    "content": "This was my first stay at THEhotel @ Mandalay Bay, and all I can say is \"WOW!\". We received an early check in on Sunday (about 1:00 pm) with no problems, and immediately went upstairs to check out the room. Incredible! Seperate living room with a 42\" plasma TV, DVD player, plush decor, and very nice views (22nd floor). There was a smallish guest bathroom just inside the front door, which we did not use. The bedroom was equally plush, with a large flat-screen TV, plenty of room to store our clothes, and a VERY comfortable bed. The bathroom is just awesome. It has a large glass shower, bathtub big enough for two, seperate toilet room, large sink area, and a 15-17\" Plasma TV. Yes, a plasma TV in the bathroom. I would normally think, \"who is going to watch TV in the BATHROOM??!!?\". Well, let me tell you. After spending the day at the main pool (which was very nice, btw), we came back to the room, and watched the Laker game from the tub while sipping on red wine. Very nice! The service was great, and everyone that I dealt with went out of their way to be friendly, and help out with anything I needed (no problems, so I didn't require a lot of attention). We ate at the sushi bar in the hotel, which was fantastic. For dinner, we chose Alize at the Palms, which was incredible. Fairly expensive, but the views are to die for (56th floor). We then went back to the hotel to check out Red Square, which is a louge/bar at the main hotel. I personally wasn't that impressed with the place. It was nice enough, but seemed more like a standard bar than what I would consider a lounge to be (dimly lit, atmospheric music, etc.). We also checked out Rum Jungle (main hotel, again), and had a good time, even though this club's prime has long-since past by. If you're seriously looking to go out clubbing, look elsewhere (Rain, etc.). Overall, we had an incredible time, and had no complaints with the service. The rooms were AWESOME, and btw, they had no problem when I requested a late check-out (1:00 pm). As of now, this room is setting the bar for me, as far as Vegas hotels go."

Checking-in is very nice but also can take a long time to get to the front desk. Since we flew to Las Vegas, we checked in pretty much when everybody else did....Around 12:00 O' Clock I believe. The lines were massive! The hotel is huge!! It isn't your average hometown style inn. This place has tons of rooms. It is hard to believe that we had a standard room and that it had a marble granite top bathroom with a beautiful sinking tub and glass shower. It is very nice. The service is very nice too. The staff is very friendly and polite. The pool area is awesome. They have a lazy river, an artificial beach, 2 grand pools, nice jacuzzi's, a pool restaurant and much more. You will definitely enjoy it. The elevators are very fast. We were on the 28 floor and the views were nice. They had 8 express elevators to floors 17-36. The elevators did get full, but they went very very fast. The hotel has a total of 42 floors. The whole building makes up Mandalay Bay. Five floors of the building belong to a small hotel called The Four Seasons. The Casino is very nice. It seems to have excellent service and has alot of gaming machines and tables. The Mandalay Bay is very nice for families. We didn't go to gamble, but to relax. Well.. Kinda. Las Vegas is very bright.. You will really like the scenery. The restaurants are very good and their parking is good too.. ENJOY!"

    "content": "If you are into long lines, young 20-somethings being loud and obnoxious AND rude staff, then THIS is the hotel for you! My girlfriend and I (both early 30's) were in town for a convention and were staying at the Treasure Island and having a wonderful time enjoying amenities. Once our husbands flew in for the weekend, we had made reservations to switch hotels to the Mandalay Bay so we all could enjoy the pool, etc. Researched thoroughly before arriving, at several travel sources and couldn't really find any significant negative findings, but I'll tell you that this place basically ruined our vacation. Didn't have any problem with check in as I read elsewhere and they were very helpful when we asked to move rooms due to some rowdy neighbors (which I understand is not under their control). The pool is only open to 7pm! HELLO -- THIS IS VEGAS, home of 110 degree days in the summer. The sun sets after 8:30 and you'd have to live under a rock to not realize that the POOL is why a majority of people decide to stay here!!!! and by the way, it's not THAT great -- I was a little shocked that all the talk was about THIS! They also have a topless sunbathing area, but there's a cover charge...sorry boys! :) And the evenings of concerts (both Sat and Sun), the pool closes at 6pm. There were 2 concerts on Saturday and my husband had to park the car after dinner at a staggering 25-30 minute walk from our room because all parking garages with immed access to the hotel were full -- no convenient parking area for GUESTS!! I would have been more angered having to carry luggage that distance or deal with kids! Abundant pot smoking in the parking garage too by the way! I'm all for people having fun and all but I was under the impression that a hotel at $300/night would draw an older, more refined crowd -- boy, was I wrong! 4 Blackjack tables for $10/hand...the rest at $25/hand. The lack of smell of cig smoke was a real draw in the casino and we probably stayed to play longer because of it, but not worth staying there again. Went to the pool at 5:30 one evening before a concert, and was stopped by security saying \"We're trying to set up for the concert\" When we responded that we wanted to enjoy the pool until it closed, his response was \"Why bother? You only have a half hour\" and so on and so on. The unpleasant people were located at the valet (full both sat and sun nights by the way), bell hops and pool staff. Everyone else is engaging. Aureole is not worth missing even if you go to have a couple drinks -- ask the see the \"wine angels\" who retrieve the wine from the 4 story tower -- but, again you can see them by staying at another hotel also! NOT WORTH THE MONEY!! And WILL NEVER STAY again! By the way, this is the first review I have ever written -- I just read so many positives for this hotel and had such a NEGATIVE experience, I had to include it! Better off staying at Treasure Island!"

The bathroom was very big and beautiful. The negatives. The location stinks and you are all the way at the end of the strip. The pool was so crowded (only on the weekend) that we could not find a single lounge chair to lay out on. The service was so so when we checked in and the agent was very welcoming. Also, we lost over $2000 at the casino and they didn't comp us a single penny of it. We spent lots of money on food and the spa there and they wouldn't pick up any of it. I think at a smaller casino, my $2000 loss and the hours I spent at the tables, would have gotten us something of a comp, but here, I felt like a little peon, because the casino is so big and there are so many high rollers. Also, we didn't like the fact that they don't have a food court over many food options, other than expensive sit down restaurants. We wouldn't recommend staying here."

I really liked the overall feel of the public spaces, quiet and soothing, with minimalist furnishings. I got breakfast once at the cafe, but never went to the bar. Our suite would have been fine for 2 people- a little tight for four girls at night getting ready, though we had an extra half bath that helped a lot. For some reason the rooms were laid out so that our bedroom was adjacent to the people next door's living room. So at 4am they started blasting music and it woke us up. However, I called down to the front desk and figured out which room it was and they called up and the noise stopped. there are some cool touches- nice stereo, two plasma TVs, and yummy bath products. Great shower, too. A main drawback is that the rooms were very dark, especially at night- there aren't any overhead lights, it's mostly these subdued track lights that don't really do anything. Housekeeping was excellent and she did a great job stocking us with lots of extra towels and products. The spa was very pretty and nice, and I had a wonderful therapist named Linda for a massage. Though I think the daily charge to use the gym ($25) is ridiculous! Oh yeah, and the front desk staff seemed rather clueless when we checked in. They forgot to give one of us a key and weren't very welcoming."

    "content": "Wow--we are floored by the polarized reviews we're reading here about The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. Seems it really depends on Lady Luck how your stay goes. I guess we lost! We thought the property was very appealing, and yes, the muted lighting and lack of its own casino makes a welcome respite from Vegas' overload. The rooms are spacious and attractive, the tvs and big soaking tubs are a nice touch, the linens are quality, the beds comfy. But the service, or lack thereof, was pretty amazing for a property that is striving to be five star, with cost to match. Service varied from rude, to indifferent, to non-existent, but was never friendly or efficient. Don't think a luxury hotel means anyone will offer to help you with your bags, or resolve problems with your reservation, keys, or stinky rooms, or help you make dinner reservations, direct you to the proper location for shuttle pick up to the airport, or even think of doing ANYTHING that smacks of \"going the extra mile.\" Several problems were not resolved and the staff clearly didn't care. The pool is better than many in Vegas but is too crowded and the servers seem harried. We rented a private cabana and still had very poor service.(and yes, THE POOL is a long way away from THE HOTEL but hey, everything in Vegas is big and spread out, so we didn't find that to be a big deal.) One weird quirk of our room was that we could hear every word spoken by another party in a nearby room (above? next door? still not sure) through the air vent in our bathroom. Very odd. Oh, and if you want a 30 minute extension on your 11 am check out time? Don't even bother to ask! NO! One illustrative highlight of our experience (granted this was in the main Mandalay Bay complex, not THE HOTEL) was waiting for 20 minutes in the half deserted 24 hour cafe, at 11:30 pm the night we arrived, for a waiter to bring us water and take our order while we watched 9 waitstaff stand around and talk. One was, I kid you not, picking his nose. This property could be wonderful with an all new, properly trained and friendly staff. But I'm not going back unless I am assured there's been a major overhaul in staff and attitude. Btw, we are big believers in being friendly, respectful and assertive when necessary. This was not a case of rude guests getting rude service. They just seemed understaffed, overwhelmed and unconcerned. I guess there's just always more new guests where we came from."

The room, an end room was actually two rooms, a super sitting room with a view of the mountains, that contained a couch, tea table, end tables and lamps, bar, flat screen TV, desk. The bedroom was very comfy, with two big windows looking out on a great view. Another flat screen tV, and a third in the bathroom where I watched CNN from the comfort of my oversized bath tub. Everything was beautifully detailed. The Mandalay Bay casino and pool are a bit of a hike away, but they are adding a pool to the Hotel at some point in the future. It was a perfect place to stay and I highly recommend it."

I really enjoyed the large flat screen TV in the living room and bedroom. The small flat screen in the bathroom was an exceptional amenity. Staff was also friendly and efficient. We ate breakfast at the Caf\u00e9 in the lobby which was good. Definitely take heed and get to the pool early (i.e., 9 AM) if you want a lounge chair. We chose to avoid the crowds and spent our pool time at the Moorea Beach Club. The service, comfortable lounge chairs, pool, and food/drinks were all very good and I would highly recommend it.

    "content": "We took our vacation May 10th-14th. Our stay at the Mandalay Bay was Great! I read a lot of the reviews on this site before we left and I think some of those reviewers were a little critical. It's was about $13.00 via taxi from McCarran to the Mandalay Bay. We were addressed right away at Registration, friendly staff all around (NO snobs). It was a Monday so those of us checking in were fewer than say a Friday. Elevators are easily accessed, excellent signage is everywhere so its easy to find you way. Went right up to our room, it was VERY good size for 2 adults and 2 teens. The bathroom's Large with a seperate shower and soaking tub, the toilet is by itself behind a closed door. Lots of amenities...shampoo, conditoner, bath salts, soap, Qtips, cotton balls, bathrobes if you request them, iron and board. The room has a wall to wall, floor to ceiling tinted window to look out of (request the pool view, the strip isn't much to see from this far down). Normal size TV (this is just a standard room mind you), alarm clock, internet access...the TV gives you the choice of in-room movies (if you're traveling with kids I'll let you know that there are no Disney, Nickelodeon, or Cartoon Network channels) it was a bummer for my kids. The rooms are kept cool, linens changed daily (maid service was never a problem), towels replaced as were the used amenities. The elevators go directly down to the pools, so you don't have to walk across the Casino floor with your swimsuit on. There are a few different snack bars down at the pool area, some burgers, sandwiches, ice cream, drinks, cocktails etc., also a small beach shack with sandles, goggles, sunglasses, shirts, and such. The cocktails are about $8.00 each. You can bring beverages into the pool area as long as the container is not glass. (We took a plastic flask and brought Rum to add to our soft drink), Mandalay Bay does not serve or carry Coke products, only Pepsi, you'll have to head out to 'Walgreen's' or 'The Grand Canyon Experience' for it, on the same side as MGM. We were there during the week so the pool area was not mobbed and we found excellent seating. I would recommend getting down there around 10-11am Monday-Thursday (the pool opens at 9am), it starts getting packed after that, and yes the seats are very much crammed together. Music plays at the pool but if you have \"Jabber-walkies\" sitting next to you, you won't hear anything but them. Great pool, the best on the strip, towels are given upon entry (I liked MGM just as much, so did our kids). The wave pool was not what we saw in pictures, the waves aren't much of anything for adults but for small kids they were, we were told it was reduced because of an accident not to long ago. The Lazy River is where we spent time, it was busy, refreshing and much warmer than the wave pool (you can rent a tube for $20 bucks, but we just waited until someone left there's). There are two other pools in the area (mostly adults at them). People do come and go so finding a seat isn't too much of a struggle unless your looking for 3 or more together. There is a store in the hotel in case you forget something, and there's always something to forget. Our beds were comfortable, a little on the stiff side though, there is noise in the morning due to the maid staff, but hey they have to do there job sometime and 9:00 am is that time, so if you need total quiet I suggest earplugs. We gambled a bit, the minimum blackjack wager is $10, same at Dice. No one seemed to be winning big, tough casino to win at, no laughter or fun. But there is the Excalibur and NyNy with $5.00 table minimums. So. all and all I would recommend the MB, at least once. P.S. If you plan on attending the Wet & Wild waterpark, it doesn't open until May17th (we didn't know). Plus the cabbies were telling us that Vegas is changing, less family stuff. They figure the parent's don't gamble as much with the kids along. But it seemed just as expensive if not more with all the rides and arcades. Have a good one :)"

The resort being at the southern end of the strip caused us no concern at all. We took the tram to Excalibur and from there you are on your way to the center of the strip. We would definitely stay there again."

Service was an A+, we had everything we needed with just a phone call, and they arrived within minutes of our requests.The suite was beautiful, if a little dark. The bathrooms were worth the price of the room. The pools were gorgeous- if a little packed. We just went down early and grabbed our chairs. One minor detail- they charges for tube rental for the lazy river. That was a little over the top in my book.Overall- amazing hotel- would stay again!!!"

Contemporary styles and very large rooms, as well as private entrance without having to walk through a casino, make this unlike any other hotel I've stayed in Vegas. Staff were responsive and polite, the spa/gym were very nice, although having to pay $30/day for the privilege seems a bit much. I will definitely return. One HUGE problem: the pool at Mandalay Bay. It appears that there is one chair for every two pool-goers, making it very difficult to find one and a very competitive, contentious environment with a lot angry guests. We arrived at the pool at 9:30am (it opens at 9:00am), and were fortunate enough to find two chairs, one of which was broken and had to be carried quite a distance to allow me to sit with my wife. Also, if you don't have a chair, there really are no places to just sit on your towel and get some sun. We saw several guests just turn around and leave, as there is just not enough space to accommodate everyone. Here is hoping that they build another pool solely for The hotel users. Overall, a tremendous experience, if you skip the pool."

    "content": "This was our first trip to Vegas that was not business related and it was our 15 year anniversay. Let's start with the bad things. The down side to the hotel is its location to the strip, it's at the end. This can quickly be remedied by using the tram which takes 30 minutes off the walk up the strip and drops off right next to NY-NY. The pool does get overly crowded for the amount of chairs and the cost for a tube to use the lazy river is high, $20 per tube (all-day rental). I would suggest that you float without one. That's the bad. The good, is the overall hotel, it's beautiful. The casino floor was not smoke filled as most of the other hotels are. As a non-smoker this was important. The restraunts were great and reservations were no problem, but plan to make reservations atleast 24hrs ahead of time. The Shark Reef was great and is well worth the 12.50/per charge. A couple in line gave us their 2-for-1 so that was even better! The rooms were great and better than expected, very clean and new. The lack of kids there was the best, compared with NY-NY which seemed overrun with them. We ate at Charlie Palmers Ateak House, which is located in the Four Seasons (connected), the service and food were excellent! Would I stay there again? I'm booking another stay there in July!"

For anyone that wants first dibs on a beach chair and location, you need to be down at the pool area by 8:30-8:45 am to avoid standing in a very long line (although it does move pretty quickly).If you are looking for a decent place to hang out and get drinks and listen to music at the hotel, head to the Island Lounge.

My wife and I are both in our late 20's and we have been blessed enough to visit some of the world's best properties. The uncompatrable service we received at The Hotel left me obligated to spread the word. As a frequent Vegas visitor I have stayed at all of the top hotels Bellagio, Venetian, and Mandalay Bay. On our most recent trip to Vegas April 22-25 we had the privelage to stay at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. I was terribly disappointed with my last stay in Vegas at the Venetian (which in my opinion is going down hill fast!) and I was hoping for The Hotel to redeem my enthusiasm for Vegas. It did! Words cannot describe the experience we had. The room was better than the pictures on the website and The Bathouse spa was simply lavish. The extravagant simplicity of The Hotel sets a new standard for Vegas. The themed hotel is fastly disappearing as Vegas attempts to draw a upscale crowd who comes to spend money and leave the kids at home. This is the first time I left Vegas actually feeling relaxed. It is great to be able to walk into Mandalay bay for the gambling and excitement of Vegas and then when you are done retreat back to your personal sanctuary in The Hotel. If you are looking to experience the new Las Vegas look no further than The Hotel. I honestly see no competition until possibly next year when Steven Wynn launches his new project. Until then if you want the best call The Hotel. One hint make sure you emphasize THE hotel or they'll know you are a toursit. You'll see what I mean."

The standard rooms are nice and the floor to ceiling windows are a nice touch...although we didn't have much of a view! Bathrooms are roomy! By far...the best part of the Mandalay Bay is the SPA! Three of us girls treated ourselves (pretty high price) but it was worth every penny! If you stay, even if you don't get a particular treatment, visit the spa! It is worth the $27 day-pass rate! The treatments are worth it, though!!! There were a couple of minor problems. The rooms could have been cleaned better. Also, finding a chair at the pool was always a challenge and the lines at the pool snack bar took 45 minutes each day! Also, it is at the end of the strip so plan on a lot of walking to get up to the other hotels. All in all a really nice property! Will definitely return."

There is a small bathroom with toilet and sink in the entryhall and then the main bathroom has two sinks, a HUGE tub with separate shower stall and a separate toilet room. The lobby area is very nice and completely separate from Mandalay Bay so there are no slot machines, etc. The casino is just a short walk down a hallway, but I will admit that getting to the pool can be a pain in the rear. It was a 9-minute walk from our room. Kind of funky when you're in flip-flops and a bathing suit with tanning oil all over you. However, even with that little problem we decided when we stay at Mandalay Bay we would probably only stay over on THEHotel side from now on."

As far as the hotel it is very beautiful but when we went to the casino it was as if the servers were on strike. It always took at least 15-20min to get a drink if you were at the slots. The table games were much better however. The restruants had good food but was extremely overpriced in my opinion. The pool was nice but not as nice as the travel channel made it out to be.

Our suite was gorgeous and well equipped with 2 bathrooms(one a powder room, the other a master bath.) Was nice having a door to separate the bedroom from the living room for privacy. The beds were the most comfortable we have ever slept in. Great master bathtoom with fragrant bath amenities, nice large fluffly towels, a comfortable soaking bathtub for two, and a marble glassed-in shower with strong water pressure. Nice wet bar and 3 flat screen tv's in the suite. The coffee bar and cafe downstairs were reasonably priced with great food! Service and housekeeping were tops. The subdued lighting throughout the hotel made you mellow and the entire hotel was quiet-a true oasis away from the noise of the rest of the Strip. The only thing keeping this hotel from a 5-star rating: it needs its own pool area. The pool area it shares with the Mandalay Bay Hotel is too crowded and lounge chairs are hard to find unless you get there early in the morning-and we prefer to sleep late while in Vegas! But the hotel staff told me that they were planning on building their own pool to be ready around the summer of 2005, so by then I truly believe TheHotel will have earned a 5-star rating. We will definitely stay here again during our next trip to Vegas! We recommend staying here without any hesitation."

Got a Cabana for 150 a day- VIP service, drinks included, paded lounge chairs, and butler service- this was definately worth the price, considering that day we didnt have to worry about getting a chair. One word of Advice- stay away from the Palms Hotel off strip- you know, the one that the Real-World was filmed in. Somone put something in my drink there and a week later I am still feeling sick. I was lucky enough to leave that place when I was starting to feel sick. Rain and Ghost Bar are very overrated.

The room was perfect, great decor and 3 flat screen TV's, one in the bathroom (nothing like watching TV while soaking in the tub). Having stayed before we knew the pool would be crowded but this time it was ridiculous. If you are looking for a nice relaxing pool area stay somewhere else. I've read complaints on this site about the walk to the pool being 15-20 minutes, these people must be slow walkers because it was no more than 5 minutes. Nothing wrong with a little exercise. The spa at THEhotel is not as large as Spa Mandalay but its not crowded and well worth the $30 day pass price. The Cafe at THEhotel is open 24 hours and is a good place to eat especially for some late night breakfast after gambling. Red, White & Blue is the worst dining spot, don't eat there. The Turf Club in the Race & Sports Book is a good place to eat if you get tired of spending $$$ on big meals."

We were welcomed by courteous luggage porters immediately, waited about 15 seconds for front desk to check us in, where we were upgraded to a V-Suite on the 35th floor with a Fantastic Corner View, 3 FULL windows, could see the Rio Casino all the way to the airport. 3 plasmas as stated for V-suite (1 DVD player in living area), 2 seperate controls for climate control, (1 bedroom, 1 living area) and wonderful quality Bath amenities, glass shower and HUGE individual tub (more than enough room for two) very decent pricing for items in the wetbar. Room was clean and housekeeping kept it in great shape, very slight wear showing in carpet already. 2 toilet areas. Outside the Door, is literally a Door Bell and 2 lighted buttons, 1 for housekeeping (green light) and 1 for \"Do Not Disturb\" (red light) Our particular corner room was lacking sufficient drawer space to fully unpack, may have been due to our corner room, since we literally had more windows than walls. FYI: Internet TV is not Fully Java compatible, stick with DSL. We spent a fair amount of time in the room and the bed is fairly comfortable and Room Service was quick and efficient, food was very, very good for Vegas Room Service. THECafe is a great hidden treasure at Mandalay, even if your not staying at THEhotel, highly consider going there to eat, food is not pricey, service is great and food is really good. Constant cleaning of the entry way and lobby, the employees really strive to keep the place in very pristine cleanliness. It's nice to walk in and not hear the clinking and music of a casino, very relaxing to enter and proceed to your room. BATHHOUSE Spa at THEhote: My wife used their services and was overly satisfied with their services and service. Overall, hotel service was consistently excellent and the times we ate via room service or THECafe, the food and waiters/waitresses were wonderful. Definitely a \"non-vegas\" style hotel to stay if you want to go to vegas but don't want to stay at LAKE LAS VEGAS to \"get away\" from the hoopla. Location: If we wished to go to the \"strip hotels\", we used the tram to Excalibur and took a cab from MGM if we needed to venture opposite side of strip. We had hoped the MGM TRAM would be operational but they are still in \"testing\" phase, but once it is, the location of the MB is a non-issue as the new TRAM will go from MGM to SAHARA. THEhotel uses the resources from the MBay, so pool usage is kinda a pain, really got to get there early to \"find a spot\", which we did. We enjoyed our time at the pool and never found an issue with having to wait for drinks, about 5 minutes or so. I read some of the complaints about \"the pool\", but considering that this pool is rated #1 in vegas, everyone is clamoring to 'get in', a little crowded definitely. If your looking for great service and spending some quality time in your room with your loved one and don't mind taking the tram, THEhotel met and exceeded our \"weeklong\" getaway. I Highly recommend a stay at THEhotel; if all your looking for is a bed and a shower, stay somewhere else as you won't enjoy the room and the hotel. For us, we had a wonderful stay at THEhotel and excellent memories from the courteous staff and fantastic suite."

Pluses included getting free upgrade to a suite in Fiji wing facing strip on 27th floor simply by asking. Room was great, but tempted to pay the extra $50 next time to check out the supposedly amazing THEHotel. Had safe, fridge, wet bar, 2 person jacuzzi tub, sitting area, and great strip view. Pool was awesome! (just opened for the season 4/1/04 and Lazy River on 4/9/04). Waves are not bad, people who said they were too weak were standing in the deep end where you really don't feel it. Try going to the shallow end (if the whistling lifeguards let you). You don't have to get the inner tube for the Lazy River, it's fine just swimming or wading around. Other people said wait til the end of the day to get a free inner tube. Pool open 9am-6pm now (not 5pm like others are saying). Pool line is pretty riduculous I have to agree. You really have to be down there by like 8:30 a.m. One thing to note, there are 3 doors to the pool people... you don't have to wait at the closest one. Cabana would be nice but costs like $200 a day, so just wait in line if you're not really rich. Prices weren't bad for weekdays ($109), but nearly doubles on weekends ($189). Since Bellagio and Venetian prices are always \"weekend\" MB prices, would consider staying there if it doesn't include weekends. Smoke at casino was little less than other casinos. Nice vanilla smell they pump into the ventilation system. Very quiet unlike other hotels. Not as crowded as the other hotels on the Strip. Very classy. Tram to Luxor and Excalibur easy to use. Elevators relatively quick w/ little wait. Check-in relatively easy unlike what I read by other TripAdvisor reviews. BUT this was a weekday check-in I don't know about weekends. Check-in the day I was there began at 12 Noon, which was nice. Can get robes for free on request. Minuses include very high table limits and tight slots. Also very far from the rest of the strip, you really need a rental car or you'll wait in the long taxi lines. So far from Strip that it's tough to stop by in the middle of the day. Would leave in AM and not come back until late in PM. Would be amazing if had more central location but given the prices, it's tolerable. Service was decent, not horrible, not great. Slow getting room cleaned. Charged us for water that we didn't drink that we disputed and they removed. Long wait on phone to get a front desk person or housekeeping. Long, long walk to elevator or ice or vending machine. Shops at Mandalay Place between MB and Luxor quite lame (but expensive!) compared to shopping at places like Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes, Aladdin Desert Passage, or Caesar's Forum Shops."

    "content": "For all the complaints about service here, I found it to be quite good during our stay, April 5-9. Check-in was a bear - they definetly need a better system than the free-for-all lines that start forming around 11:30am. But they do let you check in at noon, which is unusual for Strip hotels, many of which make you wait until 3pm. We called the front desk the first night because our next-door neighbors were extremely loud throughout the night, and were promised an upgrade to a suite the next day for our troubles, which came through as promised. We were extremely polite when we called to complain, so perhaps this is the key to good service, rather than making demands or giving the staff attitude. The pool area is a madhouse, but we did not mind leaving our towels and cover-ups on what little space we could find while swimming. Still, if one did want to sunbathe, getting a chair would have been next to impossible - they would do well to try to improve this situation. The dealers at the tables were mostly great, and the drink service was excellent, again despite reports to the contrary (and we never go higher than the $10 tables, so it's not like we were in the high rollers area). The sports book is great - one of the best on the Strip. Checked out THEHotel - looked very swank, but not sure it's worth the extra $$ unless you spend a lot of time in your room, but who does that in Vegas? Overall, we were very pleased, and would definetly stay here again."

    "content": "The Good: The beach was fun. The service was good. The room was nice. Elevators were fast. Tram to the other casinos was fun for the kids. The Bad: Don't forget your room key for everyone going to the pool, including toddlers. Crowded at the pool, very crowed. Don't expect to get a chair if your not in line by 8:30am. No coffee in the rooms. Go down the elevator and stand in line to get a 3.00 cup of coffee. I just don't understand this for a four star hotel. Hint: gamble your 3 bucks and order coffee from the drink girl. The Ugly: If you do happen to get a chair at the beach, you will be crowed with every family in the hotel. There is no room between chairs. So, if your in the second row of chairs from the beach, and your kids want to go swimming it is an adventure. Oppositely, if your in the front row expect to be dripped and trampled on. Food at the beach is great, save money and bring your own. Getting food at the beach is expensive and uncomfortable because of the location. People walk by you on the way to the bathroom and searching for seats. Shark Reef, Awsome my kids said. I refused to pay the 15.95, enough about that. Kids: We found it more kid friendly at the other casinos. Video games, shops, eating all were less expensive and more kid friendly. My kids said the best video games were at the MGM. Speaking of MGM, we notice that you have to walk forever to get the pool area, at Mandalay the elevator takes you to the pool area."

Okay, I should not have taken the kids to Vegas, but still at nearly $200 per night, I expected a relaxing experience. The biggest problem was the pool. The main reason we stayed there was because the pool was supposed to be so great. It was wall to wall people, not a single chair in sight. We had to park ourselves on whatever small patch of cement we could find. Waited an hour (no joke) for the pool waitress to bring a drink. Plus the trek to the pool from The Hotel is probably 20 minutes (through the casino, of course.) The pool was not the only problem. Housekeeping didn't clean our room all day. It took 2 angry phone calls to get them to show up. It took them 2 hours to get our bags up to our room when we checked in. In all fairness, the suite we had was beautiful, but the TV was stuck in the ON position and the phone in the living room did not work. Overall it was a miserable experience."

Dragging the suitcases through the typical casino maze to the lobby was actually more entertaining at Mandalay than other hotels on the strip. This is a huge hotel! We were immediately upgraded to the suite for $35 per night extra, simply by asking. The room was amazing! King Bed, Bathroom with standup shower + separate jacuzzi tub, wet bar, and couch/sitting area. Comparable to the \"Players Suites\" at the NY NY or other high end rooms. As far as the casino goes, we love to gamble and this was one of the better hotels to do it at. Card tables were always busy, but you didn't have to wait long to grab a seat. The drink service was above par. I could barely slam my drinks fast enough! The buffet was excellent - a bit more expensive than others $28 for dinner, but worth it. The only complaint I have is that the pool and beach (best on the strip) is only open between 9:00 and 5:00. Whenever we came to the beach it was impossible to find a seat. I guess you have to get up at 8:00 and be the first to grab a chair. Overall - it was an excellent experience."

Our room looked just like the pictures on the mandalay bay website. We had a great view of the lower end of the strip. Housekeeping was prompt and wonderful! Our room was immaculate each day we were there. One of the best things about THEhotel is that it is set apart from all the noise of the casino. It was so nice to come back at the end of the day and not have to deal with hearing the clink clink of change coming from the slot machines. The lighting and soft music was a much welcome break from the rest of Vegas. The restaurants were a little pricey but what else would you expect from Vegas! THEcafe has a wonderful menu and the food and service were fabulous. We ordered room service our last morning there- they came and set everything up for us and surprisingly it was not all that expensive. We would definately stay at THEhotel again and I would recommend it to anyone! We are already trying to go back to Vegas. I loved THEhotel!!!!!"

    "content": "My friends were very excited to stay at Mandalay Bay. \"I want to go 4-star\" was the quote. Well, the only thing 4-star about Mandalay Bay is the price.... The service was absolutely horrible. We asked the concierge for directions to the Valley of Fire - only after waiting for him to chat with another co-worker as the line grew, make a phone call, and then help us. He was very unhelpful and said he was out of maps. The valet parking was a joke - you had to wait 30 minutes to get the car - and this was with NO LINE. The room was adequate, but definitely not 4-star. The biggest thing was the bathroom, but since there were no mirrors in the main room, we all kept cramming into the bathroom so I'm glad it was big! There was a good layer of mold in the shower - heard of Tilex??? The furniture was minimal and there wasn't even a real dresser to unpack our bags, much less space to store our suitcases. The walls were quite thin and we could hear our neighbors come in as well as guests going up and down the hall. For the price, I'd expect much better service and a much nicer room. The lazy river was closed which was disappointing since I'd read about it on the internet (But nothing mentioned it being closed.) The beach was nice, but with only an inch between chairs, it was hardly relaxing or enjoyable. It was like a sea of people down there. The beach waitress was horrible and took over 20 minutes to bring our $10 drinks.... To top it all off, The Mandalay Bay is at the end of the strip so it's not convenient to any other places."

The other big positive was the buffet which in my opinion was the best value for money eating experience during my 10 days in Vegas. The quality and variety of food on offer for the money was exceptional - I suppose i'll have to go now and find my exercise bike!"

But that notwithstanding, everything was excellent. The hotel room is beautifal - I stayed in an \"average\" room - the bed was wonderful and the bathroom was fantastic as advertised in these reviews. I have eaten in many of the restaurants here before and they are all wonderful, this time I tried room service and for less than 25 dollars had a drink, club snadwich and crab appetizer - amazing value and tasty as well. I visited the pool area, but did not go in, the wave pool looked like fun but was very crowded as it was a hot day - in the 90's. I enjoyed hanging out in the casino and my room. Would definitely stay here again, looking forward to trying theHotel part of Mandalay Bay in the future."

So unlike many Vegas hotels you actually had freedom to walk to the check in desk without fighting huge crowds. eventually all 7 of us arrived and there was a mix up with the rooms. the staff was quick to accommodate with no questions asked. THEbathouse just opened the day before we arrived and it is awesome! an asian modern decor that i loved. make your reservations as soon as you get there it fills up quick (request the services guide upon check in, they offer a lot). All and all the rooms are great, 3 flat screens with a nice living room and bath. The only complaint is you have to use the pool at Mandalay Bay (although very nice) it is also very far.

The rooms have 3 plasma screen TV's, including the one in the bathroom which is perfect for soaking in the huge tub suitable for two and watching a little TV. Bath amenities are great quality, which is a little surprising for Vegas. The rooms are anything but standard and are usually a fraction of the price of some of the older, more popular hotels on the strip.

The person at the desk looked up my reservation and then informed me that they had over booked the hotel and asked me if we would not mined being transferred next door the the Mandalay bay, he said they would upgrade us to a penthouse room. I was looking forward to the new suite that we had booked at THEhotel but he reassured us that the room over the road would be better. So I agreed to move as long as the new room had tow queen beds. So off we went and walked and walked over and up to the top floor, opened our suite door and there it was a big lounge room and bar, then the bed room with only one king bed. This really pissed me off the guy at the desk told us there would be two beds as theirs no way I would sleep with my friend lol. So on the phone I was for like 20 minutes getting switched from one person to the next , I must have been transferred to like 6 people before I talked to someone that wanted to help me. They said they don?t have any suites with 2 beds in them and they could send up a rollaway for us.I said no way, they then said how about we give you two standard rooms, I said no that not good enough.I then went down to the reception to sort this mess out when I arrived down there they had suddenly founds us a two bedroom suite one of the biggest in the hotel. Off we went again up to our new room, it was wonderful its own lobby and lounge room, dinning room, 4 big screen Tvs, two separate bedrooms with there own bathroom and spa. The only thing wrong with the room was when I pulled the blinds back there was food left behind them from the last person .I phoned the manager which I waited 15mins to take to, explained the hole incident from start to finish and she apologized, offered me dinner and breakfast for two and a 9pm check out on out last night all for free. I would not stay at the mandalay bay resort again no way, but would sill like to try THEholel as that looked very nice, as long as they don?t over book again."

Housecleaning staff did an excellent job, although cleaning was always done late in the afternoon. Decent restaurants, friendly staff, great pool, and nice rooms. I thought the best thing about it was the general vibe of the casino and quality of the other guests. It wasn't cramped, there's no free show going on to bring in the gawkers and freebie-*****. Everybody on the gaming floor was having a good time and were still dressed nicely. Not ties and jackets all the time, but not cut-off shorts and tank tops either. Well worth it if you can afford it. Check out Shark Reef (kills an hour or two) and the massive rice krispie treats on the coffee side of the Orchid Lounge."

Because it's at the South side of the strip it's not as crowded as the hotels in the center of the strip because of the crowds milling around.The rooms and in particular the bathrooms are superb. Have seen a number of reviews regarding service (you'll see negative reviews at almost every hotel along the same line...) but the service we received was excellent. The Mandalay Bay is a class act and am looking forward to returning soon."

The pool area is rated the best in Vegas, but I wouldnt know because it was closed for the season. However, if it was anything like the rest of the hotel...I am sure it is perfect. Mandalay has great restaurants, lounges and the casino is very classy (as far as casinos go). You could eat every meal for five days at a different place in the Mandalay and they were also in the process of adding a new food court when we were there (even more restaurants!). The sportsbook area had a nice little deli, which offered cheaper food. These restaurants are not cheap. We spent a couple nights at the House of Blues and had a blast. It was very convenient to have a HOB right in our hotel. The rooms were very comfortable and offered great views. The bathroom was fantastic. Very very spacious with nice marble flooring, counters and a separate shower and jacuzzi tub. We explored most of the other resorts including Bellagio, Venetian, Paris, New York and I think that our hotel held its own with those places for a fraction of the price."

As I was waiting in a LONG line to check in, she watched this less-than professional woman operate a flower cart in the lobby. It was so cheap looking and out of place and left my wife with a very bad impression of the managment. The cart itself looked like it belonged at Excalibur (which was also a pit!) and frankly it just looked like a bad joke. If we wanted to stay at a flea market we would have stayed at Excalibur.All-in-all, far too much money for the service and rude staff behavior. Nice interior, but otherwise gross!"

The hotel at Mandalay Bay has ruined me for wanting to stay anywhere else.You can criticize its southern strip location, but after walking through the doors of THE hotel, with its sleek style and service, you won't care if you ever leave. THE hotel is that nice.If you like modern sophisticated elegance, you will love this hotel. The dark wood, rich fabrics and elegant furniture used in the rooms are spectacular. The suites are big. A plasma screen tv in every room(even the bathroom) is a nice touch. Watching tv while luxuriating in a huge soaker tub for two is so seductive.Each room of the suite is large and luxurious. The bed is the most comfortable in which I have slept. The bathrooms are expansive, with its aforementioned tv and tub. It also has a private wc, glassed-in shower area and twin sinks-- and some of the nicest skincare and bath products I have seen a hotel. I don't think this hotel room was missing a thing, from robe and slippers to CD/DVD player.The addage of 'you get what you pay for', has never been more true. I will stay there again, in a heartbeat...."

They had this ridiculous waiting line-the host was not taking names, just asking how many in the party and seating everyone randomly. It was disorganized but we were finally seated. Our waiter comes by and we ask for coffee and he took our order. His fly was totally unzipped. I ordered the cheapest breakfast on the menu-9.50 for french toast. The omelettes were about 12.- Do their eggs come from golden hens? So we waited and waited for coffee-like 10 minutes. I finally see our waiter and ask for our coffee. He doesn't come by for 5 more minutes so I told my boyfriend that I am giving him 2 more min., and if I dont see coffee were outta here. We didnt see him so we got up and left. We felt glad that we didnt give that place a dime and went and got an egg mcmuffin at McDonald's. Getting up and leaving was the best part of our experience here. I have no idea if the hotel owns this restaurant or if they rent out space. Either way-it sucked. Save your money."

But it certainly didn't meet my expectations. I believe that service is something that should be mandated from the top down. I have stayed at Four Seasons, Ritz Carltons and Fairmonts and it is apparent that management at those hotels makes **** sure that all staff are courteous and helpful, no matter what their position. Mandalay Bay could learn a thing or two (or ten) from the staff at those hotels."

We were not at all interested in the gaming floor, so I have no views on that (they all look the same to me), but the restaurants were a disappointment: very expensive, not especially good and a 10-minute walk from our rooms (not easy 3 times a day with kids).Another annoying thing for us Europeans - though this is found everywhere in the US - is the fact that the advertised prices for rooms & other facilities bear precious little ressemblance to the final overall cost. $195 per night sounds great, but this will invariably end up at more like $295 by the time they have added state tax, special tax, additional charges, security premium, oxygen tax, etc. I guess this is something you have to get used to on a trip to the States, but this sort of 'price manipulation' is misleading and illegal in Europe."

    "content": "Just got back from Mandalay Bay, having spent five days during the Christmas/New Years Holiday. Having met some people over at New York, New York, you can really see the difference when you enter this property. The waterfalls at the entrance and the front lobby are nothing less than impressive. Buffet restaurants always looked crowded, but why go to a buffet ? Mandalay Bay has a number of really great/fun places to go to dinner. The first night we went to the Border (Mexican) restaurant and had some great Margaritas with their Marinated Skirt Steak special. Then we went to Rumjungle and China Grill later that week, both are very good and sort of pricey (glass of Sonoma Chardonnay wine - $14). but the ambience is unique. The prize of this trip was dinner at Charlie Palmer's Restaurant at the Four Seasons Hotel (not to be confused with his other 'Aureole' Restaurant at the MB) The Four Seasons is co-located at Mandalay Bay, so you may have to ask around to locate this restaurant. I don't think service and quality gets much better than this top shelf restaurant. Also went to the House of Blues for Breakfast, its worth stopping in if you haven't been there before. The rooms are very comfortable, but not likely to hold up well over time. I noticed leaks developing in the ceilings and the construction and plumbing looks shoddy (I am a CPA). The wide style bathtub in our standard room did not have a jacuzzi, sort of expected, particularly when you have a lavish granite double-sinked bathroom, marble floors, etc. The TV has a live feed from the shark reef tank, we watched this every night - a great touch. Overall, I found the entire staff very helpful and pretty friendly. If you go there, consider asking for a high floor (32nd Fl) with a good view of the strip. The fact that MB is the last hotel on the southern past of the strip is a good thing. There were tons of people coming into the Hotel from other places to see the attractions and try the restaurants and casinos. If it were more cenrally located, I think it would be even more crowded. I didn't get a chance to use the Spa but I did take a quick tour. It looks like a first class facility, I will definitely try this out on my next visit. I didn't care for all the promotions they had for Mama Mia, one of their big entertainment attractions. It looks so contrived and overdone, I know I would walk out bored after 20 minutes. Saw David Copperfield at the MGM too. He also looked very very bored - the three shows appeared to be getting to him. He looked like he was rushing to get home earlier. For $100/ticket he needs to look a little more animated, a shame for such a talented illusionist. If you play Blackjack, you may not like all their rules (e.g., hit on soft 17). Check them out first or take a quick walk to Luxor via their new connecting mall Overall, this is really a great place to hang for a few days. Staying longer, you may start looking a bit too close at things and it may start losing its mystique. Have a great time !"

Being a first timer to Las Vegas I wasnt quite sure what to expect, but once we arrived at the hotel I was literally overwhelmed with the beauty and the overall cleanlieness throughout the entire place. Along with the high ceilings and spacious walkways, one could hardly smell a burning cigarette while on the casino floor. I also found the slot machines to be fairly loose compared to others we played at in different casinos. After visiting other hotels, (NYNY, MGM, Lux, Excalibur etc...) I felt the MB had the most relaxing and comfortable environment while gaming. The cocktail waitresses were courteous and very good looking. The drinks were pelntiful as well. As for the rooms, I had no complaints. Nothing was stolen or missing and I would even feel comfortable leaving a diamond necklace on the table. The beds were comfortable with plenty of pillows to rest your bones after a long day/night. We were on the 14th floor with a room that overlooked the strip, what an unbelieveable view! The bathrooms were fabulous. Double sinks, a seperate shower and an ample amount of soaps, shampoos and other toiletry items. We were also privilaged with a pass to take a seperate eleveator to the top of the MB to enjoy the stunning view of the strip at night. A breathtaking sight! The food at the MB was excellent. I found the cafe to have the best breakfast variety around. Try the fresh applejuice, it is to die for. The highlight of the trip had to be the Shania Twain concert. Besides being gorgeous, the woman can put on one hell of a show. As for the pool area, I never had a desire to venture out to that area, even though it was closed. I came to Vegas to spend a little money, see the sights, and most of all have a good time; not to waste a day being lazy and getting sunburned by the wave pool. If you have little children, dont even bother bringing them to Vegas. It is simply a place for adults. Schlitterbahn or Walt Disney Land would be more sufficient. All in all I was pleased with the MB and would definately stay there again in the future. If youre looking for a place to spoil yourself, Mandalay Bay is the place."

Every staff person I encounter was very nice and polite. Even the boucers at their night clubs, Rumjumgle and The Dragen at China Grill, were courteous. I had no problems during both of my stays. The Bayside Buffet is good. I don't gamble so I have no opinion on the casino, other then it looks marvelous. I didn't get to swim in their pools, because both times I was there it was too cold. But I was able to stroll around, and from what can see, it looks pretty good. It is pretty expensive to stay and play here. I would definitly reccomend Mandalay Bay for special occasions like weddings, honeymoons, anniversaries, graduations, holidays, or birthdays. If you have the money, go for it and try to go there during the summer so you can swimm in the pools which I was unfortunatily not able to enjoy. I've stayed at many hotels on the strip and Mandaylay Bay is one of the best. It's a great hotel that I will definitly return."

I didn't have any of the troubles some of you had with checking in, but my room the second trip had several problems. First of all, it's great that they give you the double sink. However, one of the sinks didn't work. Oh, well. I was staying alone, so I just ignored it (I reported it at checkout so they could attend to it before the next guest was placed there). The other problem was much more difficult to ignore. They have some sort of a vent system at the bottom of the windows to allow fresh air (from outside) into the room since in Vegas, nearly all windows in rooms don't open. Well, there was something wrong with my vent. I could either have it wide open and it BLEW COLD AIR IN, or I could try to close it, and it leaked and made a REALLY LOUD whistling sound. I reported this, then had to face maintenance men in the room for hours. They never entirely solved the problem, and the hotel was full, so they were unable to move me to another room. While I understand that this sort of problem is beyond their control, if they cared about my happiness, they would have offered something in compensation such as a discount or upgrade on my next stay. They offered no such thing. They also seem to be cutting corners on staff. There is no reason why valet service needs to take over half an hour to get your car! They can hire more valets at the rates they charge. There's no reason why you should have to wait for a seat at a blackjack table (or at least a $10 minimum table) when there are dozens of tables closed. Call in more dealers and pit bosses, and open the tables! Also, when I first started coming, there was even more space dedicated to table games, but they tore them out and put in more slot machines. I HATE that! I still love the ambience of the hotel - the high ceilings and pleasant smell in the casino are 100% unique in Las Vegas - no other casino is this nice. I like the design of the bathrooms (as long as everything is working). I like the layout of the place (although too many stupid people congregate on main pathways and block traffic). I've only stayed at the Mandalay Bay in the winter, so I haven't been able to enjoy their pool, and I haven't yet tried the spa, although I would like to in the future. I go to Vegas to gamble, plain and simple. I want everything else surrounding the gambling to be pleasant and easy, and I don't want anything that wastes my time and keeps me away from my game (such as elevators that are so overpacked that it can take 10 minutes to catch one with any space available). Mandalay Bay should recognize these problems and address them immediately before gamblers choose to go elsewhere, and they're left with only resort vacationers."

The Rum Jungle is very exotic and pricey, but worth trying once in a lifetime. I was also sad that all the pools were closed."

Wonderful view of the strip.The room has the usual appointments, what can I say about the bathroom, spacious. The ceiling to floor windows are a nice touch too. The room was always cleaned first thing in the morning. I've read negative reviews on this sight concerning housekeeping issues, and I quite honestly wonder why they were written. The hotel halls, and common areas were always clean. We didn't do alot of gambling at the hotel as I feel the table limit is a tad bit too high. $25.00 minimum blackjack tables. My husband and I did play slots a little, but we're more into the table games so we just took the tram or the new beautiful walkway and played blackjack at Luxor or Excalibur, don't laugh. Both of these casinos have $5.00 min bets and my husband and I were up about $600.00 one night. Join the One Club(its free) both of these casinos will rate you. We did eat at the House of Blues(filet mignon, was tasy), and ate at a little cafe, I think it was called Red White & Blue, was a little bit pricey for the quality of food, but hey, you're in Vegas. Most other meals were eaten at different casinos, I like to try different things, but not where lodging is concerned. MB, in my opinion is right there with Venetian. The surrondings truly are spacious and relaxing. The casino is laid out nicely, it doesn't take you too long to get a feel for your way around. Some of the reviews on this site spoke negativley about the drink service. While my husband and I were playing slots the waitress was always there. All in all we were very pleased with the srvice and the quality of MB. We're planning a trip in 2004 and there will be no other place than MB for us."

    "content": "We are down for a golf trip Nov 4-6 2003.This is one very nice hotel with lots of marble everywhere. Check-in was efficient. Looking to soak in the hot tub & go for a swim after a stressful day of golf. We are informed the pool closes at 5pm. It was a tad frustrating when the a hotel with a \"south pacific\" themed hotel would have a pool we couldn't use. We had just come from golfing in Mesquite at Eurecka Hotel and their pool is open till 11pm. Eurecka has quite a bit less marble in the lobby, but I'll take their pool hours. The room was very nice. Huge bathroom with lots more marble. Tub was fine to make up a little bit for no hot tub. The separate shower was a nice touch. I asked for their best rate and $99 was available if you paid right away and it was non-refund rate. Better than the $189 that allowed you to cancel. The hotel's buffet is great for breakfast-on a par with Bellagio's which I always liked. Red, White & Blue wasn't. Why serve coffee in a stainless pot-its cold in 2 minutes. Rumjungles has an interesting theme of water running down the walls. Our waiter was excellent. Food is Brazillian theme where they carve different kinds of meat at the table. It was not hot enough by my taste, by the time the meat hit us. Later ladies danced above you in neon coloured bathing suits when it turned into a night club. It was different, but it didn't hold our interest. If you are in a hurry to get your car you need to leave some money at the valet desk. Boy, does it come fast. If you didn't clue in...I think you'd be waiting a long time. Thats another plus for smaller, self park casinos. I would stay again, if I got a decent deal since it is a classy hotel & I could over look a few flaws if its just for a few nights."

After some terrible Mexican food for lunch, we decided to try out the Red, White, and Blue restuarant for an late afternoon bowl of soup. The table was sticky. We ordered some onion and some chicken soup. Both came out cold. We asked for them to be reheated and asked for a basket of rolls. The soup came out ten minutes later and still no rolls. By the time we asked for the check, they brought out some stale sliced frech bread. The weather was great. The wave pool was tremendous. The rest of my stay was typical banquet food, which was fair. I think I'll go back to the Bellagio next time"

    "content": "After much research on where to stay in Las Vegas, we selected Mandalay Bay, it was my 50th Birthday so I was hoping to have a great memory and I do. Manadalay Bay was excellent in every way. The check in was fast and the service was great ! We had requested a higher floor with the pool view and that was what we got. Nathan at the check in desk took his time and found the room and view we requested. This hotel is very clean and all service from room service to maid service was excellent. Room service was fast and courteous. There was staff posted as you enter the elevators always available for information and directions. We visited many hotels and of course took cabs wherever we went. Las Vegas is busy of course but of all the hotels we departed from going to and from Manadalay Bay we found taxi service was quick even at the most busiest times which was in the evening when everyone was leaving for a show or dinner. Other hotels were slow and the lines were long to get a taxi. Perhaps this might not be an important factor to some people but believe me whe you have to get to a show it is an important factor. The restaurants were excellent and the staff and service was great. We visited Shark Reef and even though the line was long it was worth it. Being from SC I have seen many aquariums but I must say this was very nice. I found this resort to be very friendly and I was not dissapointed in any way. I read many reviews on other hotels before I selected Mandalay Bay and I'm glad we chose it. Sure the hotels in Las Vegas are beautiful but what is beauty without service. Mandalay Bay has beauty , fun, and service. I would stay there again I have such wonderful memories !"

    "content": "We stayed at Mandalay Bay during the Mr. Olympia on Oct. 24-27, 2003. Granted, this was a very large event being held at the Mandalay Bay and it was very busy all over the resort. Our check-in host was very professional during the madhouse of LOTS of people checking in at the same time. We were given our choice of floors but notified that the rooms were not yet clean but a request would be made to expedite housekeeping services. We were told we could put our luggage in the room while we wait for it to be cleaned. We did this and took off for three hours. When we returned, the room had still not been cleaned so I called housekeeping and they said they would send someone right up. This took another hour and a half. The room was adequate and the bathroom was roomy. The separate tub and shower was nice. We were slightly disappointed with Housekeeping. We did not receive standard items like shampoo and bath salts a couple of times. The pool area is vast and there are many different atmospheres to choose from. The bar, however, was pretty far from the water and barstools are not available at the bar itself. The cabana staff were extremely friendly and competent, checking with us numerous times. The cabanas are average and kind of secluded away from the pools so people watching is not really an option. The only issue I had with the pool scene is that the atmosphere is one of segregation. There are some beautiful areas that are nicely appointed but you either have to pay extra to enter or lose a lot of money in the casino to get into the nicer areas. LOTS of shopping and eating experiences. I would say the entertainment is stellar at Mandalay Bay. We had Rodizio-style dinner at Rum Jungle and it was excellent. The staff were friendly and attentive. We went back for an evening of dancing and had a great time. Cage dancers and acrobatics were great, music was great, bartenders were excellent. Red Square is a great experience with the ice bar, etc. Bottom line, our stay was nice but I would try other venues closer to the center of the strip for more convenience to other locations (MGM Grand has a better atmoshpere in the casino.) Mandalay Bay is nice if you plan to remain at the resort for your entire stay but you may feel ultrasecluded."

    "content": "I stayed at the Mandalay Bay Resort October 22-26, 2003 for the Olympia Bodybuilding & Fitness competitions. My first trip to Vegas was 3 1/2 years ago and this was my 6th. The Mandalay is my 5th hotel in Vegas. My plane was 40 minutes EARLY so that put me at the front desk at 10:35am, when check-in starts at 12:00pm. The clerk, a young lady named Brittany, gently informed me that I was 90 minutes early. I knew where this was going, so I flashed a smile and mentioned to her that I had asked about this situation when I confirmed my reservation over the phone and that I was told that if a room was ready it would be mine. Brittany was very professional and didn't miss a beat and simply nodded and punched in my name. She then asked what floor I preferred and if I wanted a poolside view. Jackpot-I thanked her profusely. Bottom line: I walked into the lobby at 10:35am and was in my room at 10:50am. It pays to be courteous (and mildly flirtatious). She could have very easily had me wait the 90 minutes and then given me a room overlooking a dumpster. The room was large and the bathrooms are some of the best on the strip. The double sinks, separate water closet, separate shower and large soaking tub are luxurious when compared to most other Las Vegas hotels. The pool and Beach area was fantastic. It was not that crowded as some have written, but I was not there during Memorial Day or 4th of July either. I worked on my tan, played in the waves, and enjoyed the lazy river. The Moorea Beach area is open. It is the \"European Style\" or topless bathing area. The buffet was pretty good. The dinner spread was slightly better than the other resorts. The other restaurants in the hotel were also pretty darn good. I recommended the lobster fettucini at Raffles Cafe. When I was there they were finishing up a walkthrough mall that connects the Mandalay to the Luxor. I stopped at Forever Silver jewelry store and picked up a little thank you for the wife that lets her husband go to Vegas alone. All the check-in, room, buffet, pool, shopping, and service were topnotch. The Mandalay often is pricier that other resorts, but it is billed as one of maybe 4 luxury resorts and I got what I paid for. I will definitely stay there again."

Every person was friendly and went out of their way to assist. The casino is beautiful. Nice and clean and not cramped. They should lower the price of the beer in the casino and at the pool.

A good variety of deserts also. The best part is that you feel that you are eating at a restaurant not a buffet. the decor is great and comftable. The service is surperb. The plates were cleaned off promptly, beverage was always refilled and at the desert time, they came over to ask if i wanted coffee or tee even though it wasn't the beverage I was drinking.

We were charged $10.00 for 2 bottles of water that were never in our room (they did take that off the bill). It is impossible to get a chair at the pool unless you arrive early in the morning. The cabana's were completely booked for a week so reservations should be made prior to your arrival. The employees don't seem friendly and the dealers rarely smile. I can't remember a cocktail waitress ever coming by my machine. Nobody seems to win here and the casino was so cold inside, much colder than all the rest we visited.

I felt that more as if I was staying in a resort rather than a casino hotel.Most areas were very pleasing to the senses - I loved the color schemes, the sights and the smells of the tropical theme.The check-in wasn't all that bad (we got there at noon) and I enjoyed viewing the aquarium and presentation of tropical birds while waiting (10 min tops).I didn't find the elevator waits to be long at all - no longer than any other business building.We got a discount room on account of a convention we were attending ($80/night) so I didn't expect much from the room, but was pleasantly surprised! Although the room overlooked the rooftops the window was one complete side of the room and the view of the mountains in the sunrise was gorgeous. Our room was clean, absent of scent. The beds were clean and firm. We had a room safe as well. Can't say enough about the bathroom! Huge, with a large, deep tub, separate glass shower, separate toilet room, large double black marble sinks with upper class ammenities such as bath salts and mouthwash. Only complaints: after the maid left, we encountered a woman leaving the room (she said it was a routine inspection?) although nothing was missing or out of order, also they promised us joining rooms upon checkin and found out that they lied upon entering.Alas, everything costs extra at Mandalay Bay. There was no coffee maker in the room, you have to purchase coffee within the hotel (only Starbucks coffee available), no complimentaty paper and the workout room/spa is $35/day. However they make up for it in the spa area - it was hard to get us out once we entered.Although the wave pool isn't what we expected (1 gentle wave every 5 min) and the lazy river smaller than we hoped, I wasn't that disappointed. One hint: bring your own tube/raft as it costs $20/day to rent (or come after 3PM as people leave them behind as they leave). Rental for small lockers are $1-2 per turn of the key. We were able to find plenty of chairs in the back of the beaches when we visited, although I wish they would collect towels to encourage people to take them when they leave.Luckily, due to Mandalay Bay being on the end of the strip, the influx of tourists is at a minimum, which made for a less crowded casino floor. After visiting the other casinos, it was a relief to get back and be able to move without constantly bumping into people.Bathrooms throughout Mandalay's casino floor were clean and pleasant smelling.Although there is a wide selection of restaurants to choose from, we only ate at the House of Blues, so I can only comment on that one, but the service and food was excellent and they offered us a 2 for 1 breakfast.Valet service and the service at the Bell Desk were very slow, but the servers were quite accommodating (seemed as the problem was more a small number of available employees rather than apathy).In the end I was very pleased with the quality of our stay and will visit again."

I was not disappointed. The wave pool was great. Getting a lounge chair in a nearby area can be very difficult, especially if you need more than one (no one removed their soiled towels when they were done with the chairs), but this is common at all Vegas hotels; no worse here. The standard room was a major surprise. I'd say about 1/4-1/3 of the square footage was for the bathroom. At first I thought this was ridiculous. But then it grew on me. It was all marble (look-alike?), 2 spacious sinks, a large tub (I'm 6'4\" and I fit!) and a separate glass walled shower....Oh and a separate very small room with door for the toilet. Its a man's dream! Complaints- My room had a obvious stain on the carpet that looked like a footprint and it didn't look new. More significantly, the elevators are not adequate for the volume of people using them. I was here midweek, and still the wait for an elevator (there are 8 for the guest rooms) was frequent and lengthy. In addition when I would finally get one to go down to the lobby, it would land up stopping on EVERY floor on the way down."
